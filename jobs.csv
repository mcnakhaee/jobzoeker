Join ReBioClim, a Project Aiming to Pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in Four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.
* Ability to work independently and in a result-oriented way.
* Availability to start in January 2025.


Nice-to-haves:


* Experience in conducting geospatial analysis in a programming environment such as R or Python.
* Knowledge of co-design workshop methodologies.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service.

Join ReBioClim, a project aiming to pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.
* Ability to work independently and in a result-oriented way.
* Availability to start in January 2025.


Nice-to-haves:


* Experience in conducting geospatial analysis in a programming environment such as R or Python.
* Knowledge of co-design workshop methodologies.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

**Background**


Within ING we make use of data science for a variety of use cases (such as improving financial health of our customers by transaction forecasting). The data science models which run in production all generate output this data needs to be delivered to different destination within ING. These destinations vary from data lakes and kafka topics to Cassandra datastores.


In the past a generic Interface format (GI) was developed as a one size fits all solution to standardize the output delivery for our data-scientists. Over time many models have adopted this interface but we are now facing challenges such as files which became too big or the throughput time is too long.

**The opportunity**


We would like to deep-dive into this topic by dedicating an intern as engineer to investigate our use cases and look for a future proof solution. This includes gathering information, do market research (buy vs built) and design / develop one or more prototypes together with our data-scientists data engineers.

**Team** **overview**


You, as an intern will join one of our data-engineering teams which support the ING data-scientists. The teams work on a variety of topics to maintain and evolve our data-analytics environment in Google Cloud.

* Located in our Amsterdam office.
* Mix of local and off-shore colleagues (so multiple nationalities)
* We work in agile teams based around Scrum and continuous delivery principles.
* Our teams work in hybrid mode, we work from home when possible and work from the office at least one day a week.
* We have 36 hour working weeks.

**Roles and responsibilities**


This assignment is about understanding and improving our way of distributing data-science model output. The current implementation of GI (Generic Interface) needs to be examined as well as our use cases and the industry standards available. The goal is to boost new alternatives and bring us further in achieving an excellent data-driven organization.

**Expected l****earnings**

You will be working in an environment with modern continuous delivery tools with people who have a continuous improvement mindset. Tools include Azure (CDaaS), Google GCP (Terraform, Vertex AI, BigQuery), NiFi for data flow management.


Working in a complex environment such as ING can be challenging and this is part of the learning and our people and teams are there to help you.


Communication and collaboration are key and this involves working closely together with domain experts such as data-engineers, data-scientists and machine learning engineers.

**Expected output**


An inventory of required features, an improved understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the current implementation and a redesign plus implementation plan (part of this can also contain a buy vs built decision or a vendor selection).


When time allows the output also consists of the implementation of a prototype solution.

**How to succeed**


You can succeed in this role by showing:

* a “can-do” mentality
* you are a “self starter” (pro-active)
* you speak out and like to challenge yourself and the people around you
* you have a background in IT, information management or similar
* experience and affinity with machine learning is very useful
* it helps if you like programming (python, java, scala) though this is not a show stopper

**Rewards and benefits**  

This is a great opportunity to train with highly skilled people who are experts in their field. You’ll do a lot and learn a lot –  

not only about your specialist area and the bank, but also about yourself and whether this type of environment is right for you.

  

You’ll also benefit from:

* Internship allowance of EUR 700/month for 36 hours (maximum)
* Compensation of travel costs
* Your own work laptop
* Hybrid working to blend home working for focus and office working for collaboration and co-creation

----------------


Are you a Bachelor or a Master student in computer science or a related field? Are you interested in making a difference by streamlining the current tooling that ASML's Machine Control group use, and improving the diagnostic workflow of our users? Then this internship could be interesting for you!

**Background information**

Within the Machine Control group, we are responsible for orchestrating and synchronizing all high-level behavioral actions. We have a large number of modules working in parallel in a large configuration space. Due to the large scale and complexity of the system, there is a need for an abstracted overview of the system.

  

We need such an overview for multiple reasons. It can be used to improve the overall understanding of the system, and it can be used by experts to quickly diagnose unexpected behavior, considerably reducing investigation time.

  

Currently, the process of creating such an overview is mostly manual and labor-intensive task sometimes assisted by rudimentary tooling. The existing tooling does not support diagnostics enough due to low user-friendliness and missing features.

**Assignment description**

The aim of your project is to take the existing tooling as a starting point, polish and extend it such that it can better facilitate diagnostics of the system behavior. In this assignment you will:

* Gather the needs of the experts;
* Ensure the system stores the data required to generate the overview;
* Streamline the tooling to improve the diagnostic workflow of the user;
* Closely interact with users to iteratively create a polished product.

**Your Profile**
----------------


To be a perfect fit for this assignment, you:

* Have background in Computer Science or related;
* Are a bachelor student looking to do your thesis (bachelor graduation project/thesis), or a master student looking to gain work experience (master apprentice);
* Are able to translate functional requirements and design in to software designs;
* Are experienced in Python (required), and experienced in C and/or C++ is a bonus.
* Have knowledge in diagnostic methods (preferred);


Other requirements you need to meet:

* You are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship;
* You need to be located in the Netherlands to be perform your internship. In case you ‘re currently living/studying outside of the Netherlands, please include in your CV/motivation letter willingness to relocate.

***This position seeks a junior scientific programmer to further develop and integrate existing movici and multi-model.nl platforms and support the development of new (multi-)models of infrastructure interactions. The work will be done in close cooperation with PhDs, postdoc, senior experts on modeling theory and decision-making and practitioners from infrastructure providers. This position can potentially be turned into a PhD postion.***


Job description


Infrastructures provide the basis for many critical societal processes, from economy to education, from healthcare to housing and more. The infrastructures are increasingly interdependent on each other, from providing mutual services (like energy and data for mobility), via to providing alternative capacity (like rail, road and waterways), to competing for the same space (like in urban contexts).



Models and simulations are key tools for decision makers, allowing them to build, design, and plan infrastructures. As the need for integrated, cross system insight rises, current monodisciplinary and mono-sectoral models are increasingly unable to provide the required insights. A promising direction is multi-modelling, where different models and simulations are combined in an ecosystem of tools, that can be used and re-used in different configurations. The model ecosystem, and the socio-technical approach to modelling poses new methodological and technical challenges.



Models are instrumental for supporting the social process of decision-making, and are not a goal in themselves. Key model and software requirements will stem from the users and the social process that they are involved in. You, as a developer will be involved in these processes where needed, but are not expected to organize and manage them.



Work will consist of two main lines, platform development and model development support. Platform development involves integration of existing open-source platforms MOVICI and multi-model.nl, identifying new requirements and features from the users and developing them. Model development includes software implementation and general computing and data analysis support for researchers, modelers and modelling and simulation theorists. You may also be asked for advice on the most suitable software solutions, data structures, architectures, code redesign where necessary.



Goal of the position is the further development of the MOVICI and multi-model.nl platform towards a tailored tool for broad impact analysis in a complex stakeholder environment. The later means a lot of attention for describing and modeling scenario’s, a wide range and flexible approach towards evaluative criteria for these scenario’s, clear visualizations in space and time on scenario development, and interconnection with other modeling platforms.



We are looking for a person who enjoys (re)design and implementation ""done right"", with long term maintainability, reusability and generalizability being important, without losing sight of practicality. Willingness to work closely with domain experts and modeling theorists is paramount. Correct and clean representation and implementation of the relevant concepts is much more important than churning out features quickly. You will be working in research focused academic setting, so affinity with science, scientific methods and processes is useful.


Requirements


The software stack is organised around open source workflows: git, python, docker, Apache Airflow, linux shell and some C++. We also make use of REST interfaces and client-server architectures where relevant. Prior experience with these technologies is desirable but is explicitly not expected. We do expect solid python programming ability, high level of general computing skills and eagerness to learn more, as well as a good command of the English language. Dutch proficiency is desired but not necessary.



This is a junior position, and your interests, willingness to learn and team fit are much more important than prior experience with specific technologies.



We are seeking a recent graduate from a computer science/ computer engineering / programming and/or data science-oriented MSc program, but candidates with different background are also encouraged to apply. The position could in term be changed to a modeling and simulation focused PhD position.



We expect that you will take the initiative, be independent and can handle a high degree of freedom, especially in the technical domain. However, you will not be left alone to “figure it all out by yourself”. You will be part of a team that takes personal development and growth, mental health and neurodiversity seriously. You will be working closely with Dr. Ir. I Nikolic, and Prof. Dr. W. Veeneman.

Then we have an opportunity for you.

  



**Job Description**  

In the plastic packaging value chain, there is only limited information available on the plastics in that chain to assess circularity and recyclability goals, especially the use of post-consumer recyclates (PCR) in packaging.

  


Quality specifications, monitoring, and standardisation of materials are common in certain industries like chemistry and pharma but are, at this point, only in an infancy state in plastic waste management. A major challenge when it comes to mechanical recycling of plastics is that the quality of the material is not monitored throughout the whole process. Inline monitoring is however essential for predicting the final quality of PCR.

  


In the MoQuP-R project, we focus on the necessary quality monitoring tools and the application of existing models related to the prediction of recyclate quality in order to increase the use of PCR in packaging. In this project your responsibilities will entail:


* Review literature to identify potential inline analytical methods to monitor quality parameters.
* Adapt laboratory and/or offline analytical techniques to be used inline in polymer processing equipment.
* Propose and execute design changes to polymer processing equipment to enable inline measurements.
* Design experiments using polymer processing equipment and post-consumer plastics to apply and develop monitoring tools.
* Evaluate the different methods in relation to PCR quality.
* Manage a work package in the MoQuP-R project.
* Present your work at international conferences, MoQuP-R consortium meetings, and other events and write scientific papers for international peer-reviewed journals.
* Provide teaching assistance and/or supervision of researchers and students.

  




As a Postdoctoral Researcher you will work in the Circular Plastics team in the Faculty of Science and Engineering located at Brightlands Chemelot Campus in Geleen. You will become part of a young international research group, specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics with a strong polymer science background. Your will work together with Rudinei Fiorio on this exciting topic.

  


**Requirements**  

We expect you to have the following experience, knowledge, and skills:


* A PhD degree in mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, process analysis, mechatronics, or similar;
* Advanced skills in CAD and interfacing sensor data to analysis software (e.g. Python, Matlab, Simulink);
* Good knowledge on analytical techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, GCMS;
* Skills in polymer processing;
* Experience with industry collaborations is considered advantageous;
* Proficiency in both written and spoken English.

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.
* Masters degree, PhD or equivalent experience in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, etc.).
* We prefer candidates with Deep Learning experience, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. Experience with TensorFlow is a plus.
* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.

Then this is the perfect job for you!
  
Knab was founded in 2012. We are an online bank, but one run by real people. We are known for being different because we want to do things differently. Simpler, smarter, and more affordable for our customers. By combining smart technology with a healthy dose of common sense, we create financial services that meet your needs. We add sublime, personal service to this, creating something unique in the financial sector.  

  

**Your role and responsibilities**  

Are you passionate about problem solving and combining the use of different tools in your daily work? And are you interested in the interest rate risk and enjoy improving processes? As a Senior ALM Specialist you will be responsible for managing and modelling interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) in a small and engaged team.  

  

Furthermore, the role will include at least the following:


* Managing the interest rate risk through hedging and designing optimal risk steering;
* Developing and refining interest rate related models (e.g. non-maturing deposits, cash flows, prepayments, mortgage pipeline, hedge accounting);
* Shaping decision-making, policies and analyses for senior management;
* Reporting the IRRBB and FX position to ALCO;
* Staying up-to-date with the latest changes in regulation (i.e. EBA, BCBS 239) related to IRRBB management;
* Enhancing reporting processes with regard to the automation and quality of the reported data;
* Assisting junior team members in their professional development.


The current interest rate environment and changes in EBA IRRBB regulation make it a very dynamic and exciting time to be part of a first-line of defence ALM team. The combination of the current economic climate, a flat-structured bank and a wide range of projects offer you a great opportunity to grow professionally and develop a holistic view on interest rate risk of the bank.  

  

**The team**  

The Asset and Liability Management & Methodology (ALM&M) team’s goal is to deliver on Knab’s strategy by optimizing the balance sheet of Knab. We do this by ensuring that the interest rate risk and funding positions of Knab are managed within the boundaries set in the strategies for those risks whilst not losing sight of the profitability of the bank.  

  

We believe in assigning ownership instead of tasks and, as a result, everyone within the ALM&M team gets the chance to own and be in the lead of a focus area within our team. This creates a flat structure which enables people to take initiative and develop their professional career on their own terms.  

  

On a personal side, we are a fun and multi-national team of curious and knowledgeable people. We perceive work as a challenge to improve ourselves and the bank. We like to work together and learn from each other through regular knowledge sharing sessions. We also enjoy spending time together outside of the work (e.g. having a drink or a game of padel.  

  

**Your profile**  

To be successful in this role, this is the kind of traits we have in mind:


* Completed masters degree in (Quantitative) Finance, Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics or similar;
* 5-7 years of relevant working experience in financial modelling, ALM or balance sheet management;
* Experience with Python, R, VBA (Excel) or C++ is a must, SQL is a plus;
* Experience with ALM / risk software solutions such as QRM or Ambit Focus is preferred;
* Ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and concise way;
* Self-starter with the ability, agility and motivation for self-learning;
* Excellent control of the English language, both written and verbally. Dutch is a bonus.


Did you know that according to research, women are less likely to apply than men when they don't meet all the job requirements? What a shame. Because, in our view, 'the perfect candidate' is a myth. So, if you have the drive to grow in aspects of this role, we look forward to your application.  

  

**This is Knab and this is what we offer you**  

Come as you are. Knab is an open workplace with positive vibes. We are inclusive of all nationalities, races and genders. We feel comfortable to bring our authentic whole selves to work and like you to do so too.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems.

* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**
=================

* Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.

=====================

* **We are on a mission** to make programming biology easy. We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.
* We're an **experienced team**. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!
* We're focused on building the **best possible team culture**. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.
* We offer **top of the market** salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.


**Responsibilities**:


As a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:

* Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools
* Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations
* Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process
* Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain
* Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.
* Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem

**Need to haves**
=================

* Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills
* You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.
* You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer\*, or even implement a UI plugin.
* You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.
* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**
=================

* Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.
* A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.
* You have worked with databases or big data systems.
* You have designed user interfaces and are familiar with one or more of the popular frameworks.
* You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.
* Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Cradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.**  

  

We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.


You will be joining a high-growth, highly ambitious startup with an experienced founding team, whose motivation is building a more sustainable world using biology. We are backed by some of the most well known investors and industry veterans. Joining us now means you will be getting in on the ground floor; you will have a significant impact on how we shape the company, and success will mean an outsized reward.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Simpler, smarter, and more affordable for our customers. By combining smart technology with a healthy dose of common sense, we create financial services that meet your needs. We add sublime, personal service to this, creating something unique in the financial sector.  

  

**Your role and responsibilities**  

Are you passionate about problem solving and combining the use of different tools in your daily work? And are you interested in the interest rate risk and enjoy improving processes? As a Senior ALM Specialist you will be responsible for managing and modelling interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) in a small and engaged team.  

  

Furthermore, the role will include at least the following:


* Managing the interest rate risk through hedging and designing optimal risk steering;
* Developing and refining interest rate related models (e.g. non-maturing deposits, cash flows, prepayments, mortgage pipeline, hedge accounting);
* Shaping decision-making, policies and analyses for senior management;
* Reporting the IRRBB and FX position to ALCO;
* Staying up-to-date with the latest changes in regulation (i.e. EBA, BCBS 239) related to IRRBB management;
* Enhancing reporting processes with regard to the automation and quality of the reported data;
* Assisting junior team members in their professional development.


The current interest rate environment and changes in EBA IRRBB regulation make it a very dynamic and exciting time to be part of a first-line of defence ALM team. The combination of the current economic climate, a flat-structured bank and a wide range of projects offer you a great opportunity to grow professionally and develop a holistic view on interest rate risk of the bank.  

  

**The team**  

The Asset and Liability Management & Methodology (ALM&M) team’s goal is to deliver on Knab’s strategy by optimizing the balance sheet of Knab. We do this by ensuring that the interest rate risk and funding positions of Knab are managed within the boundaries set in the strategies for those risks whilst not losing sight of the profitability of the bank.  

  

We believe in assigning ownership instead of tasks and, as a result, everyone within the ALM&M team gets the chance to own and be in the lead of a focus area within our team. This creates a flat structure which enables people to take initiative and develop their professional career on their own terms.  

  

On a personal side, we are a fun and multi-national team of curious and knowledgeable people. We perceive work as a challenge to improve ourselves and the bank. We like to work together and learn from each other through regular knowledge sharing sessions. We also enjoy spending time together outside of the work (e.g. having a drink or a game of padel.  

  

**Your profile**  

To be successful in this role, this is the kind of traits we have in mind:


* Completed masters degree in (Quantitative) Finance, Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics or similar;
* 5-7 years of relevant working experience in financial modelling, ALM or balance sheet management;
* Experience with Python, R, VBA (Excel) or C++ is a must, SQL is a plus;
* Experience with ALM / risk software solutions such as QRM or Ambit Focus is preferred;
* Ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and concise way;
* Self-starter with the ability, agility and motivation for self-learning;
* Excellent control of the English language, both written and verbally. Dutch is a bonus.


Did you know that according to research, women are less likely to apply than men when they don't meet all the job requirements? What a shame. Because, in our view, 'the perfect candidate' is a myth. So, if you have the drive to grow in aspects of this role, we look forward to your application.

The sub-team focusing on ESG Data has been active for almost a year. As a member of this team, the goal is to collaboratively build an ESG Data platform with IT Developers to supply the team involved in Sustainable Finance Regulation Modelling with the necessary data to monitor ESG risk.  

  

Given the significance that regulatory authorities attribute to modelling and the underlying data, this role is challenging and impactful.

* Collection of all data requirements for the models;
* Gap analysis of the data requirements for the SFR regulation and the data already available on the platform;
* Planning of the delivery of the required data;
* Actual delivery of dataset to the consumers.


  

Once the platform is ready, you will be involved in the data collection process. Your duties will encompass technical aspects such as SQL and Python programming, performing Data Quality analyses, and integrating datasets. Simultaneously, you'll be working on documentation and utilizing your communicative skills for stakeholder alignment. Active participation in frequent team meetings, where knowledge-sharing and progress transparency are key, is also expected.

* Discussing data requirements for different ESG risk models and reports with the modellers and reporting analysts;
* Make an inventory of the relevant databases within the bank and gain access to them;
* Combine tables (merge / link) and aggregate data in SQL and Python;
* Apply Data Quality Analysis, for example, course over time, missing values, extreme values;
* Investigate the plausibility of the new data;
* Document the data sourcing process and descriptive statistics and discuss this with the business parties;
* Additionally, there are many ad hoc activities, and you will regularly participate in cross-departmental projects. Your ability and willingness to collaborate are crucial for success in this role. You naturally take initiative, organize work effectively, and eagerly work with others to deliver tangible results. You possess a practical, analytical approach and strong communication and presentation skills. Being a robust team player, you take responsibility for your work.

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=0c48e3966dd23e85,indeed,Site Reliability Engineer (DevOps),Vattenfall,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Vattenfall,"Amsterdam, NH, NL",fulltime,2024-07-23,,,,,False,,,ewa.krajewska@vattenfall.com,"**Over de functie**
-------------------

 **Do you want to commit to a critical challenge and help to shape our future?**


We keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages, and configuration errors.


We are looking for a team member who is driven by technical challenges and the urge to always find better and more efficient ways of delivering services to the customer.  

  

**What will you do?**


In the role as SRE engineer you will combine the skillset of dev teams and operations teams by applying a software engineering approach to IT operations.


To succeed in this role it is important that you are self-driven, exact, analytic, critical and know how to prioritize. You are not only an expert in your field but you also have social competence and understand the business needs. You always challenge yourself and others to improve. You are also open for suggestions from others and can also give your own.


You are a team player and have a hands-on mindset, a strong customer- and problem-solving orientation. You show fast results, and you have demonstrated good communication skills, especially in an international organization. You need to be able to work independently in an international team that meets more virtually than physically.

  

  

**Your tasks and responsibilities:**

**Maintaining Applications to Help Operations and Support Teams**


As a SRE you are in charge of proactively implementing and maintaining infrastructure and business applications. This can be anything from provisioning servers, updating systems, deploying new software, providing pre-emptive maintenance to monitoring and alerting to code changes in production. A site reliability engineer can be tasked with building a homegrown tool from scratch to help with weaknesses in software delivery or incident management.


You must always be looking to improve quality and efficiency and cut costs.

**Fixing Support Escalation Issues**


Similarly to the point above, a site reliability engineer can be expected to spend time fixing support escalation cases.

**Optimizing On-Call Rotations and Processes**


More times than not, site reliability engineers will need to take on-call responsibilities and improve system reliability through the optimization of on-call processes. You will help add automation and context to alerts – leading to better real-time collaborative response from on-call responders. Additionally, you will update runbooks, tools and documentation to help prepare your on-call team members for future incidents.

**Documenting “Tribal” K****nowledge**


As you gain exposure to systems in both staging and production, as well as all technical teams, you will take part in work with software development, support, IT operations and on-call duties – meaning you will build up a great amount of historical knowledge over time. Instead of keeping this knowledge in the mind of one team or one person, as SRE you are expected to document much of what you know. Constant upkeep of documentation and runbooks can ensure teams get the information they need right when they need it.

**Conducting Post-Incident Reviews**


Without thorough post-incident reviews, you have no way to identify what’s working and what’s not. As such you will be participating in post-incident reviews, documenting your findings and taking action on your learnings.


Maybe also add \""provision new servers\""... it is attractive to have a more technical approach to woo away developers and coordinators!

 **Location**  

  

Katowice, Gliwice, Amsterdam or Solna

**Jouw profiel**
----------------

 **Who are you?**  

  

As our Site Reliability Engineer you:

* Are an expert in your field, strong technical and analytical skills, can solve impossible problems.
* Have the ability to translate complicated technical matters into simple understandable language.
* Have experience in building and operating of server virtualization environments.
* Have thorough knowledge of operating systems (Linux/Windows 2019 and up).
* Work with Agile methodology.
* Have experience in troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
* Are able to deal with tight deadlines when they arise.
* Have automation experience with at least one configuration/deployment management system (Ansible, Jenkins pipelines, Azure DevOps…).
* Have experience with at least one of the following scripting languages (Powershell, Shell, Python…).
* Have experience working with GIT.
* Have experience developing CI/CD.

  

Next to this you bring:

* Experience in a large international environment is desirable.
* Experience with containers is a plus.

* **Diverse and internationally distributed team**: joining our team means becoming part of a large, global community with people of more than 90 nationalities. We're more than just colleagues; we're a group of professionals with a shared mission to connect diverse cultures. Our global presence is growing–we've doubled in size nearly every year, with our employees based in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the US, and Japan, and we continue to expand our network.


* **Open communication, regular feedback**: as a language-focused company, we value the importance of clear, honest communication. We value smooth collaboration, direct and actionable feedback, and believe that leading with empathy makes us better together.


* **Remote work, flexible hours**: whether you're near or in our hubs in cities like Cologne, Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Austin, or Tokyo, or prefer the comfort of your own home, you decide where your office is. We offer remote opportunities, flexible working hours and trust in your productivity, all in sync with your team's general locations and time zones to foster effective and seamless collaboration. Our aim is to integrate your work with your lifestyle, ensuring a balance that respects both your needs and our operational requirements.


* **Regular in-person team events**: we bond over vibrant events that are as unique as our team, from local team and business unit gatherings, to new-joiner onboardings and company-wide events that bring us all together–literally.

At DeepL, it's about the value you bring and the growth we can foster together. Go ahead, apply—let's discover your potential together. We can't wait to meet you!**

 ***We do it right:*** When you’re moving fast it can be tempting to constantly cut corners to things done. But this results in a product that is a struggle to work with and has unhappy users. We make that extra effort to be proud of what we’re building; understand the problem we’re solving, write one more test or tackle technical debt.

 ***We are empowered to act, challenge and lead:*** To work effectively as a team everyone must have a voice and feel they can stand up and be counted. As a software engineer at Returnista we want you to feel empowered. That could mean proposing new ideas, fixing things without seeking permission or challenging the CEO.

 ***We are intrepid:*** We want our engineers to show initiative and to innovate. Intrepid Friday’s give us the opportunity to work on things that might not ostensibly be the highest priority, but can make a big difference to our product or how we work.

=====================

* **We are on a mission** to make programming biology easy. We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.
* We're an **experienced team**. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!
* We're focused on building the **best possible team culture**. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.
* We offer **top of the market** salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.


**Responsibilities**:


As a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:

* Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools
* Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations
* Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process
* Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain
* Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.
* Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem

**Need to haves**
=================

* Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills
* You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.
* You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer\*, or even implement a UI plugin.
* You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.
* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**
=================

* Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.
* A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.
* You have worked with databases or big data systems.
* You have designed user interfaces and are familiar with one or more of the popular frameworks.
* You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.
* Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Cradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.**  

  

We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.


You will be joining a high-growth, highly ambitious startup with an experienced founding team, whose motivation is building a more sustainable world using biology. We are backed by some of the most well known investors and industry veterans. Joining us now means you will be getting in on the ground floor; you will have a significant impact on how we shape the company, and success will mean an outsized reward.
