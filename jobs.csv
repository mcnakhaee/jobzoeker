We are looking for a motivated postdoctoral researcher with an interest and expertise in building computational models of body representation, technological augmentation, and embodiment. The goal of the project is to uncover the neurocognitive principles underlying the embodiment of finger-extending exoskeletons. To what extent do internal representations of the body and technology (e.g. exoskeletal fingers) fuse into a single representation? To make headway on answering this fundamental question, we will use a variety of neuroscientific approaches (behaviour and M/EEG) and analytical tools (computational modelling, machine learning).
  
  

**You will be part of the NOW VIDI Grant ’Human 2.0:** A neurocognitive framework for upgrading the body’. As a postdoctoral researcher, you will design novel behavioural and neuroimaging paradigms (EEG) to measure internal representations of the body and tools (specifically, finger-extending exoskeletons), as well as their fusion. In this project, we endeavour to understand the fusion process at a neurocomputational level. You will apply Bayesian modelling to behavioural data to characterise the somatosensory and multisensory transformations underlying fusion. You will then use machine learning approaches to identify neural signatures of their implementation in EEG signals. The overall goal of these experiments is to gain a better understanding of the embodiment of technology at a computational and neural level. There will be close collaboration with other members of the team, including colleagues throughout the Donders Institute. Project management and mentoring (MSc and BSc) will also be part of your responsibilities.

***Passionate about the scientific analysis of Cultural Heritage? Join us in building the next generation X-ray instrument for art and archaeology!***


Job description


The most advanced X-ray based techniques are availble at synchrotron radiation sources, such as the ESRF in Grenoble or DESY in Hamburg. Access to these extremely bright sources is limited, and Dutch researchers are in a disadvantageous position as the Netherlands are not directly involved in any of these centres of research. The Smart\*Light project (https://interregvlaned.eu/en/smart-light-2-0/) aims to make advanced X-ray analysis techniques available in the Netherlands. Several institutes in The Netherlands (TU Delft, TU Eindhoven, DIFFER) and Flanders (UAntwerpen, UGent) collaborate to develop a compact instrument that comprises an intense and energy-tunable X-ray source, X-ray optics and detectors. The source is based on the Inverse Compton Effect, where visible laser light, scattered by a relativistic electron beam, is promoted into the X-ray range, yielding a brilliant, coherent X-ray beam with a narrow bandwidth.



Your main task will be to build and commission the experimental endstation of Smart\*light. This endstation is meant for a characterisation of the beam and proof of principle experiments with a focus on cultural heritage objects (art objects or archaeological objects). This involves testing different components in the laboratory with X-ray tubes, verify their integration into the control software, determine spectroscopic figures of merit, optimize the instrument and demonstrate its capabilities in the first experiments. Based on the early experiments you will be involved in the planning of future Smart\*Light upgrades, especially regarding optics and beam shaping.



This work will be done within the team of the Alfeld Lab at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering of the Delft University of Technology. The Department of Materials Science is a diverse institution, working in small laboratories, headed by independent PIs on a range of topics, including optimising steel microstructure, corrosion, recycling and the investigation of cultural heritage. The Alfeld Lab is working on the multi-modal investigation of cultural heritage, with a special focus on X-ray investigations and the development of new instruments and data evaluation approaches.



You will work with the PI of the group, M. Alfeld, on the Smart\*Light endstation in the lab in Delft and with the team of the TU/e on the installation of the endstation in Eindhoven. It is possible to supervise Master students during the project and to pursue independent research endavours related to spectroscopy and/or cultural heritage.


Requirements


* You have experience in the operation and configuration of X-ray instruments for spectrometry, diffraction, imaging or similar techniques.
* You need to have a PhD in science (preferrably physics or chemistry) or engineering (materials science).
* You can work independently in an interdisciplinary environment with multiple stakeholders.
* You have at least moderate programming skills in python or the readiness to acquire these during the project.
* You have a good command of the English language, as you will be working in an international environment, and preferably of Dutch.
* You do not need to have worked with cultural heritage before, but it is a definite bonus.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



From 1 September next, a salary increase of 3.7% applies due to a Collective Agreement amendment, followed by an additional 1% increase on 1 January 2025. In addition, most employees employed on 1 September 2024 will receive a one-off payment of €300 gross based on full-time employment.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.


TU Delft (Delft University of Technology)


Delft University of Technology is built on strong foundations. As creators of the world-famous Dutch waterworks and pioneers in biotech, TU Delft is a top international university combining science, engineering and design. It delivers world class results in education, research and innovation to address challenges in the areas of energy, climate, mobility, health and digital society. For generations, our engineers have proven to be entrepreneurial problem-solvers, both in business and in a social context.



At TU Delft we embrace diversity as one of our core values and we actively engage to be a university where you feel at home and can flourish. We value different perspectives and qualities. We believe this makes our work more innovative, the TU Delft community more vibrant and the world more just. Together, we imagine, invent and create solutions using technology to have a positive impact on a global scale. That is why we invite you to apply. Your application will receive fair consideration.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for a:  

  

**Postdoc on Causal Machine Learning for Spatio-temporal Datasets**


The Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) is looking for an excellent Postdoc researcher (1.0 FTE) with a background in Computer Science (or a closely related field) to join a project focused on developing an advanced machine learning framework for spatio-temporal datasets. The position is for 4 years and is partially funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) through the Aspasia premium awarded to dr. Mitra Baratchi for her research on machine learning for spatio-temporal data. The successful applicant will be embedded in the Spatio-temporal data Analysis and Reasoning (STAR) and the Automated Design of Algorithms (ADA) research groups and collaborate with researchers at the Natural Computing (NACO) and the Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) Research Groups. Moreover, there are plenty of opportunities for interaction and collaboration with other groups at the institute and internationally.  

  

The research project is broadly focused on automated intervention design. An intervention is any external interference in an ongoing process that is performed to achieve a particular outcome. Being able to answer interventional questions automatically will help decision-makers solve complex challenges (i.e., reducing methane emissions or reducing the infection rate during a pandemic). Most machine learning algorithms designed for spatio-temporal data do not allow assessing the impact of interventions without capturing causal links. At the same time, configuring causal machine learning algorithms is extremely difficult, being an unsupervised learning task. In this project, we aim to design algorithmic solutions (e.g., new Automated Machine Learning approaches) for automatic and scalable assessment of interventions based on observational spatio-temporal datasets generated by modern sensing technologies (e.g., IoT sensors, mobile devices, Earth observations).

 **Key Responsibilities**


Within this position, it is expected that you will:

* conduct research within the scope of the project leading to peer-reviewed publications in journals and conference proceedings;
* collaborate closely with dr. Elena Raponi (the Natural Computing Group) and dr. Saber Salehkaleybar (the Explanatory Data Analysis Group) at LIACS;
* engage in teaching activities of the STAR Research Group and supervision of BSc and MSc students;

 **Selection Criteria**


We are looking for a candidate with expertise or experience with one or more of the following topics: machine learning for spatio-temporal data, causal machine learning (casual discovery and causal inference), and automated machine learning.

* holding (or close to acquiring) a PhD degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence or a closely related field;
* strong research vision and an academic mindset;
* strong publication record;
* being able to collaborate with scientific peers inside and outside your own research area;
* strong programming skills in Python or other programming languages;
* excellent proficiency and communication skills in English;

Netflix is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with 278 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

 **The Role**


Our mission at Netflix is to connect global stories with global audiences. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.


Recently, Netflix has expanded its entertainment offering to include Live content, like The Roast of Tom Brady Comedy Special, the SAG Awards ceremony, and The Netflix Slam tennis match. Our scope will grow to include premium live entertainment with our growing Live content catalogue, including WWE, NFL, and more.


Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips. This is made possible because Netflix UI is a thriving learning machine where Artwork & Video assets are personalized via reinforcement learning.

* Spearhead the creation of new metrics that impact decision-making
* Collaborate with Data Scientists & Data Engineers to source data from new systems and strengthen our foundational data models
* Become a regional expert on all things Studio Data Science & Engineering, helping educate and connect regional offices to existing data solutions

**You are…**

* A strong communicator who can develop and deepen strong relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders. You have experience partnering closely with executive leadership, with a proven track record of influencing strategic decisions through data.
* Comfortable with ambiguity; able to thrive with minimal oversight and process. You connect the dots across business needs and independently drive projects forward.
* A senior analytics professional with extensive experience across data wrangling, analysis, reporting, and visualization.
* An expert in a data-oriented programming language (e.g. SQL, Python, R, Scala, etc.) and intuitive dashboard/visualization design (e.g. Tableau)
* Proficient in ETL and data warehousing best practices and core statistics concepts (e.g. hypothesis testing)
* Adept at working across different cultures on a globally-distributed team, with core working hours in the Central European and GMT time zones

You will have the opportunity to impact the business in a meaningful way, working alongside smart people who love to solve hard problems, and who not only expect but also foster high performance.

The strength of TU/e’s IT landscape is their key to success and, hence, so are you as being an essential contributor to that landscape. These creative minds expect you to offer them a solution for tomorrow that doesn’t exist today. Together we are building the high performance backbone that this epicenter of science and technology demands. Are you driven by taking ownership and do you have an entrepreneurial mindset? We like to get in touch with you!  

  

**About Library and Information Services (LIS)**  

The service department Library and Information Services (LIS) service is responsible for the entire demand - supply chain in the fields of information management, IT and library services. In consultation with stakeholders, requirements are collected, prioritized and aligned. The service department consists of six Product Areas: Library and Open Science, Research, Education, Corporate, Data & Insights and Platforms. Product Area Research is looking to strengthen their Research IT team with a consultant for the department Mathematics and computer science.  

  

**About the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science**  

With over 110 (assistant, associate and full) professors, almost 300 PhD and EngD students, about 1500 Bachelor students and 1000 Master students, the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) is the largest department of the TU/e. By performing top-level fundamental and applied research, and maintaining strong ties with industry, M&CS aims to contribute to science and innovation in and beyond the region.  

The department’s relationship with the high-tech industry in the Brainport region means that interested staff and students can contribute directly to the development of technological innovations with real-world relevance. Several successful spin-offs have originated from the department and our staff participates in many national and international research consortia.  

  

**The postion**  

As a research IT consultant, you work in collaboration with researchers to develop fit-for-purpose, sustainable IT solutions. In addition, you provide (proactive) advice on how to translate functional IT requirements to technical products, services and workflows. You work in proximity of the department and its IT landscape, and have a pioneering role in setting up innovative (specific) solutions. You are part of a multidisciplinary team in which you share and learn from each other’s knowledge and expertise. This enables you to facilitate researchers at TU/e in conducting their research. You work for a department which fosters multidisciplinary research requiring highly specialized computational methods. With your broad range of interests and ability to oversee the complex landscape of interests and challenges, you facilitate the needs of research, so that scientists can focus on their most innovative work. You will also have the opportunity to build up an extensive network and to specialize in relevant research areas.


How this looks like in practice? Read the following section:  

  

**A typical week of a Research IT consultant at M&CS:**  

On Monday, you start the week together with the departmental IT support unit (“The Hub”) and review the current developments and your activities at M&CS. Together, you align on priorities and determine tactics for the best approach. In the afternoon, you visit a researcher who wants to scale up their computational jobs, by parallelizing the script to compute efficiently on the available resources. You advise them on what resources could be suitable for this use case and optionally get them in contact with expert support on this topic. At the same time, you notice you receive this type of question quite often, so you coordinate with the back-office to make sure we can support this type of request long-term.


On Tuesday, you work out a plan to facilitate in the IT requirements for a new Computer Science lab at the department, in alignment with the TU/e policies and frameworks for deploying IT. As development of this lab


might be interesting for the whole department, you prepare an agenda item for the department's IT committee. As you work in the same room with your fellow consultants in the afternoon, you can easily count on their help on how to approach this.


On Wednesday, you work at home and focus on developing and testing an IDE platform for specific applications that are needed for the Machine Learning group. You maintain a close feedback loop with the users and make agreements on structural support of the prototype. You inform your colleagues as they might also be interested in such a platform for their customers.


On Thursday, you meet the board during your regular check-in moment to report on the progress of their ‘research IT’. You have prepared in advance by checking in with the users and their experience and by analyzing available user data. For instance, you know that their VM facility is running out of capacity, so you advise them in policy-making to distribute the resources more efficiently. In the afternoon, you have a strategic meeting with your fellow consultants on how you want to develop as a team and the services you're offering.


On Friday, you took a seminar in the morning to spike up your research data management knowledge, and this comes in handy as you received a request to consult on a data management workflow for a research group using Git and other storage platforms. You have a call with the Data Steward to work out the details and you contribute to the technical aspects of the workflow.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* You have a minimum education of a Master’s degree or PhD degree, preferably with a background in Computer Science, Data Science or any related field;
* Several years of experience with conducting research, and you are able to effectively communicate with scientific staff;
* You are organizationally sensitive; you initiate and maintain relevant relationships with customers, (key) user groups, and suppliers;
* You identify the wishes and needs of our researchers, to proactively provide fit-for-purpose, IT solutions, and at the same time make proposals for sustainable innovation implementation based on demand trends;
* You are a pleasant collaboration partner for both scientists and the IT back office, thereby mediating between organization and innovation;
* You initiate action to innovate existing products and services, based on the interest of the department you represent;
* You have experience with one or more of the following techniques: Remote computing (cloud and / or on premise), Research Data Management and processing, Software Engineering, Git and / or code repository management, Software Licensing, AI related topics, Internet of Things, Infrastructural Architecture;
* Experience with scripting and automating workflows, in particular in Linux OS, is a bonus.


If you are concerned that you don’t meet all the requirements sufficiently, but the job does excite you, then be sure to respond, we would love to look at your profile.


**Conditions of employment**

How does the medieval body of texts known as 'canon law' reflect social and moral ideas? With a combination of AI and an advanced dataset, can we reveal patterns in the transmission and alteration of these ideas over time? Join the SOLEMNE project as a research assistant to explore these questions and more.
  
  

The medieval body of texts known as 'canon law' not only regulates strictly religious or ecclesiastical issues but also communicates social and moral ideas about the inner life of society. With an advanced dataset and novel AI techniques, it is possible to chart how such ideas are transmitted, appropriated, altered, and promoted in canonical collections. As a research assistant you will contribute to this study by expanding its data entry and training AI models.
  
  

This one-year position is part of the project 'The Social Life of Early Medieval Normative Texts' (SOLEMNE), funded through an ERC Consolidator Grant awarded to Dr Sven Meeder. A fuller description of the project can be found here. The SOLEMNE project aims to describe and contextualise the spread of social norms as articulated through specific combinations of canons in a bottom-up approach starting from the vast corpus of manuscript witnesses of canonical collections in every shape and form (4th-12th centuries). A dynamic dataset forms an essential element of the project, combined with an innovative digital tool that allows for queries of shared content in canonical collections or manuscripts and of levels of affinity based on combinations of authoritative statements.
  
  

In close collaboration with the project's postdoctoral researcher, associated data scientists, and development team, you will (i) contribute to the design of the database to store the information regarding original medieval manuscripts preserving individual canons and entire canonical collections, and scholarly editions of these texts, (ii) play a key role in training handwritten text recognition (HTR) models using eScriptorium software as well as AI-driven models for correction and normalisation of the transcription, (iii) populate the database with the data gathered from the original documents and printed reference works, (iv) contribute to the wider communication of the project's results, including materials intended for a general audience, and (v) cooperate closely with all of SOLEMNE’s subprojects.

-------------------


The Department of Industrial Design of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), in cooperation with Philips Clinical Informatics is offering two fully funded 2-year positions to master graduates leading to the award of an EngD (Engineering Doctorate) degree in Designing Human-System Interaction.


**Societal urgency**


Access to high quality healthcare is under increasing pressure. Patient volumes are rising due to an aging population, and the amount of data from scans and image interpretation is increasing at a steeper pace than radiologists and pathologists can handle. Radiology leaders have raised alarm that labor shortages are leading to longer wait times and delays in treatment for patients. Never has there been a bigger need to relieve the pressure from staff. But how exactly do we make that happen?


**The challenge**


Adoption of radiology and pathology solutions is increasingly driven by the extent to which solutions “naturally” fit into clinical workflows and enable radiologists and pathologists to deliver quality at speed. This requires not only high-quality medical data and cutting-edge AI models. More so, clinical acceptance and adoption depends on solutions that are designed with a clear understanding of clinical workflows and usage patterns, and with the requirements that different clinical experts have on their tooling. Beyond functional requirements, successful clinical adoption needs highly intuitive solutions, seamless workflow integration (speed), and a great user experience. In sum, we face the overarching challenge of how to integrate AI-based clinical decision-making tools into clinical practice that is characterized by fast-paced, high-stakes decision-making informed by deep domain knowledge and year-long expertise.


Prototypes that are highly realistic in the eyes of the clinical user have shown to be an important “vehicle” to enable rapid co-creation with clinicians. It enables them to give meaningful clinician-centered direction to development complex technical tools. Are you ready to iteratively create such prototypes and shape them together with experts in the field?


**You are part of a learning community**


You will be strongly embedded in and work closely with a highly dynamic community with experts from different disciplines including designers, researchers, engineers, clinical specialists and business:


* You will work “in-tandem” with your fellow EngD team member. You learn from each other by bouncing-off ideas and taking turns at different steps in the design process.
* You will immerse yourself in the Philips Clinical Informatics business context working closely with the design teams on the latest technology developments in radiology and digital pathology, in close collaboration with hospitals and clinical end-users where the impact is made.
* The EngD program offers a personalized learning experience through a mix of courses, coaching and hands-on learning by doing.
* You will be surrounded by a team of fellow EngDs and PhDs that focus on human-AI collaboration in the healthcare domain.


**The two positions**


**EngD position 1 – The medical data visualization & AI designer**

Design creation skills


* Strong conceptual design skills (translating user insights into concepts pushing the boundaries of the status quo)
* Affinity with UI, visual design skills, wireframes and clickable prototypes (e.g., Figma)
* Data visualization (next gen medical data & AI visualization)
* Interest in and understanding of AI (i.e., integration of AI in user journeys)
* Eye for detail and quality


Design research skills


* Enjoy experimentation with iterations based on user feedback and contextual insights
* Intermediate knowledge of user research methods (e.g., interviews, setting up and running small hands-on user tests with clinical end users, inquiries with stakeholders)


Soft skills


* Strong collaborator with multi-disciplinary team members and industry stakeholders
* Curious to know more about the healthcare domain and in obtaining a deep understanding of clinical end users in their daily work

Requirements


* A Masters degree in an industrial design or creative software development related discipline (e.g., Industrial Design with technical focus, Computer Science or Software Engineering with design affinity). Masters degree needs to be obtained before the prospective starting date of this position: September/ October 2024.


Technical skills

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

In the Geometric Learning and Differential Geometry Group (GLDG) within the Centre for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications (CASA) we invent, apply, and build new theory and methods in geometric AI for automated medical and industrial image analysis. The Geometric Deep learning methods developed in GLDG bridge the gap in image processing between machine learning and traditional PDE/geometry-based methods.


The focus in the group GLDG supported by VICI project “Geometric Learning for Image Analysis” (R. Duits) is on PDE-based equivariant neural networks aiming for impact on industry and society. This requires close interplay between mathematical theory and practical requirements. With implementation running parallel to theoretical development, we ensure that our geometric learning is both well-founded in profound new mathematics and relevant for practical applications.

**We’re hiring a Cloud Engineer (AWS) to join the Smart Sorting Platform Team!**

###### **Description**


Prime Vision’s Intelligence department is the backbone of most systems delivered to our customers. By handling sorting center and equipment definitions, orchestrating coding flows, executing and retrieving OCR requests, and communicating with customer backend systems locally and in the cloud, the Intelligence department has first-hand production experience in the postal and parcel domain. With the most experienced software engineers in the company, our sorting system helps our customers simplify and centralize their sorting process while guaranteeing high throughput in the cloud. We need a talented engineer passionate about evolving cloud technologies who can pick up AWS skills and backend TypeScript programming to join our team and drive our mission-critical platform forward.

###### **Your job**


As a Cloud Engineer (AWS) Engineer, you will be pivotal in making our AWS setup reliable, repeatable, and highly performant. You will be designing and implementing observability practices to increase fault tolerance in a distributed system, and you will learn to address millions of requests in a Serverless Lambda architecture. You will collaborate closely with the Smart Data Manager to implement efficient business rules. Further, you will discuss with the Smart Analytics team how to make sense of the data post-sorting. The Smart Sorting Platform you will help professionalize is the workhorse that must respond with correct sorting decisions within milliseconds, allowing Prime Vision to then digest the data for analysis and come up with more optimized logistical processes at national scales.

**Specific Responsibilities**:

* Design and implement serverless applications using AWS services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, EFS, and S3. We will later make the system cloud-agnostic.
* Develop and integrate advanced logic into our sorting processes to improve efficiency and accuracy.
* Build unit and integration tests for added logic that you build.
* Build and update CDK stacks for parts of the platform for testing and deployment purposes.
* Optimize and enhance existing sorting flows to ensure robustness and high performance.
* Ensure best practices in security, performance, and reliability are followed throughout the development process.
* Troubleshoot and resolve API-related issues promptly.
* Document designs, processes, and procedures to support ongoing development and maintenance.

**What we offer**


We offer a full-time position in an informal and professional working environment with a lot of room for personal development and many extras:

* First-hand access to customer challenges and a real possibility to positively impact them in their sorting processes.
* A product development team with a pivotal position within the department, with an overseeing Product Owner and clear goals for 2 customers for 2024-2026.
* Opportunities to learn from the most experienced software engineers in the company.
* An open and inclusive workspace with colleagues from more than 20 different nationalities.
* A globally oriented company with an equally global client base.
* A full range of digital tools will be at your disposal.
* Competitive salary.
* Company laptop and mobile phone of choice.
* Extra perks such as snacks and excellent coffee every day in our cozy Grand Café.
* Training sessions by a personal trainer in our in-house gym.
* The possibility to work flexible hours.
* A profit-sharing scheme for all employees.
* The option to purchase additional vacation days on top of the 25 standard holiday allowance.

###### **Your profile**

* Proven experience as Cloud Engineer in any cloud provider. Experience with AWS and Serverless technologies is a big plus (Lambda, DynamocDB, EFS, S3, EventBridge, Kinesis, etc).
* Familiarity and expertise in event-driven architectures. Experience with SNS is a plus.
* Strong programming skills in TypeScript for backend systems. If not previous experience, the candidate should have experience with JavaScript or Python. Experience with NoSQL databases is a plus.
* Familiarity/willingness to learn CDK for deployment and infrastructure scripts.
* Familiarity with other cloud platforms (Azure, GCP) is a plus.

###### **Nice to have qualifications:**

* Knowledge of CICD best practices applicable to enterprises (DTAP environments, automatic quality gates, etc).

###### **Particularities**


In the context of corporate responsibility, Prime Vision as a company is particularly open to applications from people with a disability.

###### **Convinced this job fits you?**


If you are excited about making an already fast AWS platform even faster and want to develop yourself in the cloud and logistics domain, we would love to receive your resume and motivation letter or -video!


The application process will consist of 2 interviews and a Big Five personality test. We look forward to hearing from you.

Parent-infant physical closeness (PIPC) sharply decreases over the first months in Western families, while studies show that PIPC is important for healthy child development and potentially also for maternal wellbeing. PIPC may hence offer unique opportunities to support both child development and new parents’ wellbeing. However, large gaps in knowledge on fathers, causal associations, underlying mechanisms, and long-term relations preclude further developments. Will you help us with further research?***  

  

This 4-year project is financed by NWO and focused on early parenthood and infancy and will be lead by Prof Dr. Carolina de Weerth (Developmental Psychobiology Lab).  

  

Our multidisciplinary team will fill these gaps with sophisticated intervention, experimental, and longitudinal studies on daily life PIPC: baby carrying, skin-to-skin contact, and room sharing. We will determine whether, to what extent, and through what mechanisms easily accessible avenues for increasing PIPC can lead to improved maternal, paternal, and child mental and physical health, both concurrently as well as later in childhood and adolescence.  

  

The project includes collaborators from Erasmus University Rotterdam, Utrecht University, and University of Trento. You will be part of a team consisting of senior researchers, a PhD student, a student assistant, as well as perinatal professionals and parents. You will be affiliated to the Donders Institute for Brain Cognition and Behaviour and the Baby & Child Research Center.  

  

We offer a challenging position in an innovative project within a team of dedicated colleagues. Our collaboration is characterized by creativity, collegiality, team work, and responsibility. You will be part of a dynamic, enthusiastic, collaborative, and ambitious research group specialized in early life, the developmental psychobiology lab.

Job description


Autonomous vehicles have been shown to underperform when deployed on conditions that differ substantially from the training conditions, so-called domain gaps. These domain gaps can include deployment in different regions, weather or using different sensors. Numerous domain adaptation methods have been proposed to bridge these domain gaps and let the model operate well on the target data. In this project we seek to find an intermediate representation for data coming from varied sources. By bringing new data into this representation, we overcome domain gaps and are able to train models that are robust to different conditions, also referred to as foundation models. While foundation models have achieved widespread success on images and text, currently none exist for radar data, making this a promising research direction. These foundation models will bring superior performance and allow us to utilize data from varied sources, thus reducing the data collection and labeling costs.



The Intelligent Vehicles section at TU Delft, the Netherlands, invites applications for a fully funded two-year (up to 30 months) Post-Doctoral research position in the area of foundation models for autonomous vehicles. This position is part of the EU Horizon project Cynergie4MIE and in collaboration with the chip company NXP. While the exact task (detection, segmentation) is flexible, it should make use of radar sensors, potentially fused with other sensors. Your results will be published in top tier conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICRA and NeurIPS. For your work you will have access to the compute resources of TU Delft, ranging from personal machines, to shared GPU servers, the Delft AI Cluster that is shared across departments, as well as DelftBlue, which is one of the top 250 supercomputers in the world. Your main supervisor will be Dr. Holger Caesar, creator of the nuScenes dataset and co-author of the PointPillars method for lidar-based object detection. You will receive hands-on mentoring for your career development and help with applying for future research grants, to kick-start your continued academic career.


Requirements


* We are seeking Post-Doc applicants with an interest in performing cutting edge research in an active and exciting research area.
* Prospective applicants should have a strong academic record with a solid background in sensor processing (vision/radar/lidar, sensor fusion) and Machine Learning (Deep Learning, domain adaptation, foundation models).
* Good programming skills (Python/Matlab) and knowledge of deep-learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch) are expected.
* A certain affinity towards turning complex concepts into real-world practice (i.e. vehicle demonstrator) is desired.
* The successful candidate is expected to be able to act independently as well as to collaborate effectively with members of a larger team and supervise Master and PhD students. Good English skills are required.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



From 1 September next, a salary increase of 3.7% applies due to a Collective Agreement amendment, followed by an additional 1% increase on 1 January 2025. In addition, most employees employed on 1 September 2024 will receive a one-off payment of €300 gross based on full-time employment.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

Job description


Autonomous vehicles have come a long way from initial public testing with safety drivers to fully driverless deployments in multiple cities across the world. However, to further improve these vehicles, they need to be trained from ever growing data sources collected by their fleets. Due to the vast cost of storing and processing this data, car manufacturers face the problem that they can only store a fraction of it (storing 1h of data costs about $5000 per year). Therefore new paradigms are needed to reduce the storage and processing cost.



Federated learning is such a novel paradigm that revolutionizes how Machine Learning systems are trained. Rather than storing all data on a central server and training there, federated learning allows us to learn in a distributed way. In the case of autonomous vehicles, this means that every vehicle can perform training steps while the system is idle, thereby saving energy and bandwidth. Furthermore, federated learning is much less privacy-sensitive, since sensor data of faces does not need to be transferred to the cloud.



The Intelligent Vehicles section at TU Delft, the Netherlands, invites applications for a fully funded two-year (up to 30 months) Post-Doctoral research position in the area of federated learning for autonomous vehicles. This position is part of the EU Horizon project Cynergie4MIE and in collaboration with the chip company NXP. You will be one of the first to train modern perception and/or prediction (a.k.a. motion forecasting) algorithms in a federated learning setup and provide an analysis of the pros and cons of this approach. While the exact task (detection, segmentation, prediction) is flexible, it should make use of radar sensors, potentially fused with other sensors. Your results will be published in top tier conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICRA and NeurIPS. For your work you will have access to the compute resources of TU Delft, ranging from personal machines, to shared GPU servers, the Delft AI Cluster that is shared across departments, as well as DelftBlue, which is one of the top 250 supercomputers in the world. Your main supervisor will be Dr. Holger Caesar, creator of the nuScenes dataset and co-author of the PointPillars method for lidar-based object detection. You will receive hands-on mentoring for your career development and help with applying for future research grants, to kick-start your continued academic career.


Requirements


* We are seeking Post-Doc applicants with an interest in performing cutting edge research in an active and exciting research area.
* Prospective applicants should have a strong academic record with a solid background in sensor processing (vision/radar/lidar, sensor fusion) and Machine Learning (Deep Learning, optionally federated learning).
* Good programming skills (Python/Matlab) and knowledge of deep-learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch) are expected.
* A certain affinity towards turning complex concepts into real-world practice (i.e. vehicle demonstrator) is desired.
* The successful candidate is expected to be able to act independently as well as to collaborate effectively with members of a larger team and supervise Master and PhD students.
* Good English skills are required.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



From 1 September next, a salary increase of 3.7% applies due to a Collective Agreement amendment, followed by an additional 1% increase on 1 January 2025. In addition, most employees employed on 1 September 2024 will receive a one-off payment of €300 gross based on full-time employment.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

Secure communications and networking have become a key cornerstone for the Internet enabling several trusted applications which we take for granted today. For example, services such as digital banking, connected transport, digital medical records, defence, governmental and of course data communications – would be challenging should the trust in modern communication systems be lost. As quantum technologies progress rapidly, the growing capabilities of quantum computers threatens the security and then the trust of current cryptographic technologies and protocols. Preventing this threat requires adoption of quantum safe cryptography in the form of post-quantum crypto (PQC) algorithms and protocols and/or using quantum key distribution (QKD). Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) has established an open access testbed for quantum safe communications where various QKD and PQC solutions are evaluated and tested. Various research activities at TU/e are developing network protocols and solutions for quantum safe communications, as well continuous and discrete variable QKD transmitters and receivers (based on electronic and photonic integration technology). At TU/e, QKD systems have been developed to run the required full signal processing chain in real-time at relatively high secret key rates. The testbed evaluates these QKD systems together with PQC for real-world applicable quantum safe communication solutions and investigates their integration with classical communication networks.

**Vision - Quantum Safe Communications Testbed in Eindhoven**  

Secure communications and networking have become a key cornerstone for the Internet enabling several trusted applications which we take for granted today. For example, services such as digital banking, connected transport, digital medical records, defence, governmental and of course data communications – would be challenging should the trust in modern communication systems be lost. As quantum technologies progress rapidly, the growing capabilities of quantum computers threatens the security and then the trust of current cryptographic technologies and protocols. Preventing this threat requires adoption of quantum safe cryptography in the form of post-quantum crypto (PQC) algorithms and protocols and/or using quantum key distribution (QKD). Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) has established an open access testbed for quantum safe communications where various QKD and PQC solutions are evaluated and tested. Various research activities at TU/e are developing network protocols and solutions for quantum safe communications, as well continuous and discrete variable QKD transmitters and receivers (based on electronic and photonic integration technology). At TU/e, QKD systems have been developed to run the required full signal processing chain in real-time at relatively high secret key rates. The testbed evaluates these QKD systems together with PQC for real-world applicable quantum safe communication solutions and investigates their integration with classical communication networks.
