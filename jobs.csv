**The Opportunity: Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst**


We are looking for an experienced Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst to take a lead role in transforming data into actionable insights that drive strategic decision\-making across the company. In this hands\-on role, you will design and deliver business\-critical dashboards and analytical reports that inform how we improve patient access and grow our business. As a senior individual contributor on our Data \& Analytics team, you’ll work alongside a Data Engineer and fellow Analysts within our Product \& Engineering organization. You will collaborate cross\-functionally with stakeholders in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial, and Product, becoming a go\-to expert for data insights.


**What You'll be Doing:**


In your first 3–6 months, you will hit the ground running by spearheading the creation of several high\-impact dashboards, including:

* Client Program Performance Dashboards – to monitor and visualize our patient programs' performance and identify opportunities to improve outcomes.
* Revenue Tracking Dashboards – to provide real\-time visibility into revenue streams and financial KPIs, helping steer commercial strategy.
* Patient Source Attribution Dashboards – to trace and illustrate how patients find our platform (using tools like Sankey diagrams for flow visualization), informing marketing and outreach efforts.

**This is the right opportunity for you if:**

* Design, build, and maintain interactive dashboards and reports in Tableau (and other BI tools) to track key metrics across the business. You will own end\-to\-end dashboard development – from gathering requirements to data modeling and visualization – ensuring stakeholders have self\-service access to up\-to\-date insights.
* Deliver actionable insights for growth: Analyze operational and marketing data (from MySQL/PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases, Airflow, Excel, etc.) to understand key performance drivers. Translate data into clear findings and recommendations that drive user acquisition, patient engagement, and sustainable business growth.
* Be the analytical partner for leadership: Serve as a point of contact for the leadership team on all things data. Provide in\-depth reporting, ad\-hoc analysis, and executive\-friendly dashboards that inform strategic decisions and highlight trends in business performance.
* Focus on data quality and accuracy: Work closely with our Data Engineer and product engineers to ensure we have reliable, well\-structured data. Help maintain and validate data models, databases and data pipelines so that reports are accurate and reflect the single source of truth. Identify any data gaps or integrity issues and collaborate on solutions.
* Drive performance improvements: Monitor key KPIs (such as program success metrics, funnel conversion rates, revenue metrics) and proactively identify operational bottlenecks or areas for improvement. Provide insight\-driven suggestions to optimize workflows, improve patient recruitment, or streamline processes.
* Cross\-functional collaboration: Partner with teams in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial and Product to understand their analytics needs. Support these stakeholders by building custom reports or exploratory analysis, and ensure they can leverage your dashboards for day\-to\-day decision making. For example, you might deep\-dive into marketing funnel data to advise the Growth team, or analyze operational turnaround times to assist the Operations team.
* Advanced analysis and data exploration: Use Python (with pandas, numpy, etc.) and SQL for deeper ad\-hoc analyses, data discovery, and data preparation. When questions go beyond existing reports, you’ll dig into raw data to uncover insights, validate hypotheses, and prepare datasets for further analysis.
* Mentorship and best practices: As a senior analyst, mentor and guide junior analysts on the team. Review their work, share knowledge of best practices in analytics, SQL querying, and visualization. Lead by example in documentation and reproducibility. You will also enable business users’ self\-service by training stakeholders on how to use established dashboards and reporting tools effectively.
* Shape data strategy: Contribute to our overall data strategy by identifying new metrics or analytics opportunities that can drive value. Advocate for a data\-driven mindset across the organization. You’ll play a key role in evolving our analytics capabilities (for instance, suggesting new BI features or improving reporting processes) to support a scaling, high\-growth environment.

**You Have:**

* Experience: 5\+ years in data analytics, business intelligence, or a similar role, with a track record of handling complex data projects and delivering insights to business stakeholders. Experience in a growth\-stage tech company or digital health environment is a plus.
* Strong proficiency in SQL (ability to write complex queries in MySQL/PostgreSQL). Hands\-on experience with data visualization tools, especially Tableau (or similar BI platforms), to create dynamic dashboards. Familiarity with NoSQL databases and tools like Airflow is beneficial. Advanced Excel skills for quick analysis and data prep.
* Experience using Python for data analysis tasks – e.g. data cleaning, exploration, and validation using libraries such as pandas or numpy. Must be comfortable scripting to manipulate data when needed.
* Present data in a clear and compelling way. Experience creating a variety of chart types and visuals – from standard bar/line charts to more advanced visuals like Sankey diagrams or funnel charts – to illustrate user flows and attribution. An eye for design and attention to detail in dashboards ensuring they are accurate, easy to interpret, and visually engaging.
* Analytical Mindset: Excellent analytical and problem\-solving skills. Capable of interpreting complex datasets, identifying trends and outliers, and connecting the dots between data and business outcomes. You approach problems with curiosity and a hypothesis\-driven mindset.
* Business Acumen: Strong understanding of business metrics and growth drivers. Ability to translate business questions from non\-technical stakeholders into analytical approaches, and then translate back findings into business terms. Experience working on metrics like revenue, conversion funnels, customer acquisition cost, etc., is highly valued.
* Exceptional communication skills in English (our company language). You can distill complex analyses into clear insights and narratives for different audiences. Comfortable presenting findings to senior leadership and guiding discussions on data.
* Collaboration: Proven ability to work cross\-functionally and build positive relationships with diverse teams — from operations managers to product designers. You’re a team player who can align data projects with the needs of multiple departments and manage stakeholder expectations.
* Leadership \& Mentorship: Demonstrated experience mentoring junior analysts or leading analytical projects. You enjoy helping others grow their skills and can influence without formal authority. You’re enthusiastic about sharing knowledge and establishing best practices for analytics within a team.
* Self\-Driven \& Organized: Thrives in a fast\-paced, high\-growth environment. Able to manage and prioritize multiple projects and requests, deliver on deadlines, and adapt to evolving business needs. You take ownership of your work and proactively seek out ways to add value.
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in a relevant field (e.g. Data Science, Statistics, Business, Computer Science, or similar) is preferred, or equivalent practical experience in data analysis roles.

**What we offer**

* Impactful work that helps patients gain access to potentially lifesaving treatments.

In this thesis, you will generate synthetic training data by transforming low\-poly 3D models of hands and feet into photorealistic images with labeled key points. Using techniques like pix2pix GANs, you’ll explore and optimize the process to create a diverse and enriched dataset, enhancing pose estimation models for AI\-driven Parkinson’s symptom analysis.**

**Areas of Interest:** Generative AI, Controllable Image Generation, Few\-shot Learning


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


The examination of Parkinson’s symptoms is highly labor\-intensive, as it requires multiple trained neurologists to thoroughly analyze hand and leg movements. A group of hospitals aims to extend Parkinson’s treatment in the Netherlands to regions where such care is currently unavailable due to a shortage of trained neurologists. To achieve this, they want to make a pre\-selection through the help of AI on a smartphone. Part of the solution is a pose estimation model to track hand and foot movements. However, the current dataset for training the model is neither large nor diverse enough. The goal is to enrich the dataset with highly varied data while minimizing the need for manual effort.


Important features for detecting hands and feet could be better balanced by enriching the training dataset with synthetic data. To prevent manual labeling of the training data, it would be ideal if the ground truth for tracking key points is synthesized along with the training images. By converting low\-poly 3D models with key point rigs into photorealistic images, a synthetic dataset of labeled training images could be generated. Your task will be to investigate how to transform low\-poly models into photorealistic images using AI.

**The Assignment**
------------------


You will create a training dataset consisting of low\-poly 3D body rigs, focusing on the hands and feet. Next, you will explore transforming these low\-poly models into photorealistic images using a pix2pix GAN model. You may also fine\-tune the model to optimize hyperparameters for generating the best results. Your findings will be documented in a thesis and presented during your thesis defense.

However, these systems present challenges, particularly with model agnostic explanations which are more approximations. This includes global and local explanations, with local ones possibly misleading due to their narrow focus. Effective testing is crucial to verify if explanations are sensible to experts, consistent across different outcomes, and to understand when they might change.**

**Areas of Interest:** Artificial Intelligence, Explainable AI


Explainable machine learning and artificial intelligence models have been used to justify a model’s decision\-making process. This added transparency aims to help improve user performance and understanding of the underlying model. However, in practice, explainable systems face many open questions and challenges.


Model agnostic explanations are more approximations. In general there are two kinds of explanations: global and local explanations. For the latter, there’s the possibility that the explanation is off, because it only looks at the local inference. It’s possible that for opposite inference, we get exactly the same explanations. To get proper explanations we’ll need to be able to test them. Are the explanations sensible to business experts and aren’t there any same explanations for opposite outcomes? And do we know when explanations will change?

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

We’re crafting a metric that measures how achievable AI\-generated advice is—for real people. Think of it as teaching AI common sense; for instance, you can’t just age a decade instantly. Your challenge: integrate advanced language models like GPT to gauge if a “what if” scenario is useful or just a tech fantasy. Join us in shaping a more sensible, user\-centric AI future.**

**Areas of Interest:** XAI/Explainable AI, LLMs/Large Language Models, ChatGPT, NLP/Natural Language Processing


Counterfactual explanations are considered an intuitive and user\-friendly form of explainable AI. A counterfactual explanation proposes minimal changes to the input data that would lead to a different model output. As an example, a bank could make use of a model to determine if a customer can get a loan or not. If a customer was denied a loan, a counterfactual explanation could tell them that, for instance, “if their savings were increased by 10\.000€, they could get the loan”.


However, counterfactual explanations are not aware of the semantics of the input features. It might be that the minimal change for a customer to get a loan is to “increase their age from 25 to 35 years old” which, from a human perspective, is evidently unfeasible in a short time span.

**The Assignment**
------------------


In this project, we would like you to design a new evaluation metric to automatically determine the practicality of counterfactuals, that is, how attainable a counterfactual explanation is (or if it is even humanly attainable). Since the determination of practicality involves semantic understanding of the input features, our idea would be to leverage GPT and/or other large language model\-based technologies to accomplish this.


A user study could be conducted initially following the methodology proposed by Spreitzer et al (1\) to evaluate the practicality of different state\-of\-the\-art counterfactual techniques. The user study can then be extended to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed metric compared to the human evaluations.

 What we offer
   

  

**About Us**
 We are Xomnia, the AI consulting company. We’re curious problem solvers who believe data will change the way we live, work and communicate. Being at the forefront of this revolutionary change in a sustainable, positive way is what drives us.
   

  

 We solve challenging data science and engineering projects, from start to finish. From developing an application for real\-time fraud detection on Google Cloud Platform, to setting up a customized recommender engine in an existing Microsoft Azure environment \- we develop and deploy tailor\-made data science solutions.
   

  

 Xomnia started in 2013 in one room in the heart of Amsterdam. These days we take up nearly two houses. But more than just a workspace, we're a community that values authenticity. Here, everyone is encouraged to be themselves, to learn, and to have fun in the process.
   

  

 Representing over 20 nationalities, our team values the unique cultural perspective that each individual brings to the table. Moreover, with the Dutch tech sector seeing a female representation around 11%, we are proud that over 30% of our workforce is female. Nevertheless, we recognize that there is more to be done, and we continue working to overcome barriers that still exist.
   

  

 We encourage all candidates to apply, and we don’t discriminate based on race, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age. However, a reality that we face is that many of our clients prefer to communicate in Dutch, making Dutch proficiency essential for some roles. Additionally, while we wish that we could sponsor visas for everyone, there are instances when it is not feasible.
   

  

 If you're experienced, passionate, and align with our values, we want to hear from you.",Information Technology & Services,https://nl.linkedin.com/company/xomnia,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEMxcvPDbBSiQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1724141336408/xomnia_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=0v5TZXJBHiKRXgKL2iodt4MaQoB-A_OFbbEE8e8kKF0,,,,,,,,,,,,ai engineer,linkedin,en
