For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to preempt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

From our people who are caring, candid, and impact-driven to our business, which is innovative and rooted in science, we believe that being proudly unique, determined to be our best, and authentic is essential to fulfilling our purpose.
The role
Join our dynamic bioinformatics team at Genmab as a student data engineer, where you will play a crucial role in supporting our scientists by creating and managing sophisticated data architectures aligned with FAIR principles. In this position, you will focus on integrating real-world clinical and molecular data into graph database models to facilitate complex data analysis and enable innovative research methodologies.

This internship offers a unique opportunity to develop expertise in data engineering technologies, contribute to bioinformatics solutions, and directly impact our research in developing groundbreaking therapeutic strategies. Your work will support essential projects aimed at enhancing drug discovery and development processes, fostering your growth as a data scientist and making a meaningful impact in the field of biomedicine.*Project Background*
Translational research leverages real-world data sets to study how patients respond to cancer treatments. This research often involves integrating complex and non-standardized molecular and clinical data. Clinical datasets, designed to answer specific scientific questions, typically lack detailed data granularity, making exploration challenging. Understanding the clinical data model is crucial to selecting the appropriate variables for analysis.
This project proposes the use of graph databases to overcome these challenges by organizing data into a flexible, multidimensional structure that facilitates easier access and more intuitive querying. Graph databases, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, allow for the discovery of implicit relationships within the data that traditional table-based databases might miss. Through this initiative, we aim to develop and evaluate AI-driven querying techniques using natural language, enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets in translational research.
Responsibilities* Technology Exploration: Investigate various graph database technologies and their applicability to managing clinical data, assessing their strengths and limitations in this domain.
* Data Model Comparison: Compare and analyze the data structures of graph and relational databases to identify the most effective frameworks for clinical data.
* Pilot Database Development: Design and implement a prototype database focused on the standardization of clinical real-world data, ensuring it supports robust data integration and access.
* Natural Language Query Development: Create methods to enable querying of graph databases using natural language, employing advanced AI technologies to facilitate intuitive data interactions.
* Findings Presentation: Regularly present progress and insights during team meetings, ensuring clear communication of developments and challenges.
* Bonus Objective: Develop a user interface that enables easy querying, and effective visualization and presentation of results from the database.


Requirements* Education: You are a BSc/MSc student in bioinformatics, computational biology or a related field.
* Technical skills: Demonstrated strong technical skills, with substantial experience in Python programming. Familiarity with AWS is an added advantage.
* Soft skills: Comfortable with pioneering research and creative processes; scientific thinking and connecting that to technical requirements.


About You* You are passionate about our purpose and genuinely care about our mission to transform the lives of patients through innovative cancer treatment
* You bring rigor and excellence to all that you do. You are a fierce believer in our rooted-in-science approach to problem-solving
* You are a generous collaborator who can work in teams with diverse backgrounds
* You are determined to do and be your best and take pride in enabling the best work of others on the team
* You are not afraid to grapple with the unknown and be innovative
* You have experience working in a fast-growing, dynamic company (or a strong desire to)
* You work hard and are not afraid to have a little fun while you do so

Are you fascinated by sustainability issues and do you have experience and affinity with researching the effects of land use on climate? Then we are looking for you!***  

  

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research into monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).  

  

While the team’s main focus is on forests we also conduct research into the role of land use and forest management in greenhouse gas emissions and removals in a broader context involving the whole LULUCF sector, including other land uses. Team members are responsible for the compilation of the national greenhouse gas inventory for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. For this we develop and work with geographically explicit instruments (such as models and monitoring) that can be used to determine the effects of the management or change in land use of forests, cropland, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other land. We closely collaborate with other experts on land use and soil at Wageningen Environmental Research and external research institutes to bring together all required information for the LULUCF monitoring.  

  

We use our knowledge and tools to draw up the international (Climate Convention, Paris Agreement, EU) and national (Climate and Energy Outlook) reports of greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. With our science-based expertise we also support the development and evaluation of climate policy of the Dutch government and European Commission. For instance, we currently support the European Commission in drafting the methodologies for certification of carbon removals in forests, wetlands and agricultural soils (carbon farming).  

  

**Your duties and responsibilities:**  

As LULUCF researcher you will contribute to further improving our methodologies for calculating carbon stock changes towards higher Tier levels according to the IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. This will involve the compilation and collection of new emission factors for carbon stock changes in living biomass, dead organic matter or soils and/or emissions of methane or nitrous oxide due to land use or land use change.  

  

Depending on your expertise you will be responsible for the improvements for several land use categories covered by the LULUCF sector and/or the further development of spatially explicit approaches. You also contribute to the acquisition of new externally funded projects.  

  

**You will work here**  

You will be placed in the team SFE of WENR, based at the Wageningen Campus of Wageningen University and Research, but you will also collaborate intensively with colleagues in other teams at WENR as well as with researchers in other research institutes in the Netherlands and internationally.  

  

You will be working in an enthusiastic team of about 24 colleagues working on options for conservation, restoration, development and sustainable use of trees and forests from an ecological perspective. We focus on the way in which policy, management and climate affect ecological processes and what their consequences are for climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and restoration, delivery of ecosystem services and other specific policy goals.

Read the 5 reasons why your future colleagues enjoy working at WUR and watch the video below to get an idea of our green campus!

**Omschrijving**
----------------


The Soil Physics and Land Management chair group at Wageningen University and Research is seeking a postdoc researcher in hydrological modelling who will be responsible for the numerical modelling work in project RESTARTIN: “Restructuring and enhancing strategies with a transformative approach for integrated water disaster management in India and the Netherlands”. This work will involve not only the modelling itself, but also the use of high-resolution satellite imagery to assess vegetation water conditions for calibration, the design of land-use change scenarios (eventually with modelling), and interactions with stakeholders and socioeconomic researchers to translate potential adaptation options into practice.  

Your duties and responsibilities include:

+ apply a surface and groundwater model to several regions in the Netherlands (Limburg, Brabant and Holland);
+ assess climate change scenarios and design compatible land-use scenarios;
+ assess the impact of climate change on flood and drought conditions;
+ test potential adaptation options in coordination with stakeholders;
+ some involvement in related educational activities is possible.
**You will work here**  

You will work in project RESTARTIN, jointly funded by NWO and DST-India. Most of the work will be developed within the Soil Physics and Land Management chair group in WUR. But it will be closely coordinated with researchers at IHE-Delft working on detailed risk assessment and socioeconomic analysis. It will also be closely linked with similar activities being performed by Indian researchers in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra. Some travelling to India is therefore expected.


The intended starting date of this position is 1 September 2024.

**Functie-eisen**
-----------------


You hold a PhD degree in hydro(geo)logy, environmental sciences or equivalent. You also possess:

+ strong and broad conceptual and methodological knowledge of hydrology at the soil-water-plant and watershed scales, including relevant numerical models (e.g., HEC-HMS/RAS, SWMM, HBV, SWAT, SHE, VIC, MODFLOW, CATHY, HGS, FEFLOW, DSSAT, etc.), and model calibration/validation techniques;
+ in-depth experience with GIS packages (e.g., ArcGIS, Qgis) and advanced data analysis techniques;
+ in-depth experience with scripting in R, MATLAB, Python, FORTRAN, etc.;
+ experience in scientific writing, conducting research, and a publication record in hydrology;
+ ability to work independently and to take ownership of the assigned tasks, including making independent decisions on implementation details.

We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”



Unique to this job  

We are an international, dynamic, highly motivated team of scientists at different stages of our careers with a strong drive to push research for the benefit of Public Health. We combine expertise in immunology, virology, and bioinformatics and believe in the strength of collaboration and working together as a team.

**Job Description:**

**IT Internship: GenAI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision**
==============================================================


Are you a student looking to launch your Information Technology career? If so, then UPS is the place for you! We will give you the opportunity to work on practical business problem in the Logistic industry using Digitization techniques and Artificial Intelligence.


UPS is a leader in Information Technology. If you are a highly motivated student working on a degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, Mathematics, Engineering, Business, Human Resources, Finance, or a related degree, then UPS is a great place for you to start your career.


Explore your next opportunity at a Global Fortune 500 organization. Envision innovative possibilities, experience our rewarding culture, and work with talented teams that help you excel every day. We know what it takes to lead UPS into tomorrow, – people with a unique combination of skills and passion. If you have the qualities and drive to lead yourself then this role will help you to cultivate your skills and take you to the next level. As a part of the internship, you will have opportunity to learn and develop the following business cases:

**Document Indexing (DOCIDX)**


Indexing scanned documents based on an embedded barcode of any type like CODE39, QR... is essential for any later processing, such as storage and retrieval, distribution to other departments or customer, and other back-office processing. We would like you to work on creating a reusable interface to index scanned documents in bulk, easily customizable for any environment and task.

**Package Type Detection (PKGDCT)**


UPS operates a large number of automated package-processing facilities. Not all packages processed have the perfect cube shape and size. We need to detect the shape of the packages (e.g., envelope, regular box, big size, irregular…) so that they are processed with the care required for each type, or even detect warning conditions like broken packages or liquid leaks.

**Job Description:**


As a computer vision scientist, you will review the current process flow the cases for image acquisition, either paper-based or digital documents for the case #1 and explore different options to capture package images from operational facilities to be later processed in case #2. For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to pre-empt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

**This position requires one or more of the following technical or business skills:**

* Proficiency in computer vision tools and algorithms.
* Strong mathematical skills to help collect, measure, organize and analyse data
* Knowledge of programming languages like SQL, Oracle, R, MATLAB, Java, and Python
* Technical proficiency regarding database design development, data models, techniques for data mining, and segmentation

Experience in reporting/creating dashboards with Power BI, Looker, programming (Javascript, XML, or ETL frameworks), databases, and working with Google Cloud Platform  
* 

  

**This position requires one or more of the following soft skills:**

* Effective communication
* Responsibility
* Accountability
* Adaptability
* Willingness/eagerness to learn.
* Independently
* Resiliency
* Problem-solving skills

**What is expected from you (and from the University)?**

* Data Privacy and Confidentiality, that will be ensured by signing the Non-Disclosure Agreement with UPS
* Full participation in all the project steps
* Take-up assignments and tasks and deliver them with quality and speed according to Agile project timeline
* Handover all deliverables (project documentation, software and algorithms developed) to UPS as Intellectual Property and not to be used outside the internship program
* At the end of the internship the intern will be given the opportunity to present results to the Europe IT management team (optional), UPS Mentor and University coach

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-------------------


Join us – we look forward to welcoming you to our Self-Organizing Soft Matter Research Group at Eindhoven University of Technology!


We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Researcher with a passion for quantitative microscopy and physical chemistry of self-assembling materials to join our team to image the behavior of ice-interactive biomaterials on ice with single-molecule resolution. The goal of your project is to develop and use state-of-the-art microscopy tools and quantitative image analysis approaches to discover the physical principles underpinning the activity of novel ice-interactive biomaterials and to tune their interaction with ice to modulate activity as desired.


Key Responsibilities:


* Conduct high-quality, curiosity-driven, original, and independent research focusing on quantitative imaging and super-resolution microscopy of self-assembling materials
* Collaborate with a multi-disciplinary and international team of researchers
* Present research findings at conferences and publish in top-tier scientific journals
* Mentor and support junior researchers in the lab


The formation and growth of ice during freezing, storage, and/or thawing of cryopreserved materials limits the potential of cryopreservation technology for the long-term storage of sensitive materials, such as cells, tissues, and organs. Our group aims to unravel how biological and engineered ice-interactive materials function so that we can create customized chemical cryoprotectants for biomedical and other applications. Recently, we reported sub-zero super-resolution microscopy experiments which allowed us to study for the first time the interfacial dynamics of ice-bound ice-binding proteins at the single molecule level (see PNAS publication for more information). In this project you will build upon these pioneering experiments. You will image the interaction with ice of a novel class of engineered ice-interactive materials at the single molecule level to advance our understanding of how their structure and properties impact their ability to modulate ice crystal formation and growth. In this exciting role, you will work in a vibrant and international research group aiming to advance molecular insight into the working mechanism of novel ice-interactive materials for biomedical applications.

Are you an ambitious bioinformatician with a solid background in omics data analysis and experience in the field of immunology and/or infectious disease research? Then this bioinformatician position is the job for you!



Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work.

Join us on our journey as Splunk Solution Engineer, and enjoy a culture of inclusiveness, disruption, and fun while selling smart and winning big.
What’s the role of a Solution Engineer at Splunk?* You will technically own, discover, position, prove and deliver the key technical elements of a sales cycle to achieve a ‘technical win’ within large scale and complex customer environments. You’ll use a range of communication styles, a range of technology skills and experiences and a range of soft skills and people skills to develop trust relationships with both your sales colleagues and your customers.
* You will be an advocate and ambassador for Splunk through your professional social media, industry and marketing events and supporting pipeline generation activities
* You will collaborate with your customer contacts, and build them into Splunk champions, by helping them to understand how Splunk can help them to solve some of their most challenging problems and help them achieve their objectives.


Responsibilities:* Ability to demonstrate Splunk products and services to customers on site, remotely via webinar sessions, and at field events such as conferences and trade shows.

* Business Savvy: You understand how businesses are organized, how they achieve their desired results, what challenges they are likely to face, what solutions they need and what transformations they could make with your solutions.
* A growth mindset: You build in time to develop your skills, knowledge, experience or capabilities. You look beyond the current opportunity towards the wider set of opportunities that could exist in a prospect.
* A Collaborator: You understand that selling is a team game, so you spend time developing your network of colleagues and partners to achieve your success – and theirs.
* Competitive: If you’re in it, you want to win it!
* Fun: Getting the job done and enjoying & generating fun don’t need to be mutually exclusive.
* The candidate must be based in the Netherlands and be fluent in Dutch and English.

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!
