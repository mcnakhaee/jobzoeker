https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=ffae4899aa0d0e69,indeed,Computer Science | Data Science Graduation Internship: Probability Causality Analysis in Complex Systems,ASML,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Asml,"Veldhoven, NB, NL","fulltime, internship",2024-05-03,,,,,False,,,,"**Introduction**
----------------

Are you a master student looking for your graduation project in industry? Is your study related to Computer Science or Data Science in the engineering domain? Do you have proven experience with Data Analytics? This assignment could be interesting for you!


**Background information**
--------------------------

ASML has thousands of lithography machines operating 24/7 at chip factories throughout the world. Due to their extreme accuracy, problems with lithography machines occur quite regularly. Downtime in a high-end chip factory is extremely costly: nominal costs for customers can be $20 per second of unscheduled downtime.  



  

Performance problems on these machines are manually diagnosed mainly by constantly measuring (at sample intervals of minutes/hours/days) thousands of signals generated inside the machine. These signals are collected daily for all ASML machines in the field. In the past, this kind of data has mainly been used by human experts.  



  

The ambition is to transition to structural automated monitoring whereby software helps capture the knowledge of the experts to allow generalists to deal with common failure modes. Some parameters are monitored and can give an indication of the likelihood of the cause. However, several parameters can represent an anomaly and one event can be caused by several causes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a methodology that better covers all these issues and leads to the most probable cause.


**Your assignment**
-------------------

You will analyze and compare methods to determine the probable causality between symptoms and failure mode from a large population of ASML machines in such a way that shift the decision taking from expert to model based. The goal is to find the most effective method.


This helps disseminate knowledge, check “known” assumptions and, where possible, the system should makes unexpected behavior (“strangely enough X leads to Y”) explicit. This helps empirically investigate complex system behavior and discover forgotten or unknown dependencies. We would prefer actual working examples of the techniques/ideas/approaches discussed.


*This position requires access to controlled technology, as defined in the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. § 730, et seq.). Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such controlled technology prior to beginning work. Business demands may require ASML to proceed with candidates who are immediately eligible to access controlled technology.*

**Your profile**
----------------

To be the perfect match for this assignment, you:


* are a master student in Computer Science, Data Science or something related, within the engineering domain;
* have relevant experience in maintenance, Python and data analytics;
* have good communication and analytical skills, a hands-on attitude, and you deal well with uncertainty. Furthermore, you are proactive and you have a good knowledge of English, both written and spoken.
* have a sufficient motivation to work on this assignment. Hence, a cover letter is required.

This assignment is suitable for a master student looking for a graduation assignment. The minimum duration is 6 months, preferably 5 days per week (minimum 3 days on-site). The starting date is September 2024.


*Please note that we can only consider students who are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship.*

**Change the world – one nanometer at a time**
----------------------------------------------

Become an intern at a Dutch company that’s a global industry leader. You’ll gain valuable experience in a highly innovative environment – one that sparks your imagination and creativity. In addition to a monthly internship allowance of maximum €600 (plus a possible housing and free public transport), you’ll get practical guidance from experts in the field and the chance to work in and experience a dynamic team environment.


**ASML - be part of progress**
------------------------------

ASML is a high-tech company headquartered in the Netherlands. We manufacture the complex lithography machines that chipmakers use to produce integrated circuits, or computer chips. What we do is at the heart of all the electronic devices that keep us informed, entertained and connected. Every day, you use electronics that simply wouldn’t exist without our machines.


Behind ASML’s innovations are engineers who think ahead. The people who work at our company include some of the most creative minds in physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, chemistry, mechatronics, optics, mechanical engineering, computer science and fields which are not technical oriented.


We believe we can always do better. We believe the winning idea can come from anyone. We love what we do – not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard.


**Students - getting ready for real-world R&D**
-----------------------------------------------

We’re a global team of more than 40.000 people of 140 different nationalities and counting. Headquartered in Europe’s top tech hub, the Brainport Eindhoven region in the Netherlands, our operations are spread across Europe, Asia and the US.


In such an environment, your colleagues may be sitting next door, or they could be thousands of kilometers away in a different country – or even working for a different company.


An internship at ASML is the opportunity to get to know not only the world of industrial-strength R&D, but yourself – you’ll discover just what excites you most. Will you design a part of the machine, or make sure it gets built to the tightest possible specifications? Will you write software that drives the system to its best performance, or work side-by-side with the engineers of our customers in a fab, optimizing a system to the requirements of the customer?


**Diversity and inclusion**
---------------------------

ASML is an Equal Opportunity Employer that values and respects the importance of a diverse and inclusive workforce. It is the policy of the company to recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. We recognize that diversity and inclusion is a driving force in the success of our company.

**Data Engineer**

  

Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.

  

Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

 **Job Description**

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

  

Till now, teams within DDP have been ingesting the data of the Data Producers into the data platform, supporting the Data Consumers with accessing the data and even creating datasets for them. This is changing in the coming months, where we move towards our new Data Strategy. So, what is the change you might think?

  

Well, as stated Thor is designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers, meaning that Data Producers can onboard their own data in a Self-Service manner, without having a dedicated team within DDP doing this for them. This makes the data flow easier, where a Data Consumers requests the data to the Data Producers, and they ensure it's delivered for them.


Besides ensuring that data ingestion gets easier, DDP is also working on various enablement blocks on the data platform, to make the life of our Consumers easier when it comes to data preparation for data products they work on. You can think of having a standardized package that builds up a DataMart in a few clicks. It is not there yet but soon to come!

  

So, what will be your job…

  

We are looking for Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen. An inhouse self-built engine for creating DataMarts and datasets on top of our self-service data platform Thor.

  

You as a data engineer will join a team of Data Engineers that has been exploring all the options there are in the market concerning the creation of a DataMart.


We have various types of Stakeholders, such as Data Analyst, Data Scientists but also PowerBI users.  

Our aim is to create a DataMart engine which can be deployed across the organization, allowing consumers to have data modelled like they were used to in our old Data Warehouse called Pallas.

  

We finished testing our first two PoC’s earlier this year, which was a success! The DataMart engine is now being worked on to go to Production by the end of quarter 2, 2024 and many use cases are waiting for this to happen.


To be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataMart Engine, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!

  

That is why we need you!

 **Key Responsibilities**

  

* Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation for the DataMart Engine
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Ensure the DataMart is being built in such manner that it’s a (versioned) package we can deliver, as we won’t be owning the DataMart.
* Train others in making right usage of DataMart engine
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting
* Changes of DataKitchen engine version made available via pull mechanism.

  



**Requirements**

  

* >7 years’ work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* Very experienced with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of Data Modelling, Orchestration and Observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience;
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!;
* Flexible working hours;
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy;
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee;
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train;
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year;
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits;
* A company laptop and telephone.

 **Ready to contribute to our mission?**  

Do you want to play an active role in changing the food retail landscape as we know it? Then hop on board and join us on our expedition. Would you like to learn more first, before you apply to Albert Heijn? We’re happy to tell you everything about this vacancy! An assessment might be part of our selection process.

**Introduction**
----------------

Are you a master student looking for your graduation project in industry? Is your study related to Computer Science or Data Science in the engineering domain? Do you have proven experience with Data Analytics? This assignment could be interesting for you!


**Background information**
--------------------------

ASML has thousands of lithography machines operating 24/7 at chip factories throughout the world. Due to their extreme accuracy, problems with lithography machines occur quite regularly. Downtime in a high-end chip factory is extremely costly: nominal costs for customers can be $20 per second of unscheduled downtime.  



  

Performance problems on these machines are manually diagnosed mainly by constantly measuring (at sample intervals of minutes/hours/days) thousands of signals generated inside the machine. These signals are collected daily for all ASML machines in the field. In the past, this kind of data has mainly been used by human experts.  



  

The ambition is to transition to structural automated monitoring whereby software helps capture the knowledge of the experts to allow generalists to deal with common failure modes. Some parameters are monitored and can give an indication of the likelihood of the cause. However, several parameters can represent an anomaly and one event can be caused by several causes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a methodology that better covers all these issues and leads to the most probable cause.


**Your assignment**
-------------------

You will analyze and compare methods to determine the probable causality between symptoms and failure mode from a large population of ASML machines in such a way that shift the decision taking from expert to model based. The goal is to find the most effective method.


This helps disseminate knowledge, check “known” assumptions and, where possible, the system should makes unexpected behavior (“strangely enough X leads to Y”) explicit. This helps empirically investigate complex system behavior and discover forgotten or unknown dependencies. We would prefer actual working examples of the techniques/ideas/approaches discussed.


*This position requires access to controlled technology, as defined in the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. § 730, et seq.). Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such controlled technology prior to beginning work. Business demands may require ASML to proceed with candidates who are immediately eligible to access controlled technology.*

**Your profile**
----------------

To be the perfect match for this assignment, you:


* are a master student in Computer Science, Data Science or something related, within the engineering domain;
* have relevant experience in maintenance, Python and data analytics;
* have good communication and analytical skills, a hands-on attitude, and you deal well with uncertainty. Furthermore, you are proactive and you have a good knowledge of English, both written and spoken.
* have a sufficient motivation to work on this assignment. Hence, a cover letter is required.

This assignment is suitable for a master student looking for a graduation assignment. The minimum duration is 6 months, preferably 5 days per week (minimum 3 days on-site). The starting date is September 2024.


*Please note that we can only consider students who are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship.*

**Change the world – one nanometer at a time**
----------------------------------------------

Become an intern at a Dutch company that’s a global industry leader. You’ll gain valuable experience in a highly innovative environment – one that sparks your imagination and creativity. In addition to a monthly internship allowance of maximum €600 (plus a possible housing and free public transport), you’ll get practical guidance from experts in the field and the chance to work in and experience a dynamic team environment.


**ASML - be part of progress**
------------------------------

ASML is a high-tech company headquartered in the Netherlands. We manufacture the complex lithography machines that chipmakers use to produce integrated circuits, or computer chips. What we do is at the heart of all the electronic devices that keep us informed, entertained and connected. Every day, you use electronics that simply wouldn’t exist without our machines.


Behind ASML’s innovations are engineers who think ahead. The people who work at our company include some of the most creative minds in physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, chemistry, mechatronics, optics, mechanical engineering, computer science and fields which are not technical oriented.


We believe we can always do better. We believe the winning idea can come from anyone. We love what we do – not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard.


**Students - getting ready for real-world R&D**
-----------------------------------------------

We’re a global team of more than 40.000 people of 140 different nationalities and counting. Headquartered in Europe’s top tech hub, the Brainport Eindhoven region in the Netherlands, our operations are spread across Europe, Asia and the US.


In such an environment, your colleagues may be sitting next door, or they could be thousands of kilometers away in a different country – or even working for a different company.


An internship at ASML is the opportunity to get to know not only the world of industrial-strength R&D, but yourself – you’ll discover just what excites you most. Will you design a part of the machine, or make sure it gets built to the tightest possible specifications? Will you write software that drives the system to its best performance, or work side-by-side with the engineers of our customers in a fab, optimizing a system to the requirements of the customer?


**Diversity and inclusion**
---------------------------

ASML is an Equal Opportunity Employer that values and respects the importance of a diverse and inclusive workforce. It is the policy of the company to recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

Till now, teams within DDP have been ingesting the data of the Data Producers into the data platform, supporting the Data Consumers with accessing the data and even creating datasets for them. This is changing in the coming months, where we move towards our new Data Strategy. So, what is the change you might think?

  

Well, as stated Thor is designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers, meaning that Data Producers can onboard their own data in a Self-Service manner, without having a dedicated team within DDP doing this for them. This makes the data flow easier, where a Data Consumers requests the data to the Data Producers, and they ensure it's delivered for them.


Besides ensuring that data ingestion gets easier, DDP is also working on various enablement blocks on the data platform, to make the life of our Consumers easier when it comes to data preparation for data products they work on.

We finished testing our first two PoC’s earlier this year, which was a success! The DataMart engine is now being worked on to go to Production by the end of quarter 2, 2024 and many use cases are waiting for this to happen.


To be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataMart Engine, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!

  

That is why we need you!

 **Key Responsibilities**

  

* Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation for the DataMart Engine
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Ensure the DataMart is being built in such manner that it’s a (versioned) package we can deliver, as we won’t be owning the DataMart.
* Train others in making right usage of DataMart engine
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting
* Changes of DataKitchen engine version made available via pull mechanism.

  



**Requirements**

* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of Data Modelling, Orchestration and Observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience;
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!;
* Flexible working hours;
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy;
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee;
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train;

**Data Engineer**


Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.


Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform **suite**, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

 **So, what will be your job…**


We are looking for a Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen (*food and tech pun intended*) that is part of the Thor suite. The DataKitchen is an inhouse self-built framework for transforming conformed and cleansed data (*silver layer*) into DataMarts (*gold layer*) that are directly consumable for analysis and business use.


As a Data Engineer for the DataKitchen, you'll be the master chef behind the scenes, and be challenged with transforming and loading data as efficiently as possible and orchestrating all transformations. You'll also engage in stakeholder management, leveraging the latest cloud technologies to enhance efficiency and automate infrastructure deployment. Of course this all needs to be built in a secure manner and be in line with the data strategy to make DataKitchen as self-service as possible.


Currently we’re using the following tech stack to achieve our vision:

* GIT for version control
* Terraform for infrastructure deployment to Azure (we’re thinking about migrating to OpenTofu)
* GitHub actions for CI/CD
* Delta Lake as storage format
* Python for our codebase
* Databricks as our Lakehouse platform (Spark)
* PySpark for data transformations


But you won't be working alone. You will join a team of Data Engineers that are currently productionizing the first version of the DataKitchen. We expect to go into production by the end of the second quarter this year. However, to be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataKitchen, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!


If you're ready to contribute your expertise to shape the future of data excellence across all brands in Europe and maybe even beyond, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey.

 **Key Responsibilities**

* *Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation of the* ***DataKitchen***
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Train others in making right usage of the **DataKitchen**
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting

 **Requirements**

* **5 or more** years of work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* **Experienced** with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of **data transformation,** **data processing,** data modelling, orchestration and observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and on top of that a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience;
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!;
* Flexible working hours;
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy;
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee;
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train;
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year;
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits;
* A company laptop and telephone

Students: getting ready for real-world R&D
  

We’re a global team of about 39,000 people of 140 different nationalities and counting. Headquartered in Europe’s top tech hub, the Brainport Eindhoven region in the Netherlands, our operations are spread across Europe, Asia and the US.
  

  

In such an environment, your colleagues may be sitting next door, or they could be thousands of kilometers away in a different country – or even working for a different company.
  

  

An internship at ASML is the opportunity to get to know not only the world of industrial-strength R&D, but yourself – you’ll discover just what excites you most. Will you design a part of the machine, or make sure it gets built to the tightest possible specifications? Will you write software that drives the system to its best performance, or work side-by-side with the engineers of our customers in a fab, optimizing a system to the requirements of the customer?


*How will you be part of progress?*

You care deeply about continuous learning, not just by doing it yourself but also by mentoring those around you.


* We approach machine learning solutions as full-stack software development projects and use technologies such as Python, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras and Databricks.
* Bringing solutions to production is key, so scalable deployment, model interfacing and model monitoring are important aspects that you will come across.

The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) at the University of Amsterdam is looking for an ambitious and motivated Postdoc in Acoustic Biodiversity Monitoring for a 30-month (2.5 year) position within the European-funded Biodiversa+ project TABMON.  


The central objective of the project TABMON (Towards a Transnational Acoustic Biodiversity MOnitoring Network) is to develop a transnational biodiversity monitoring with autonomous acoustic sensors across a large latitudinal range in Europe, demonstrating how acoustic sensing can complement existing monitoring efforts to fill current gaps in reporting to EU directives and assessing targets of the EU Biodiversity Strategy target. The position is part of an internationally diverse and world-leading team of ecologists, computer scientists, engineers, and stakeholders. It will develop showcases for integrating acoustic observations with traditional monitoring data from structured monitoring schemes, with a focus on Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) of species distributions, population abundance and migration phenology of birds. The showcases will test approaches for model-based data integration with the aim to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

Your work will be embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab of the Theoretical and Computational Ecology Department of IBED. It will involve collaborations with other partners from the Netherlands (e.g. SOVON, CBS Statistics Netherlands, Netherlands Institute of Ecology NIOO-KNAW, University of Tilburg, Naturalis Biodiversity Centre) and abroad (Forest Science and Technology Center of Catalonia in Spain, University of Toulon in France, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research in Norway). It will also connect to other Dutch biodiversity projects such as LTER-LIFE and the biodiversity monitoring demonstration sites of ARISE.  

**What are you going to do?**  


You will integrate acoustic observations from a cutting-edge, high-throughput and fully autonomous acoustic monitoring system called Bugg with data from structured biodiversity monitoring schemes, i.e. conventional surveys with repeatable protocols and/or a stratified sampling design. In this context, you will develop showcases with model-based data integration to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

You will address some of the future needs for EBV workflows as identified by EuropaBON, i.e., developing an autonomous, network-connected, cloud-based, and transnational acoustic biodiversity monitoring system based on EBV workflows with digital sensors and automated end-to-end data streams. The EBV showcases will focus on birds and include improving species distribution data for inconspicuous or night-active species (e.g. harmonizing and integrating different detection probabilities and encounter rates), outlining statistical tools and models to estimate population abundance (e.g. N-mixture models or indices of vocal activities), and quantification of migration phenology (e.g. migrant bird arrival, departure, or intensity of migration). This will provide a basis for near-real time, harmonized and standardized EBV data.  


**Tasks and responsibilities:**
* Handling, assembling and processing large bioacoustic datasets;
* Maintaining bioacoustics sensor deployments and their automated data streams;
* Developing and applying model-based biodiversity data integration tools;
* Statistical modelling of biodiversity data;
* Working with ecologists, computer scientists and stakeholders from research institutes; universities, national parks and NGOs;
* Writing publications in peer-reviewed journals to present the scientific results or developed tools;
* Applying open science principles (e.g. data papers, open source code, metadata specifications).

  


**What do you have to offer?**  


Your experience and profile

The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic (soil and water quality) and biotic factors (ecology and evolution of plants, animals, and microorganisms), and the interplay between those. The IBED vision includes research encompassing experimental and theoretical approaches at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e. from molecules and microorganisms to patterns and processes occurring at the global scale. The University of Amsterdam has excellent high performance computing facilities. Furthermore, IBED has a dedicated computational support team with specialized knowledge of bioinformatics, (geo)database management and scientific programming. IBED also works with non-academic partners to deliver transdisciplinary science for society.  


The position is embedded in the Department of Theoretical and Computational Ecology (TCE) at IBED which focuses on understanding the complexity of ecological systems by using theoretical and advanced computational approaches. A key research focus is to address how organisms cope with changing environmental conditions and how nature and life is distributed across our planet. Within TCE, the position is embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab, a research group which aims to quantify how biodiversity and abiotic components of the Earth system vary across space and time, how they interact, and how responses of species and ecosystems to changing environmental conditions can be predicted and forecasted. The group covers a wide variety of scientific backgrounds, including ecology, data science, conservation science, physical geography, Earth science, and global change biology.

**About us**  


The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic (soil and water quality) and biotic factors (ecology and evolution of plants, animals, and microorganisms), and the interplay between those.  

The IBED vision includes research encompassing experimental and theoretical approaches at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e. from molecules and microorganisms to patterns and processes occurring at the global scale. The University of Amsterdam has excellent high performance computing facilities. Furthermore, IBED has a dedicated computational support team with specialized knowledge of bioinformatics, (geo)database management and scientific programming. IBED also works with non-academic partners to deliver transdisciplinary science for society.  


The position is embedded in the Department of Theoretical and Computational Ecology (TCE) at IBED which focuses on understanding the complexity of ecological systems by using theoretical and advanced computational approaches. A key research focus is to address how organisms cope with changing environmental conditions and how nature and life is distributed across our planet.  

Within TCE, the position is embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab, a research group which aims to quantify how biodiversity and abiotic components of the Earth system vary across space and time, how they interact, and how responses of species and ecosystems to changing environmental conditions can be predicted and forecasted. The group covers a wide variety of scientific backgrounds, including ecology, data science, conservation science, physical geography, Earth science, and global change biology.

**Data Engineer**


Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.


Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform **suite**, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

 **So, what will be your job…**


We are looking for a Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen (*food and tech pun intended*) that is part of the Thor suite. The DataKitchen is an inhouse self-built framework for transforming conformed and cleansed data (*silver layer*) into DataMarts (*gold layer*) that are directly consumable for analysis and business use.


As a Data Engineer for the DataKitchen, you'll be the master chef behind the scenes, and be challenged with transforming and loading data as efficiently as possible and orchestrating all transformations. You'll also engage in stakeholder management, leveraging the latest cloud technologies to enhance efficiency and automate infrastructure deployment. Of course this all needs to be built in a secure manner and be in line with the data strategy to make DataKitchen as self-service as possible.


Currently we’re using the following tech stack to achieve our vision:

* GIT for version control
* Terraform for infrastructure deployment to Azure (we’re thinking about migrating to OpenTofu)
* GitHub actions for CI/CD
* Delta Lake as storage format
* Python for our codebase
* Databricks as our Lakehouse platform (Spark)
* PySpark for data transformations


But you won't be working alone. You will join a team of Data Engineers that are currently productionizing the first version of the DataKitchen. We expect to go into production by the end of the second quarter this year. However, to be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataKitchen, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!


If you're ready to contribute your expertise to shape the future of data excellence across all brands in Europe and maybe even beyond, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey.

 **Key Responsibilities**

* *Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation of the* ***DataKitchen***
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Train others in making right usage of the **DataKitchen**
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting

 **Requirements**

* **5 or more** years of work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* **Experienced** with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of **data transformation,** **data processing,** data modelling, orchestration and observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and on top of that a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!
* Flexible working hours
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits
* A company laptop and telephone

 **Ready to contribute to our mission?**


Do you want to play an active role in changing the food retail landscape as we know it? Then hop on board and join us on our expedition. Would you like to learn more first, before you apply to Albert Heijn? We’re happy to tell you everything about this vacancy! An assessment might be part of our selection process.

Do you have experience with the analysis of acoustic biodiversity monitoring data? Are you interested in integrating data from digital sensors with observations from traditional monitoring methods? Do you enjoy working in an interdisciplinary academic research setting bridging ecology and computer science?  

The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) at the University of Amsterdam is looking for an ambitious and motivated Postdoc in Acoustic Biodiversity Monitoring for a 30-month (2.5 year) position within the European-funded Biodiversa+ project TABMON.  


The central objective of the project TABMON (Towards a Transnational Acoustic Biodiversity MOnitoring Network) is to develop a transnational biodiversity monitoring with autonomous acoustic sensors across a large latitudinal range in Europe, demonstrating how acoustic sensing can complement existing monitoring efforts to fill current gaps in reporting to EU directives and assessing targets of the EU Biodiversity Strategy target. The position is part of an internationally diverse and world-leading team of ecologists, computer scientists, engineers, and stakeholders. It will develop showcases for integrating acoustic observations with traditional monitoring data from structured monitoring schemes, with a focus on Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) of species distributions, population abundance and migration phenology of birds. The showcases will test approaches for model-based data integration with the aim to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

Your work will be embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab of the Theoretical and Computational Ecology Department of IBED. It will involve collaborations with other partners from the Netherlands (e.g. SOVON, CBS Statistics Netherlands, Netherlands Institute of Ecology NIOO-KNAW, University of Tilburg, Naturalis Biodiversity Centre) and abroad (Forest Science and Technology Center of Catalonia in Spain, University of Toulon in France, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research in Norway). It will also connect to other Dutch biodiversity projects such as LTER-LIFE and the biodiversity monitoring demonstration sites of ARISE.  

**What are you going to do?**  


You will integrate acoustic observations from a cutting-edge, high-throughput and fully autonomous acoustic monitoring system called Bugg with data from structured biodiversity monitoring schemes, i.e. conventional surveys with repeatable protocols and/or a stratified sampling design. In this context, you will develop showcases with model-based data integration to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

You will address some of the future needs for EBV workflows as identified by EuropaBON, i.e., developing an autonomous, network-connected, cloud-based, and transnational acoustic biodiversity monitoring system based on EBV workflows with digital sensors and automated end-to-end data streams. The EBV showcases will focus on birds and include improving species distribution data for inconspicuous or night-active species (e.g. harmonizing and integrating different detection probabilities and encounter rates), outlining statistical tools and models to estimate population abundance (e.g. N-mixture models or indices of vocal activities), and quantification of migration phenology (e.g. migrant bird arrival, departure, or intensity of migration). This will provide a basis for near-real time, harmonized and standardized EBV data.

**About us**  


The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic (soil and water quality) and biotic factors (ecology and evolution of plants, animals, and microorganisms), and the interplay between those. The IBED vision includes research encompassing experimental and theoretical approaches at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e. from molecules and microorganisms to patterns and processes occurring at the global scale. The University of Amsterdam has excellent high performance computing facilities. Furthermore, IBED has a dedicated computational support team with specialized knowledge of bioinformatics, (geo)database management and scientific programming. IBED also works with non-academic partners to deliver transdisciplinary science for society.  


The position is embedded in the Department of Theoretical and Computational Ecology (TCE) at IBED which focuses on understanding the complexity of ecological systems by using theoretical and advanced computational approaches. A key research focus is to address how organisms cope with changing environmental conditions and how nature and life is distributed across our planet. Within TCE, the position is embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab, a research group which aims to quantify how biodiversity and abiotic components of the Earth system vary across space and time, how they interact, and how responses of species and ecosystems to changing environmental conditions can be predicted and forecasted. The group covers a wide variety of scientific backgrounds, including ecology, data science, conservation science, physical geography, Earth science, and global change biology.

**Data Engineer**


Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.


Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform **suite**, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

 **So, what will be your job…**


We are looking for a Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen (*food and tech pun intended*) that is part of the Thor suite. The DataKitchen is an inhouse self-built framework for transforming conformed and cleansed data (*silver layer*) into DataMarts (*gold layer*) that are directly consumable for analysis and business use.


As a Data Engineer for the DataKitchen, you'll be the master chef behind the scenes, and be challenged with transforming and loading data as efficiently as possible and orchestrating all transformations. You'll also engage in stakeholder management, leveraging the latest cloud technologies to enhance efficiency and automate infrastructure deployment. Of course this all needs to be built in a secure manner and be in line with the data strategy to make DataKitchen as self-service as possible.


Currently we’re using the following tech stack to achieve our vision:

* GIT for version control
* Terraform for infrastructure deployment to Azure (we’re thinking about migrating to OpenTofu)
* GitHub actions for CI/CD
* Delta Lake as storage format
* Python for our codebase
* Databricks as our Lakehouse platform (Spark)
* PySpark for data transformations


But you won't be working alone. You will join a team of Data Engineers that are currently productionizing the first version of the DataKitchen. We expect to go into production by the end of the second quarter this year. However, to be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataKitchen, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!


If you're ready to contribute your expertise to shape the future of data excellence across all brands in Europe and maybe even beyond, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey.

 **Key Responsibilities**

* *Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation of the* ***DataKitchen***
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Train others in making right usage of the **DataKitchen**
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting

 **Requirements**

* **5 or more** years of work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* **Experienced** with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of **data transformation,** **data processing,** data modelling, orchestration and observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and on top of that a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!
* Flexible working hours
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits
* A company laptop and telephone

 **Ready to contribute to our mission?**


Do you want to play an active role in changing the food retail landscape as we know it? Then hop on board and join us on our expedition. Would you like to learn more first, before you apply to Albert Heijn? We’re happy to tell you everything about this vacancy! An assessment might be part of our selection process.

 ***About Quatt***  

*Quatt is an ambitious scaleup that was founded in 2021 by two entrepreneurs and brothers from the Netherlands. Our goal is to accelerate the transition to sustainable heating in the Netherlands and abroad. Our first product is a smart, hybrid heat pump for the Dutch market.*  

*The Dutch government is strongly incentivizing 8 million homeowners to get rid of natural gas and start heating sustainably within the next few decades. Unfortunately, the current pace of heat pump installations is far too low. Therefore, Quatt is improving the overall customer experience, adding smart control software, simplifying the installation job and, last but not least, greatly enhancing the aesthetics. By doing so, we want to increase adoption by an order of magnitude.*  

*We are developing a highly advanced control system based on several AI technologies, like Machine learning and Deep learning. This system enables us to operate our heat pumps, in conjunction with already installed natural gas heaters, in the most cost- or energy-efficient way, at any given day. We estimate this can reduce heating costs by about 20%. By combining this with D2C sales & installation, Quatt is aiming to reach a payback time of 3-4 years; and thus a very quick uplift in sales.*

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website.

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student.

The Tytgat group is focusing on translating findings from fundamental research to the clinic and specifically on identifying biomarkers in liquid biopsies.


**Position overview**



As a bioinformatician at the Tytgat group, you’ll be involved in projects that tests cell free DNA (cfDNA) through different platforms, such as sequencing and digital droplet PCR, with the goal to identify tumor driven aberrations that could be translated into the clinic for the development of precision medicine in pediatric cancer. Within this project, we are seeking for a highly motivated bioinformatician to develop and optimize computational systems and bioinformatics pipelines to detect genetic aberrations, mutational and DNA methylation patterns in cfDNA from various pediatric cancers, in particular kidney, sarcoma and neuroblastoma tumors. The candidate will have the opportunity to work in a highly interactive environment with projects involving different aspects of clinical research, access to high-performance computing environment, highly automated analytical pipelines and teamwork with scientists who have deep experience in data analysis, data management and delivery of high-quality results.


**Responsibilities**


* The bioinformatician will integrate and work with high-throughput sequencing data, such as whole exome sequencing (WES), gene panel sequencing, shallow whole genome sequencing (shWGS) and DNA methylation from tumor DNA as well as cfDNA from liquid biopsies.
* The candidate will be introduced to the WES/WGS pipelines of tumor DNA that are performed in a diagnostic setting at the Princess Maxima Centre. He/She will optimize these pipelines for liquid biopsy analyses. The comparable liquid biopsy pipeline will allow us to cross check different aberrations in the tumor DNA and cfDNA from the same patient to study the tumor heterogeneity, response to therapy, and early detection of relapse.
* The candidate will work closely with our collaborators from the bioinformatics group and Big Data Core facility, Dr. Patrick Kemmeren and Dr. Jayne Hehir-Kwa.


Candidates with a strong interest in oncology and pediatric cancers, and background in computational biology or bioinformatics are encouraged to apply. Having experience on liquid biopsy sequencing approaches is a big plus. The successful candidate will also have an opportunity to participate in research projects involved in the analysis of the cell free reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (cf-RRBS), identification of breakpoints in structural variants from WGS data, and Nanopore sequencing of liquid biopsies. Experience with developing and running sequencing pipelines, data analysis using R or Python and familiarity with linux/unix is required. Experience and knowledge in databases is also highly desirable.


**Requirements**


* Master or PhD in bioinformatics or similar experience in bioinformatics, computational biology, computer science or similar
* 3 years of relevant experience
* Excellent programming skills, preferably in R (familiarity with Rshiny is a plus), Python, and Unix
* Experience in analyzing NGS data, statistics, working in a high performance computing (HPC) environment
* Experience in working with high-throughput data sets and different variant calling tools (e.g. GATK, MANTA, FREEC, etc.) for single nucleotide variants, copy number aberration, structural variants, and methylation patterns
* Versatile team player able to work in a cross-disciplinary team and dynamic environment.
* Knowledge in biological sciences e.g. genomics, genetics, and transcriptomics is preferred.
* Excellent written and oral presentation skills in English.

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).

We are GNT, an ambitious and innovative family-run business with a colorful character! With our EXBERRY® brand, we are the market leader in the field of Coloring Foods. Our colorings are 100% natural and are made from fruits, vegetables and plants. We are world champions when it comes to utilizing the bounty of nature and strive to continuously innovate and improve natural color ingredients for the consumer. By carefully preserving all of nature’s beauty and goodness, we are able to offer our clients the highest quality and most reliable products. In the future, we also want to offer the most sustainable on the market. This is what continues to motivate us every day!

The most important ingredients for GNT’s success are our employees and the cooperation that exists between them. We believe in teamwork and we are there for one another, our clients, our suppliers and our partners. That is what makes us GNT.

*Due to the strong growth of our organization, we are looking for:*

**Student – Development Support of R and Shiny Apps** 

Within GNT we produce natural food colorants from various vegetables. In general, the first process step is a water extraction of the vegetable, followed by several refining and concentration steps. Typical unit operations are microfiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, evaporation but there are many more. The resulting concentrates are semifinished products, which are stored in warehouses. As a final step, the concentrates are mixed and finetuned according to specification, filled in containers and shipped to customers. These processes are monitored intensively by inline and out-of-line measurements, to assure optimal performance.

**The role:** 

To empower our employees to take better decisions in their daily work, we are increasingly collecting, aggregating and storing KPI data. The KPI data are shown in tailor-made apps, written in R using the shiny package. The apps run in a Docker environment. To speed up our app development we are looking for students who can support us with a wide variety of tasks, ranging from a few hours to several days.

Some examples of tasks on our backlog:

* Many minor fixes, such as displaying time in the correct time zone instead of UTC, making hover labels in Plotly visualizations more user-friendly, fetching additional information from databases to add to certain views, enriching Plotly elements so that links can also be opened by clicking on data points, merging several apps written according to the same template (see also point B), and many other minor adjustments/improvements.
* There is a ""template app"" for a specific group of visualization apps. We would like to convert this template into a package (for internal use), including documentation and automated tests.
* Writing specific R shiny modules to display specific visualizations. These modules can then be called from the ""template app"", which makes it simple to deploy and re-use.
* Creating a template app for another type of visualizations and also turning it into a package.
* Resolving a performance issue in one of the apps. We will likely need to make a different choice/development regarding the ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) for this app.
* Adjusting the Docker environment for more stable performance.

**About you, as our ideal student:** 

* You should already be able to program in R.
* Experience with the shiny package is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of databases (especially SQL Server) is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of Docker is a plus but not required.

If the applicant knows other languages, such as python or C++, this is a great foundation to learn R. We can suggest online learning materials, that we have found to be very useful.

**What do we find important?** 

The GNT values are the basis of our daily activities. That’s why we think it’s important that we fit together. GNT employs people who are enterprising and take responsibility. Customer and service orientation is of course paramount! We always take that extra step to offer our external and internal customers the best service. In addition, we do everything we do as sustainably as possible. We are open and honest with each other and bring out the best in each other.

**What do we offer you?** 

* A full-time gross hourly wage between €12 and €18 gross per hour, depending on your age, knowledge and experience.
* A job next to your study for 4 - 16 hours per week, if you are available for more hours that is also possible.
* A modern working environment with ambitious developers, with whom you can always spar about the latest technologies.
* We find sustainability very important. That is why we compensate - as part of our terms of employment - your carbon footprint.
* A great workplace at a successful and innovative company: GNT is on the move and so will you!

**We color the world, so do you?**

Does this vacancy suit you? Please send your motivation, cv, annual earliest possible start date to wvhelvoort@gnt-group.com. You will soon find out if you will be invited for an introductory meeting (in Mierlo).

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website.

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).

We are GNT, an ambitious and innovative family-run business with a colorful character! With our EXBERRY® brand, we are the market leader in the field of Coloring Foods. Our colorings are 100% natural and are made from fruits, vegetables and plants. We are world champions when it comes to utilizing the bounty of nature and strive to continuously innovate and improve natural color ingredients for the consumer. By carefully preserving all of nature’s beauty and goodness, we are able to offer our clients the highest quality and most reliable products. In the future, we also want to offer the most sustainable on the market. This is what continues to motivate us every day!

The most important ingredients for GNT’s success are our employees and the cooperation that exists between them. We believe in teamwork and we are there for one another, our clients, our suppliers and our partners. That is what makes us GNT.

*Due to the strong growth of our organization, we are looking for:*

**Student – Development Support of R and Shiny Apps** 

Within GNT we produce natural food colorants from various vegetables. In general, the first process step is a water extraction of the vegetable, followed by several refining and concentration steps. Typical unit operations are microfiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, evaporation but there are many more. The resulting concentrates are semifinished products, which are stored in warehouses. As a final step, the concentrates are mixed and finetuned according to specification, filled in containers and shipped to customers. These processes are monitored intensively by inline and out-of-line measurements, to assure optimal performance.

**The role:** 

To empower our employees to take better decisions in their daily work, we are increasingly collecting, aggregating and storing KPI data. The KPI data are shown in tailor-made apps, written in R using the shiny package. The apps run in a Docker environment. To speed up our app development we are looking for students who can support us with a wide variety of tasks, ranging from a few hours to several days.

Some examples of tasks on our backlog:

* Many minor fixes, such as displaying time in the correct time zone instead of UTC, making hover labels in Plotly visualizations more user-friendly, fetching additional information from databases to add to certain views, enriching Plotly elements so that links can also be opened by clicking on data points, merging several apps written according to the same template (see also point B), and many other minor adjustments/improvements.
* There is a ""template app"" for a specific group of visualization apps. We would like to convert this template into a package (for internal use), including documentation and automated tests.
* Writing specific R shiny modules to display specific visualizations. These modules can then be called from the ""template app"", which makes it simple to deploy and re-use.
* Creating a template app for another type of visualizations and also turning it into a package.
* Resolving a performance issue in one of the apps. We will likely need to make a different choice/development regarding the ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) for this app.
* Adjusting the Docker environment for more stable performance.

**About you, as our ideal student:** 

* You should already be able to program in R.
* Experience with the shiny package is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of databases (especially SQL Server) is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of Docker is a plus but not required.

If the applicant knows other languages, such as python or C++, this is a great foundation to learn R. We can suggest online learning materials, that we have found to be very useful.

**What do we find important?** 

The GNT values are the basis of our daily activities. That’s why we think it’s important that we fit together. GNT employs people who are enterprising and take responsibility. Customer and service orientation is of course paramount! We always take that extra step to offer our external and internal customers the best service. In addition, we do everything we do as sustainably as possible. We are open and honest with each other and bring out the best in each other.

**What do we offer you?** 

* A full-time gross hourly wage between €12 and €18 gross per hour, depending on your age, knowledge and experience.
* A job next to your study for 4 - 16 hours per week, if you are available for more hours that is also possible.
* A modern working environment with ambitious developers, with whom you can always spar about the latest technologies.
* We find sustainability very important. That is why we compensate - as part of our terms of employment - your carbon footprint.
* A great workplace at a successful and innovative company: GNT is on the move and so will you!

**We color the world, so do you?**

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

Translational research leverages real-world data sets to study how patients respond to cancer treatments. This research often involves integrating complex and non-standardized molecular and clinical data. Clinical datasets, designed to answer specific scientific questions, typically lack detailed data granularity, making exploration challenging. Understanding the clinical data model is crucial to selecting the appropriate variables for analysis.
This project proposes the use of graph databases to overcome these challenges by organizing data into a flexible, multidimensional structure that facilitates easier access and more intuitive querying. Graph databases, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, allow for the discovery of implicit relationships within the data that traditional table-based databases might miss. Through this initiative, we aim to develop and evaluate AI-driven querying techniques using natural language, enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets in translational research.

**That’s why we love them!**

  


Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

  

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.


Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

  

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  

Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.



In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

  

**The role in 6 bullets**

  

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

 **Your track record mentions**

  

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

  


**Why join Orbisk?**



For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

  

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

From our people who are caring, candid, and impact-driven to our business, which is innovative and rooted in science, we believe that being proudly unique, determined to be our best, and authentic is essential to fulfilling our purpose.
The role
Join our dynamic bioinformatics team at Genmab as a student data engineer, where you will play a crucial role in supporting our scientists by creating and managing sophisticated data architectures aligned with FAIR principles. In this position, you will focus on integrating real-world clinical and molecular data into graph database models to facilitate complex data analysis and enable innovative research methodologies.

This internship offers a unique opportunity to develop expertise in data engineering technologies, contribute to bioinformatics solutions, and directly impact our research in developing groundbreaking therapeutic strategies. Your work will support essential projects aimed at enhancing drug discovery and development processes, fostering your growth as a data scientist and making a meaningful impact in the field of biomedicine.*Project Background*
Translational research leverages real-world data sets to study how patients respond to cancer treatments. This research often involves integrating complex and non-standardized molecular and clinical data. Clinical datasets, designed to answer specific scientific questions, typically lack detailed data granularity, making exploration challenging. Understanding the clinical data model is crucial to selecting the appropriate variables for analysis.
This project proposes the use of graph databases to overcome these challenges by organizing data into a flexible, multidimensional structure that facilitates easier access and more intuitive querying. Graph databases, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, allow for the discovery of implicit relationships within the data that traditional table-based databases might miss. Through this initiative, we aim to develop and evaluate AI-driven querying techniques using natural language, enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets in translational research.
Responsibilities* Technology Exploration: Investigate various graph database technologies and their applicability to managing clinical data, assessing their strengths and limitations in this domain.
* Data Model Comparison: Compare and analyze the data structures of graph and relational databases to identify the most effective frameworks for clinical data.
* Pilot Database Development: Design and implement a prototype database focused on the standardization of clinical real-world data, ensuring it supports robust data integration and access.
* Natural Language Query Development: Create methods to enable querying of graph databases using natural language, employing advanced AI technologies to facilitate intuitive data interactions.
* Findings Presentation: Regularly present progress and insights during team meetings, ensuring clear communication of developments and challenges.
* Bonus Objective: Develop a user interface that enables easy querying, and effective visualization and presentation of results from the database.


Requirements* Education: You are a BSc/MSc student in bioinformatics, computational biology or a related field.
* Technical skills: Demonstrated strong technical skills, with substantial experience in Python programming. Familiarity with AWS is an added advantage.
* Soft skills: Comfortable with pioneering research and creative processes; scientific thinking and connecting that to technical requirements.


About You* You are passionate about our purpose and genuinely care about our mission to transform the lives of patients through innovative cancer treatment
* You bring rigor and excellence to all that you do. You are a fierce believer in our rooted-in-science approach to problem-solving
* You are a generous collaborator who can work in teams with diverse backgrounds

Carbon fibre composites are lightweight and strong materials that can help solve climate issues.

**That’s why we love them!**

  


Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

  

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.


Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

  

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  

Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.



In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

  

**The role in 6 bullets**

  

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

 **Your track record mentions**

  

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

  


**Why join Orbisk?**



For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

  

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.
