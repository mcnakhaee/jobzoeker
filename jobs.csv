**Your Impact**
---------------


As the Product Adoption Senior Specialist, Change Management, you will join our People Services Enablement team as part of the global People function driving the transformation of our core People and Payroll processes through digital enablement.
You will work with our global People and Payroll communities as we transform the way we provide services to our firm members. The digitization of core People processes is one of the fundamental ways we are professionalizing our firm and creating an unrivaled environment for exceptional firm function talent.
The role will focus on the rollout and implementation of the ServiceNow People \& Payroll product, a part of the firm’s ServiceNow platform, to enable our People and Payroll process transformation. ServiceNow is the firm’s service management platform that provides transparency to work, increases efficiency, and streamlines global processes. We have undergone intense growth over the past 3 years with great success. We have made substantial impact by enabling self\-help and laying the foundation for generative AI (gen AI) and digital workflows which in turn has driven more increased demand for this product and projects continued growth.
For the next horizon of work, you will drive the overall adoption of ServiceNow People \& Payroll, lead change management, and support the People and Payroll functions to fully adopt this digital platform. This includes working directly with our global community of process leads to understand and anticipate impacts and implications of this technology on roles and responsibilities, processes, and workflows. You will shape, develop, and execute a strategy for changing colleague behavior and ensuring sustainable adoption of this platform across all user communities during and beyond initial implementation.
In this role, we will rely upon your passion for learning, passion for helping others, and aptitude to test, fail and try to come up with solutions that help our end users. This role has potential to grow – on the People side: to serve as a thought partner for our global HR, Payroll and People Operations teams to best utilize this digital solution and develop effective user support strategies; on the technical side, to get exposure to product development and system design and recommend enhancements to the product to encourage deeper user adoption.
For the first year in the role, the focus will split. One focus will be on implementations to expand to more groups such as HR and Payroll into Europe, Middle East, Africa, and others as prioritized by our People leaders. A second focus is working with our product team, user researchers and designers to influence product design and development to take into account product adoption. In parallel, you will help support an existing global group of global users that has on\-going training, documentation, and digital platform needs. Since ServiceNow People \& Payroll enables most processes in the People function, you will actively collaborate across a broad set of domains and teams.
**Your Growth**
---------------


As the Product Adoption Specialist, you will be a key member of the People Services Enablement team, which operates within the broader People Technology group and collaborates closely with the Tech Ecosystem. This team bridges the gap between process and technology, leveraging digital tools to drive people and payroll process transformation, achieve business outcomes, and innovate workflows. Covering the entire firm member lifecycle—from talent acquisition and onboarding to learning, professional development, and talent management—you may also partner with other People Technology product teams to ensure seamless integration and support.
In addition to this, you will work closely with the ServiceNow Center of Excellence and Innovation (CoEI), which unifies digital capabilities across the firm, and collaborate with Tech Ecosystem resources like user research and design to ground your change management plans in user insights and thoughtful design.
In this role, you will focus on driving adoption and engagement with the ServiceNow People \& Payroll platform across a globally distributed team in Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Poland, Spain, and the United States. You will design and execute change management plans for global implementations, develop and deliver tailored training programs, and create communication strategies with supporting materials to engage stakeholders. Acting as an expert and advocate for the system, you will provide ongoing coaching to champion user groups, offer guidance to individual users and teams, and address process gaps through digital solutions.
Lastly, you will monitor user metrics to inform strategies, stay updated on product enhancements, and lead efforts to adopt new features, ensuring the platform evolves to meet user needs effectively.

In this thesis, you will generate synthetic training data by transforming low\-poly 3D models of hands and feet into photorealistic images with labeled key points.

**Areas of Interest:** Generative AI, Controllable Image Generation, Few\-shot Learning


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


The examination of Parkinson’s symptoms is highly labor\-intensive, as it requires multiple trained neurologists to thoroughly analyze hand and leg movements. A group of hospitals aims to extend Parkinson’s treatment in the Netherlands to regions where such care is currently unavailable due to a shortage of trained neurologists. To achieve this, they want to make a pre\-selection through the help of AI on a smartphone. Part of the solution is a pose estimation model to track hand and foot movements. However, the current dataset for training the model is neither large nor diverse enough. The goal is to enrich the dataset with highly varied data while minimizing the need for manual effort.


Important features for detecting hands and feet could be better balanced by enriching the training dataset with synthetic data. To prevent manual labeling of the training data, it would be ideal if the ground truth for tracking key points is synthesized along with the training images. By converting low\-poly 3D models with key point rigs into photorealistic images, a synthetic dataset of labeled training images could be generated. Your task will be to investigate how to transform low\-poly models into photorealistic images using AI.

**The Assignment**
------------------


You will create a training dataset consisting of low\-poly 3D body rigs, focusing on the hands and feet. Next, you will explore transforming these low\-poly models into photorealistic images using a pix2pix GAN model. You may also fine\-tune the model to optimize hyperparameters for generating the best results. Your findings will be documented in a thesis and presented during your thesis defense.

**About us**

Although we take more photos now than ever, we seldom print them out. This neglects all the beautiful captured moments, as among these numerous photos lie precious memories worth printing. Be it the first pictures of your newborn, your niece or nephew, the amazing city trip with friends, or a fun night out.

With klikkie, we help you celebrate life and cherish memories. We aim to inspire you to make time for small moments and enjoy the present – what truly matters. Every month brings new moments, and it's a shame to forget them. Hence, the idea is to enable everyone to print high\-quality photos with minimal effort, month after month.

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

We’re crafting a metric that measures how achievable AI\-generated advice is—for real people. Think of it as teaching AI common sense; for instance, you can’t just age a decade instantly. Your challenge: integrate advanced language models like GPT to gauge if a “what if” scenario is useful or just a tech fantasy. Join us in shaping a more sensible, user\-centric AI future.**

**Areas of Interest:** XAI/Explainable AI, LLMs/Large Language Models, ChatGPT, NLP/Natural Language Processing


Counterfactual explanations are considered an intuitive and user\-friendly form of explainable AI. A counterfactual explanation proposes minimal changes to the input data that would lead to a different model output. As an example, a bank could make use of a model to determine if a customer can get a loan or not. If a customer was denied a loan, a counterfactual explanation could tell them that, for instance, “if their savings were increased by 10\.000€, they could get the loan”.


However, counterfactual explanations are not aware of the semantics of the input features. It might be that the minimal change for a customer to get a loan is to “increase their age from 25 to 35 years old” which, from a human perspective, is evidently unfeasible in a short time span.

**The Assignment**
------------------


In this project, we would like you to design a new evaluation metric to automatically determine the practicality of counterfactuals, that is, how attainable a counterfactual explanation is (or if it is even humanly attainable). Since the determination of practicality involves semantic understanding of the input features, our idea would be to leverage GPT and/or other large language model\-based technologies to accomplish this.


A user study could be conducted initially following the methodology proposed by Spreitzer et al (1\) to evaluate the practicality of different state\-of\-the\-art counterfactual techniques. The user study can then be extended to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed metric compared to the human evaluations.

Scala is gaining more traction as a programming language for large software systems, it is used in companies such a Netflix and Twitter and is the base for many great products.


Libraries such a Finagle and Akka are being used in many JVM based products. The quality of such core components and large software systems needs to be guaranteed. For Java and other object oriented and functional programming languages code quality metrics and guidelines are available. Unfortunately for Scala, a multi paradigm programming language, this is not yet the case. We would like to research code quality metrics and guidelines for Scala. Since Scala is a multi\-paradigm language, we can use research for both objected oriented and functional programming languages.


Previously, we have shown that we are able to use existing object oriented and functional metrics to predict bug density in Scala projects. This means there is a relation between different metrics and the possibility of bugs. Additionally, we identified constructs and metrics in Scala that are prone to bugs. We would like to extend this research to be able to pinpoint such constructs in Scala code as part of code analysis in a continuous integration pipeline.

It does this by only revealing so called ‘attributes’ of a person. Can CryptPad be improved by integrating IRMA by comparing approaches for authentication and digital signatures?**

**Areas of Interest:** Cryptography, Security, Open Source


When you want to prove that you are older than 18 to buy a bottle of whiskey it shouldn’t be necessary to show your ID card which also contains your name, BSN and date of birth. Only the fact that you are 18\+ should be sufficient. IRMA can achieve this by securely disclose certain attributes about you using your mobile phone running the IRMA app (https://irma.app) It protects your privacy by only show attributes that are sufficient in this situation, namely the attributing stating that you are older than 18\. Therefore, your name and date of birth cannot be abused by a third party to commit for example identity fraud. This attribute\-based authentication only reveals what you are and not who you are.


IRMA also offers attribute\-based signatures which improve on the traditional digital signature done with a private key and a corresponding certificate containing the public key. These IRMA signatures are constructed by enclosing a number of attributes of the signer to the document. For example, signing a medical recipe using the docter’s medical attribute stating that the recipe comes from a real doctor. This is a big advantage over traditional signatures because it gives information about who actually signs it. IRMA is open source and available to integrate with other services for which authentication and signatures are important.


Such a service can be CryptPad (https://cryptpad.fr) with which you can make collaborative documents. It uses client side encryption to make sure it’s protected from other people that can access the server. Other people can read your documents by sharing your cryptographic key that is never sent to the server. Moreover, your username and password are used only to generate a unique keyring and the server only knows your signature to identify you and retrieve your documents. This Zero Knowledge application makes a good candidate to research whether integrating it with the IRMA system has further potential benefits.


You will research whether CryptPad can be improved by integrating IRMA by comparing approaches for authentication and digital signatures. Perhaps the attribute\-based signatures can add value to prove the origin of the documents you write with CryptPad? What about the different authentication flows of both systems? This research includes setting up IRMA, integrate it with CryptPad, analyze approaches and motivate your choices to potentially improve CryptPad.

Stryker Mutator, an open\-source mutation testing framework by Info Support is allready fast, but it is up to you to find areas to improve, in order to speed up mutation testing.**

**Areas of Interest:** Software Architecture, Software Development Methodologies, Open Source


A mutation testing framework will measure the effectiveness of unit tests by inserting mutants (bugs) inside your production code and running the (unit) tests. If the tests pass for a given mutant, then there might be a missing test case. The mutant ‘survived’ in that case. If at least one of the tests fails, then the mutant is ‘killed’. The percentage of killed mutants is referred to as the ‘mutation score’ and is a metric for test effectiveness.


At Info Support, we maintain Stryker Mutator, an open\-source mutation testing framework. It consists of 3 flavors: Stryker.NET (C\#), Stryker4s (Scala), and Stryker (for JavaScript and friends). For more info, see https://stryker\-mutator.io.


There are many ways of introducing mutants into the source code. Mutating sources statement by statement is a logical choice, but not good for performance as the codebase needs to be recompiled or reloaded after every mutation. Mutation switching can provide a solution to speed up the process. With mutation switching all mutants are compiled into the codebase at once and switched on one\-by\-one at runtime. In the case of Stryker.NET and Styker4s this has resulted in a significant performance boost.


We would like to increase the performance of Stryker even further. Research will focus on finding areas where improvements can be made and/or developing methodologies for speeding up mutation testing.

Traditional penetration tests help identify vulnerabilities but cannot guarantee complete coverage. In this thesis, you will explore the potential of formal verification to strengthen authentication mechanisms in a healthcare portal. By using mathematical models, you’ll investigate whether it’s possible to prove that unauthorized access can be fully prevented, providing an extra layer of confidence in the system’s security.**

**Areas of Interest:** Formal Verification, Security, Model Checking, .NET


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


One of our clients in the healthcare sector has developed a portal that facilitates communication between various organizations, reducing Dutch healthcare costs by millions of euros each year. Numerous individuals need to log into this portal daily, and it also supports system\-to\-system connections with their customers. Ensuring the security of sensitive health data is of utmost importance.


Our clients usually perform security assessments by hiring a security firm to conduct penetration tests on their systems. While effective, these pen\-tests do not guarantee 100% coverage, and it’s always possible for some leaks to go undetected.


Recent advancements in formal verification have made it possible to mathematically prove certain properties of systems. This technique has been used in security\-critical software to establish robustness (under certain assumptions). For example, the popular VPN software WireGuard has undergone of formal verification. See: Formal Verification – WireGuard


We are curious if such techniques are also applicable on the software that we develop. Our client’s portal involves several types of users, each requiring authentication. Additionally, inter\-service communication is performed in various ways, all of which are encrypted and authenticated. The system consists of multiple front\-ends, microservices, a large monolith, and system\-to\-system connections with third parties.

**The Assignment**

Your assignment is to apply formal verification to the authentication mechanism of our client’s system. For instance, you could aim to prove that it is impossible to gain unauthorized access to a part of the system. You will choose a suitable verification tool, which will likely involve creating a model of the system, selecting specific properties to verify, and formalizing them within your chosen tool. It is crucial to ensure that your model closely represents the actual system while minimizing assumptions.

However, these systems present challenges, particularly with model agnostic explanations which are more approximations.

Effective testing is crucial to verify if explanations are sensible to experts, consistent across different outcomes, and to understand when they might change.**

**Areas of Interest:** Artificial Intelligence, Explainable AI


Explainable machine learning and artificial intelligence models have been used to justify a model’s decision\-making process. This added transparency aims to help improve user performance and understanding of the underlying model. However, in practice, explainable systems face many open questions and challenges.


Model agnostic explanations are more approximations. In general there are two kinds of explanations: global and local explanations. For the latter, there’s the possibility that the explanation is off, because it only looks at the local inference. It’s possible that for opposite inference, we get exactly the same explanations. To get proper explanations we’ll need to be able to test them. Are the explanations sensible to business experts and aren’t there any same explanations for opposite outcomes? And do we know when explanations will change?

***Excited to shape the future of hearing aids? Ready to combine your expertise in Signal Processing, Optimization and Machine learning with Perception and Intelligibility?***

  


**Job description**


Good hearing is essential for active participation in society. Hearing impairments can lead to various challenges, from frustration and social isolation—such as difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments—to serious safety risks, like the inability to localize sound sources in traffic.

  


Hearing aids help mitigate hearing loss by enhancing speech intelligibility, improving sound localization, and increasing environmental awareness. However, most existing hearing aid algorithms optimize for only one of these objectives at a time, often at the expense of the others. To enhance hearing aid performance across diverse scenarios, we aim to develop innovative algorithms that dynamically balance the improvement of speech intelligibility, sound localization, and environmental awareness, dependent on the context.


To tackle this challenge, we are seeking a postdoctoral researcher with expertise in speech signal processing, optimization, machine learning, and models of hearing and perception.

  

This is a full\-time, three\-year position within the audio and speech processing team of the Signal Processing Systems (SPS) Section. In the SPS section, we conduct research in array signal processing, graph signal processing, convex optimization, distributed processing, machine learning, and tensor analysis. Our applications span various domains, including audio and acoustics, wireless communication, radio astronomy, biomedical signal processing, and distributed sensing from space.

  


Your Role


* Conduct innovative research on signal processing for hearing aids.
* Contribute to writing research proposals.

 Assist with the supervision of students and teaching activities.  
* 

**Job requirements**


* PhD in a relevant field (e.g., electrical engineering, acoustics, or a related discipline).
* Strong background in speech signal processing, machine learning, and optimization.
* Experienced with models of hearing and perception.
* Experienced with C/C\+\+ and/or Matlab/Python
* Good communication skills for interaction with the other members of the team are expected.
* Good English language skills in order to closely cooperate with colleagues and students as well as to write scientific papers.

**Role description**
--------------------


At Medis, we are committed to staying at the forefront of technological innovation. As part of this ambition, we are exploring how Generative AI, including LLMs and agentic AI, can enhance our software development, data workflows, and product innovation.

We are looking for a curious and hands\-on Generative AI Intern to support this exploration. In this role, you will collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to identify and assess use cases, evaluate risks and opportunities, and build proof\-of\-concept solutions that demonstrate the value of GenAI across Medis — from MedTech innovation to internal workflows and software development processes.
  

This is an applied research internship focused on the practical use of existing AI tools—not on developing new deep learning models or neural networks. You’ll work with tools like ChatGPT, open\-source LLMs, prompt engineering techniques, and agentic AI frameworks to test and validate ideas.
  

**The profile we are looking for:**
-----------------------------------


* Currently enrolled in a Master’s program focused on Artificial Intelligence (e.g., AI, Applied AI, Cognitive AI, AI \& Data Science, or similar).
* Familiarity with generative AI tools and concepts (e.g., LLMs, agentic AI, prompt engineering).
* Hands\-on experience with scripting or prototyping using tools such as Python, JavaScript, or Node.js.
* Familiarity with frameworks such as LangChain, Hugging Face, or vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate) is a plus.
* Currently residing in the Netherlands.
* Available for a period of 6 months, for at least 32 hours per week.
**Personal skills and competences**
-----------------------------------


* Analytical and proactive.
* Comfortable working both independently and collaboratively within a team.
* Can clearly communicate complex technical ideas to both technical and non\-technical colleagues.
* Excellent written and spoken English.
**What Medis offers you:**
--------------------------


* Hands\-on experience with cutting\-edge Generative AI tools, working on real\-world projects with a multidisciplinary team, in a forward\-thinking company.
* A supportive environment where your ideas and initiative are valued.
* A competitive internship allowance and reimbursement for travel expenses.
* Flexible, hybrid working environment with international and young colleagues.

**The Opportunity: Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst**


We are looking for an experienced Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst to take a lead role in transforming data into actionable insights that drive strategic decision\-making across the company. In this hands\-on role, you will design and deliver business\-critical dashboards and analytical reports that inform how we improve patient access and grow our business. As a senior individual contributor on our Data \& Analytics team, you’ll work alongside a Data Engineer and fellow Analysts within our Product \& Engineering organization. You will collaborate cross\-functionally with stakeholders in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial, and Product, becoming a go\-to expert for data insights.


**What You'll be Doing:**


In your first 3–6 months, you will hit the ground running by spearheading the creation of several high\-impact dashboards, including:

* Client Program Performance Dashboards – to monitor and visualize our patient programs' performance and identify opportunities to improve outcomes.
* Revenue Tracking Dashboards – to provide real\-time visibility into revenue streams and financial KPIs, helping steer commercial strategy.

**This is the right opportunity for you if:**

* Design, build, and maintain interactive dashboards and reports in Tableau (and other BI tools) to track key metrics across the business. You will own end\-to\-end dashboard development – from gathering requirements to data modeling and visualization – ensuring stakeholders have self\-service access to up\-to\-date insights.
* Deliver actionable insights for growth: Analyze operational and marketing data (from MySQL/PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases, Airflow, Excel, etc.) to understand key performance drivers. Translate data into clear findings and recommendations that drive user acquisition, patient engagement, and sustainable business growth.
* Be the analytical partner for leadership: Serve as a point of contact for the leadership team on all things data. Provide in\-depth reporting, ad\-hoc analysis, and executive\-friendly dashboards that inform strategic decisions and highlight trends in business performance.
* Focus on data quality and accuracy: Work closely with our Data Engineer and product engineers to ensure we have reliable, well\-structured data. Help maintain and validate data models, databases and data pipelines so that reports are accurate and reflect the single source of truth. Identify any data gaps or integrity issues and collaborate on solutions.
* Drive performance improvements: Monitor key KPIs (such as program success metrics, funnel conversion rates, revenue metrics) and proactively identify operational bottlenecks or areas for improvement. Provide insight\-driven suggestions to optimize workflows, improve patient recruitment, or streamline processes.
* Cross\-functional collaboration: Partner with teams in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial and Product to understand their analytics needs. Support these stakeholders by building custom reports or exploratory analysis, and ensure they can leverage your dashboards for day\-to\-day decision making. For example, you might deep\-dive into marketing funnel data to advise the Growth team, or analyze operational turnaround times to assist the Operations team.
* Advanced analysis and data exploration: Use Python (with pandas, numpy, etc.) and SQL for deeper ad\-hoc analyses, data discovery, and data preparation. When questions go beyond existing reports, you’ll dig into raw data to uncover insights, validate hypotheses, and prepare datasets for further analysis.
* Mentorship and best practices: As a senior analyst, mentor and guide junior analysts on the team. Review their work, share knowledge of best practices in analytics, SQL querying, and visualization. Lead by example in documentation and reproducibility. You will also enable business users’ self\-service by training stakeholders on how to use established dashboards and reporting tools effectively.
* Shape data strategy: Contribute to our overall data strategy by identifying new metrics or analytics opportunities that can drive value. Advocate for a data\-driven mindset across the organization. You’ll play a key role in evolving our analytics capabilities (for instance, suggesting new BI features or improving reporting processes) to support a scaling, high\-growth environment.

* Experience using Python for data analysis tasks – e.g. data cleaning, exploration, and validation using libraries such as pandas or numpy. Must be comfortable scripting to manipulate data when needed.

Experience creating a variety of chart types and visuals – from standard bar/line charts to more advanced visuals like Sankey diagrams or funnel charts – to illustrate user flows and attribution. An eye for design and attention to detail in dashboards ensuring they are accurate, easy to interpret, and visually engaging.
* Analytical Mindset: Excellent analytical and problem\-solving skills. Capable of interpreting complex datasets, identifying trends and outliers, and connecting the dots between data and business outcomes. You approach problems with curiosity and a hypothesis\-driven mindset.
* Business Acumen: Strong understanding of business metrics and growth drivers. Ability to translate business questions from non\-technical stakeholders into analytical approaches, and then translate back findings into business terms. Experience working on metrics like revenue, conversion funnels, customer acquisition cost, etc., is highly valued.
* Exceptional communication skills in English (our company language). You can distill complex analyses into clear insights and narratives for different audiences. Comfortable presenting findings to senior leadership and guiding discussions on data.
* Collaboration: Proven ability to work cross\-functionally and build positive relationships with diverse teams — from operations managers to product designers. You’re a team player who can align data projects with the needs of multiple departments and manage stakeholder expectations.
