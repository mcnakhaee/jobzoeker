In the Geometric Learning and Differential Geometry Group (GLDG) within the Centre for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications (CASA) we invent, apply, and build new theory and methods in geometric AI for automated medical and industrial image analysis. The Geometric Deep learning methods developed in GLDG bridge the gap in image processing between machine learning and traditional PDE/geometry-based methods.


The focus in the group GLDG supported by VICI project “Geometric Learning for Image Analysis” (R. Duits) is on PDE-based equivariant neural networks aiming for impact on industry and society. This requires close interplay between mathematical theory and practical requirements. With implementation running parallel to theoretical development, we ensure that our geometric learning is both well-founded in profound new mathematics and relevant for practical applications.


Key objectives of the position are:

* Open the black box of deep learning via geometric interpretability and explainable AI. Promising results are growing and allow for clear analysis by experts, but intuitive visualization and interpretation tools to industrial/health tech partners raise challenges to be tackled.
* Design new equivariant PDE-based neural networks**.** Current methods in GLDG reveal drastic network reduction, and training data-reduction with better performances. Pursue a research direction in explainable and transferable geometric AI. Analysis of topological transitions, semi-ring co-domain extensions, Lie group domain extensions require new models.
* Connect to the GLDG group, the CASA cluster, and the M&CS department at TU/e, and act in cross-divisional institutes such as EAISI**,** to guarantee a vibrant, well-embedded and well-funded research group with better network design and image analysis applications.

#### 
**We’re hiring a Cloud Engineer (AWS) to join the Smart Sorting Platform Team!**

###### **Description**


Prime Vision’s Intelligence department is the backbone of most systems delivered to our customers. By handling sorting center and equipment definitions, orchestrating coding flows, executing and retrieving OCR requests, and communicating with customer backend systems locally and in the cloud, the Intelligence department has first-hand production experience in the postal and parcel domain. With the most experienced software engineers in the company, our sorting system helps our customers simplify and centralize their sorting process while guaranteeing high throughput in the cloud. We need a talented engineer passionate about evolving cloud technologies who can pick up AWS skills and backend TypeScript programming to join our team and drive our mission-critical platform forward.

###### **Your job**


As a Cloud Engineer (AWS) Engineer, you will be pivotal in making our AWS setup reliable, repeatable, and highly performant. You will be designing and implementing observability practices to increase fault tolerance in a distributed system, and you will learn to address millions of requests in a Serverless Lambda architecture. You will collaborate closely with the Smart Data Manager to implement efficient business rules. Further, you will discuss with the Smart Analytics team how to make sense of the data post-sorting.

Parent-infant physical closeness (PIPC) sharply decreases over the first months in Western families, while studies show that PIPC is important for healthy child development and potentially also for maternal wellbeing. PIPC may hence offer unique opportunities to support both child development and new parents’ wellbeing. However, large gaps in knowledge on fathers, causal associations, underlying mechanisms, and long-term relations preclude further developments. Will you help us with further research?***  

  

This 4-year project is financed by NWO and focused on early parenthood and infancy and will be lead by Prof Dr. Carolina de Weerth (Developmental Psychobiology Lab).  

  

Our multidisciplinary team will fill these gaps with sophisticated intervention, experimental, and longitudinal studies on daily life PIPC: baby carrying, skin-to-skin contact, and room sharing. We will determine whether, to what extent, and through what mechanisms easily accessible avenues for increasing PIPC can lead to improved maternal, paternal, and child mental and physical health, both concurrently as well as later in childhood and adolescence.  

  

The project includes collaborators from Erasmus University Rotterdam, Utrecht University, and University of Trento. You will be part of a team consisting of senior researchers, a PhD student, a student assistant, as well as perinatal professionals and parents. You will be affiliated to the Donders Institute for Brain Cognition and Behaviour and the Baby & Child Research Center.  

  

We offer a challenging position in an innovative project within a team of dedicated colleagues. Our collaboration is characterized by creativity, collegiality, team work, and responsibility.

Job description


Autonomous vehicles have been shown to underperform when deployed on conditions that differ substantially from the training conditions, so-called domain gaps. These domain gaps can include deployment in different regions, weather or using different sensors. Numerous domain adaptation methods have been proposed to bridge these domain gaps and let the model operate well on the target data. In this project we seek to find an intermediate representation for data coming from varied sources. By bringing new data into this representation, we overcome domain gaps and are able to train models that are robust to different conditions, also referred to as foundation models. While foundation models have achieved widespread success on images and text, currently none exist for radar data, making this a promising research direction. These foundation models will bring superior performance and allow us to utilize data from varied sources, thus reducing the data collection and labeling costs.



The Intelligent Vehicles section at TU Delft, the Netherlands, invites applications for a fully funded two-year (up to 30 months) Post-Doctoral research position in the area of foundation models for autonomous vehicles. This position is part of the EU Horizon project Cynergie4MIE and in collaboration with the chip company NXP. While the exact task (detection, segmentation) is flexible, it should make use of radar sensors, potentially fused with other sensors. Your results will be published in top tier conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICRA and NeurIPS. For your work you will have access to the compute resources of TU Delft, ranging from personal machines, to shared GPU servers, the Delft AI Cluster that is shared across departments, as well as DelftBlue, which is one of the top 250 supercomputers in the world. Your main supervisor will be Dr. Holger Caesar, creator of the nuScenes dataset and co-author of the PointPillars method for lidar-based object detection. You will receive hands-on mentoring for your career development and help with applying for future research grants, to kick-start your continued academic career.


Requirements


* We are seeking Post-Doc applicants with an interest in performing cutting edge research in an active and exciting research area.
* Prospective applicants should have a strong academic record with a solid background in sensor processing (vision/radar/lidar, sensor fusion) and Machine Learning (Deep Learning, domain adaptation, foundation models).
* Good programming skills (Python/Matlab) and knowledge of deep-learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch) are expected.
* A certain affinity towards turning complex concepts into real-world practice (i.e. vehicle demonstrator) is desired.
* The successful candidate is expected to be able to act independently as well as to collaborate effectively with members of a larger team and supervise Master and PhD students. Good English skills are required.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



From 1 September next, a salary increase of 3.7% applies due to a Collective Agreement amendment, followed by an additional 1% increase on 1 January 2025. In addition, most employees employed on 1 September 2024 will receive a one-off payment of €300 gross based on full-time employment.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

Job description


Autonomous vehicles have come a long way from initial public testing with safety drivers to fully driverless deployments in multiple cities across the world. However, to further improve these vehicles, they need to be trained from ever growing data sources collected by their fleets. Due to the vast cost of storing and processing this data, car manufacturers face the problem that they can only store a fraction of it (storing 1h of data costs about $5000 per year). Therefore new paradigms are needed to reduce the storage and processing cost.



Federated learning is such a novel paradigm that revolutionizes how Machine Learning systems are trained. Rather than storing all data on a central server and training there, federated learning allows us to learn in a distributed way. In the case of autonomous vehicles, this means that every vehicle can perform training steps while the system is idle, thereby saving energy and bandwidth. Furthermore, federated learning is much less privacy-sensitive, since sensor data of faces does not need to be transferred to the cloud.



The Intelligent Vehicles section at TU Delft, the Netherlands, invites applications for a fully funded two-year (up to 30 months) Post-Doctoral research position in the area of federated learning for autonomous vehicles. This position is part of the EU Horizon project Cynergie4MIE and in collaboration with the chip company NXP. You will be one of the first to train modern perception and/or prediction (a.k.a. motion forecasting) algorithms in a federated learning setup and provide an analysis of the pros and cons of this approach. While the exact task (detection, segmentation, prediction) is flexible, it should make use of radar sensors, potentially fused with other sensors. Your results will be published in top tier conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICRA and NeurIPS. For your work you will have access to the compute resources of TU Delft, ranging from personal machines, to shared GPU servers, the Delft AI Cluster that is shared across departments, as well as DelftBlue, which is one of the top 250 supercomputers in the world.

**Vision - Quantum Safe Communications Testbed in Eindhovens**  

Secure communications and networking have become a key cornerstone for the Internet enabling several trusted applications which we take for granted today. For example, services such as digital banking, connected transport, digital medical records, defence, governmental and of course data communications – would be challenging should the trust in modern communication systems be lost. As quantum technologies progress rapidly, the growing capabilities of quantum computers threatens the security and then the trust of current cryptographic technologies and protocols. Preventing this threat requires adoption of quantum safe cryptography in the form of post-quantum crypto (PQC) algorithms and protocols and/or using quantum key distribution (QKD). Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) has established an open access testbed for quantum safe communications where various QKD and PQC solutions are evaluated and tested. Various research activities at TU/e are developing network protocols and solutions for quantum safe communications, as well continuous and discrete variable QKD transmitters and receivers (based on electronic and photonic integration technology). At TU/e, QKD systems have been developed to run the required full signal processing chain in real-time at relatively high secret key rates. The testbed evaluates these QKD systems together with PQC for real-world applicable quantum safe communication solutions and investigates their integration with classical communication networks.

Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) has established an open access testbed for quantum safe communications where various QKD and PQC solutions are evaluated and tested. Various research activities at TU/e are developing network protocols and solutions for quantum safe communications, as well continuous and discrete variable QKD transmitters and receivers (based on electronic and photonic integration technology). At TU/e, QKD systems have been developed to run the required full signal processing chain in real-time at relatively high secret key rates. The testbed evaluates these QKD systems together with PQC for real-world applicable quantum safe communication solutions and investigates their integration with classical communication networks.

-------------------

**Research project description**


Will you join us in our pursuit towards carbon-free heating and cooling in urban areas? We look for an aspiring postdoc researcher who explores novel ways of using solar energy to achieve that goal.


**Job description**


Although solar energy systems (PV and solar thermal) play a large role in the ongoing sustainable energy transition, the current solutions for integrating such systems in the built environment, are not yet well-aligned with the need for decarbonizing heat supply in winter and cooling in summer.


To help address these issues, this postdoc project will develop integrated solutions for energy harvesting, energy storage and energy savings from both a technological and building integration perspective. The project will combine expertise on both solar technologies and sustainable buildings using an integrated design-driven research approach. Instead of just developing energy components or systems only, in this research project, the energy technologies, building design and the buildings’ energy demands will be equally addressed leading to functional solutions that can be realized and tested in reality. By linking these competences to a network of industrial partners, we expect to work on practical solutions at medium to high technology readiness level.


The project will involve (i) modeling of 3D solar irradiance distribution in the built environment, (ii) feasibility studies on various solar energy technologies, storage technologies (thermal and electrical), and heating/cooling technologies, (iii) development of conceptual system designs, and (iv)prototyping and explorative testing of selected systems.


This postdoc will work between the Building Performance group of the Department of the Built Environment and the Energy Technology group of the Mechanical Engineering Department.


This position and research project are made possible by the BEHeaT program initiated by the Eindhoven Institute for Renewable Energy Systems (EIRES). EIRES facilitates the collaborative development and swift deployment of new technologies and devices by bringing together TU/e researchers working on materials, systems, and processes for energy storage and conversion.  

EIRES consists of collaborating research groups within TUe. These include over 140 researchers and more than 450 PhDs. EIRES brings these researchers together and creates new network connections between researchers and industry.


Within the focus area of energy transition in the built environment, a large-scale research program was recently launched. This program, BEHeaT, stands for **B**uilt **E**nvironment **Hea**t **T**ransition. The program is funded with TUe's own resources as well as contributions from industry. The research program has a pragmatic approach.


Within the BEHeaT program, research is conducted into the (further) development of various (new) materials, components and/or systems in relation to intelligent buildings, heat storage, heat networks and/or electricity grids. The focus is not only on physical materials, components and systems, but also on dynamic (predictive) models. We believe that in order to have impact, any research must take systems integration as its starting point. In addition, we believe that technology does not stand alone and should always be seen in relation to the (end) user. In this way, the impact of research results is increased.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* Motivated researcher, with a PhD in Architectural Engineering, Sustainable Energy Technology, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or a comparable domain.
* The ideal candidate would have demonstrable experience in energy simulation (e.g. EnergyPlus, Trnsys, PVlib), scripting and data analysis (e.g. using Python, Matlab or R).
* Ability to conduct high quality academic research, reflected in demonstratable outputs.
* A team player who enjoys coaching PhD and Master's students and working in a dynamic, interdisciplinary team.
* A proven ability to manage complex projects to completion on schedule.
* Excellent (written and verbal) proficiency in English, good communication skills.
* Independent and responsible.
* Can-do mentality.

**Conditions of employment**
----------------------------


A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:


* Full-time employment for 21 months.
* Salary in accordance with the *Collective Labour Agreement* for Dutch Universities, scale 10 (min. €4,020 max. €5,278).

-------------------


The post-master Engineering Doctorate (EngD) program DEES is a two-year salaried program in the field of technological design in Electrical Engineering. The program leads to an Engineering Doctorate degree.


**EngD project**

Polycrystalline microstructures are widely used for their great tuneability of the material properties. A clear example is the great variation in steel grades, each with a different combination of ductility, strength, etc. These properties result from the underlying complex polycrystalline microstructure. Simulation of artificially generated, 3D synthetic microstructures supports the design of novel steel grades. However, generating these synthetic microstructures is far from trivial. Significant challenges come from the requirements that the crystals should have realistic shapes, their sizes should match a particular grain size distribution, and in multiphase microstructures the volume fractions and morphology of the phases should be controllable.


**Project goal**

The main objective of the EngD project is to design and implement a software tool which is capable of generating advanced polycrystal geometries in support of the development of novel steel grades. Building on earlier work done at Tata Steel, an advanced multilevel Voronoi tessellation approach will be followed. The existing method (in Visual Basic) is to be re-implemented in Python and extended. The software should be modular, have a graphical as well as a scripting interface and should be extendable, so that it may serve as a platform for further development. As a validation, ensembles of synthetic microstructures mimicking real materials will be generated, which will then be compared on a statistical basis with the real microstructures.


**Company sponsor**


In association with the Materials innovation institute M2i, Tata Steel will actively support the EngD project and provide knowledge on steel microstructures. The results will also be directly used by Tata Steel to study future (green) steel grades.


**Department of Mechanical Engineering**


The department of Mechanical Engineering (ME) is one of the nine departments of TU/e and has been a core part of the university since TU/e was founded in 1956. The mission of ME is to carry out long term, generic, world-class research within the mechanical engineering domain on topics that match the technological interests of the high-tech, internationally oriented industry in the Netherlands. Our education and research programs balance fundamental and application aspects, aiming at providing industry with scientifically educated and application-driven engineers who are optimally equipped to address future challenges.


**Mechanics of Materials section**


The section Mechanics of Materials is one of nine sections within the department of Mechanical Engineering. Its scientific research activities consist in developing experimental analysis, theoretical understanding and predictive modelling for problems in materials engineering. Our projects typically have a multi-scale nature, connecting application-scale material properties to the physics and mechanics of the underlying microstructure. We have an excellently equipped experimental Multiscale Laboratory as well as a state of the art high-performance computing infrastructure.


**Job requirements**
--------------------


Candidates for the EngD position should have a Master’s degree in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, Applied Physics, Mechanical Engineering, or a cognate discipline, with excellent grades and well-developed analytic skills. A background in software development using Python is essential and some familiarity with Visual Basic is recommended. Candidates should be fluent in spoken and written English.


**Conditions of employment**
----------------------------


A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an international setting with a close relationship to industry. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:


* Full-time employment for two years.
* Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the *Collective Labour Agreement* for Dutch Universities, scale TOIO (€2,715).
* A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
* To support you during your EngD and to prepare you for the rest of your career, you will have free access to a personal development program for EngD trainees.
* An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
* An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
* A Staff Immigration Team and a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) for international candidates.

### **Job description**


For children with heart disease, sufficient physical activity is critical for their physical and mental health, and overall quality of life. However, many of these children remain insufficiently active due to a variety of complex and individualized factors, including low self-efficacy and parental overprotection. Addressing these challenges requires a transdisciplinary and systems approach that involves the children, their parents, and their environment.  

  

Convergence Healthy Start is a collaborative initiative between Erasmus University, Delft Technical University, and Erasmus MC, dedicated to addressing the early-life origins of disparities in health and well-being through innovative, transdisciplinary partnerships. This postdoctoral project is port of our team's ambition to enhance the physical activity of children with heart disease by using personalized eHealth interventions in a home-based setting. Our transdisciplinary team includes paediatric cardiologists, social scientists, exercise scientists, industrial designers, and engineers. We are seeking a dedicated Postdoctoral Researcher with expertise in data personalization and eHealth interventions to join us in this mission.  

  

The successful candidate will:


* Collect and interpret data from medical records, wearables, and mobile apps to define risk profiles for children with insufficient physical activity.

Utilize data personalization * -a process that involves analysing and interpreting large datasets to develop customized physical activity plans tailored to the unique needs of each child.
* Further develop personalized interventions initiated by the team's PhD students, in co-design with healthcare professionals, designers, social scientists, and families of children with heart disease.
* Publish research findings in high-impact journals and present at scientific conferences.
* Contribute to grant writing and securing funding for ongoing and future research projects.

  

  

If you are passionate about using eHealth and data personalization to help children with heart defects lead more active and healthier lives, we would love to hear from you! Join our innovative transdisciplinary team and make a meaningful impact.


  
### **Work environment**


The Convergence Program fosters a dynamic ecosystem for research and innovation in South Holland, attracting significant national and international attention. As a postdoc in this program, you will be formally based in the pediatric cardiology division of Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, while also collaborating extensively with TU Delft and Erasmus University. This provides a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of cutting-edge medical research, engineering, and social sciences.

You will perform the research as part of a multidisciplinary team involving two social scientists (both at the Utwente) and two legal researchers (from the VU Amsterdam), that all have a long track record on research around smart home technology.



You will co-design and execute data-collection through interviews and a questionnaire study, analyse the data, and aid in writing up the findings in a journal publication.



You will be located in the section of Psychology of Conflict, Risk and Safety, that has a strongly growing expertise on the topic of privacy, security and psychology.


### **Your profile**

* MSc-degree in psychology or a related discipline (candidates close to graduating are also encouraged to apply);
* Demonstrably good writing skills;
* A proactive, assertive, creative, practical, and resilient attitude towards research;
* Knowledge of and experience with both quantitative and qualitative research;
* Affinity with the topics of risk perception, privacy, and smart home technology;
* Good communication skills and an excellent command of English;
* Command of the Dutch or German language desirable for conducting interviews and questionnaires;

### **About the department**



At the department of Technology, Human and Institutional Behaviour (HIB), we are specialists in the science of behaviour change and the interplay between human behaviour and technology.
  

Why do we behave the way we do, and how does our behaviour change? Why is it that some people can successfully adapt their diet or lifestyle, and others seem unable to? What drives behavioural changes among people and groups? How can our governments help us to behave in ways that are healthy, sustainable and inclusive, or that will make our countries, societies and cities a safer place to live? What role can technologies play – from virtual reality or artificial intelligence to human-media interaction and value-based design – in influencing our behaviour for the better? And, conversely, what does our behaviour tell us about how these new technologies should be developed? These are some of the key questions we deal with as researchers, educators and societal problem solvers at the HIB department.


### **About the organisation**



The Faculty of Behavioral, Management and Social sciences (BMS) aims to play a key role in understanding, jointly developing and evaluating innovations in society. Technological developments are the engine of innovation. As a technical university that puts people first, we tailor them to human needs and behavior and use social engineering to integrate them into society. We also ensure adequate governance at public and private level, and robust, inclusive and fair organizational structures. We do this by developing, sharing and applying high-quality knowledge in Psychology, Business Administration, Public Administration, Communication Sciences, Philosophy, Educational Sciences and Health Sciences. Our research and education in these disciplines revolves around tackling and solving societal challenges. The research programs of BMS are closely linked to the research of the UT institutes Mesa+ Institute for Nanotechnology, TechMed Center and Digital Society Institute.



As an employer, the Faculty of BMS offers work that matters. We equip you to create new possibilities for yourself and for our society. With us, you will become part of a leading technical university with increasing, positive social impact.

Within the area the various squads are responsible to seamlessly replace the existing local Corporate Banking applications into one single global platform, and to create an Open Banking Layer connecting to the outside world. This all will contribute to the W&R objectives to become a truly client centric bank by enhancing customer experience, reducing costs and operational risks, easing implementation of regulations, increasing efficiency and the ability to innovate. Multiple squads are developing and maintaining the Core Banking Platform and work together in building an accessible, safe and future-proof solution which facilitates standardised and STP processes worldwide with high accessibility for our customers at low costs.

* **Collaboration**: Foster a culture of collaboration and open communication, promoting transparency and trust within the team and stakeholders.
* **Obstacle Removal**: Identify and remove impediments to the team's progress to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Encourage a mindset of continuous improvement by facilitating retrospective discussions and implementing action items.

A major current scientific challenge is to accurately predict evolution. However, it is very unclear whether we can predict evolution, and on what factors this depends. This project aims to elucidate the effect of community complexity on the predictability of evolution. An international consortium with members from the University of Amsterdam, Rutgers University (USA) and the University of Alberta (Canada) will set out to investigate the effect of different communities of Candida species on the evolution of antifungal resistance, with experimental, bioinformatics and mechanistic modelling approaches.  


In Amsterdam, mechanistic multiscale models of Candida will be used to study how community structure affects the predictability of evolution. Close collaboration with researchers from the collaborating institutes will link experiments, modelling, theory and data analysis together to tackle this major scientific question.  


This position is in the Evolutionary Systems Biology team of dr. Meike Wortel. The team focusses on developing mathematical and computational techniques to include the environment, including other species, in the analysis of evolutionary trajectories and apply this to antibiotic resistance evolution and microbial communities. To achieve this, the team combines evolutionary approaches with systems biology, which links the intricate networks that make up cells to their overserved behavior at the cell level.  


The team is embedded in the Microbiology Cluster of the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences and affiliated with interdisciplinary collaborations in Systems Biology and research on Origin and Evolution of Life and Emergence. The team uses ongoing collaborations to link theory directly to experimental systems.  

  

**What are you going to do?**  

  

Your role withing the project will be to develop computational models and theory to understand how community complexity influences the predictability of evolution. You are expected to bring your own expertise and ideas and collaborate with the PI and the collaboration groups, including being active in (online) consortium meetings, short lab visits and attending international conferences. You will lead the publication of your research outcomes and contribute to other studies within the project. As a member of the Evolutionary Systems Biology team in Amsterdam you will discuss with the other team members, present at the Microbiology and other institute seminars and take part in the supervision of BSc and MSc students.  


**Your experience and profile**  

You have/are:  

* a PhD in Systems Biology, Computational Biology, Theoretical (Evolutionary) Biology or a related field with one or more publications

 as first author in a peer-reviewed scientific journal;  

* experience with metabolic models or in modelling evolutionary dynamics;
* excellent English skills;
* excited to work in an international interdisciplinary team.
  


**Our offer**  

We offer a temporary employment contract for 30.4-38 hours per week for a period of 3 years, with a probation period of 2 months. The preferred starting date is to be discussed, but the project can start directly.  


The gross monthly salary, based on 38 hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 3,345 to € 5.278 (scale 10).

Faculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science


The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position. In total, more than 1000 employees and 4,000 students work and study in this innovative environment.

You are willing to collaborate closely with both public and private partners on the development of sustainable and fire-safe plastics (polypropylene) based on fully organic phosphorus-sulfur compounds.

  


**Job description**  

This project is part of the SuFiP-S project where two departments of Maastricht University (Circular Chemical Engineering, CCE and Aachen-Maastricht Institute for Biobased Materials, AMIBM) collaborate with Sabic. The goal of the SuFiP-S project is to develop sustainable and fire-safe plastics (polypropylene) based on fully organic phosphorus-sulfur compounds.

  


Polypropylene (PP) is a significant plastic in flame retardant (FR) products in electronics and transportation. Single-molecule FRs like phosphorus-sulfur (P-S) FRs are part of the state-of-the-art research for applications in PP due to their promising FR performance at low concentrations. However, P-S FRs are not commercially used because their decomposition mechanisms are unknown during processing and in the use phase, thus leading to poor recyclability. This project proposes a systematic interdisciplinary study on the degradation, processing, and recycling of PP/FR plastics to lay a scientific basis for developing new PP/FR plastics and increasing their recycling quantity and quality.

  


The task of the post-doc at AMIBM is to synthesize flame retardants and to investigate their degradation mechanism during processing and recycling conditions via analytical techniques. In a first part of the research, the degradation of pure flame retardants will be studied, later the flame retardant blended in a polypropylene matrix will be the focus. The post-doc will work closely together with a PhD student in the group of dr. Ali Gooneie from CCE at UM. The latter are responsible for mechanical recycling studies and modelling work related to the degradation mechanism of the flame retardants. Flame retardants will be upscaled for the testing by the colleagues from CCE. Based on this interaction, the chemical structure of the flame retardant will adapted in order allow better recycling.

  


The post-doc will be appointed at AMIBM, Maastricht University, which is part of the Faculty of Science and Engineering. You will work in the Sustainable Polymer Synthesis group of Associate Professor Katrien Bernaerts, which focusses on the synthesis and design of polymer materials with tunable properties and recyclability exploiting the functionality of biobased building blocks. You will operate from the Brightlands-Chemelot Campus in Geleen (Nl), where the labs are located.

  


**Requirements**

Full-time · Amsterdam


**About the job**
-----------------



Amsterdam Platform Creation (APC) created Woolsocks, a new fintech super-app in Europe. Our goal is to help people manage their money smarter, save more, and grow their wealth over time. The Woolsocks app is already available in 7 countries and our user base is rapidly expanding. At APC, we are deeply involved in all aspects of this startup as founders, investors, and consultants. Our experienced and talented team contributes to product management, UX design, development, and marketing to maximize Woolsocks' potential.



What is it like to be a product designer at APC?



Your mission is to make it as easy as possible for our users to explore all money saving opportunities in the Woolsocks platform. Given our diverse user base, spanning multiple countries, cultures, and services in one app, designing for Woolsocks presents an exciting challenge. Are you ready to help people save money?


**Full stack design**  

Your job starts with translating business ideas into valuable, feasible and usable solutions. Since we are a small team of only a few product designers, we expect you to engage in the full spectrum of product design-related activities: conducting various methods of user research to collect insights, UX design, visual design and experimentation.
  

We’re looking for someone who is not afraid to get your hands dirty. You’ll conduct research yourself, design user flows, think about navigation, UX writing, different scenarios and error states. You create prototypes to communicate your solutions and apply and maintain the shared design system together with your peers. Your primary design tool will be Figma, and we utilize Jira, Dovetail, Slack, MS Office, Maze.co, and other tools as well.
  

  

**Insights driven**  

Together with the product managers that you work with, you’ll evaluate the performance of your own solutions and improve and iterate towards the desired business outcomes. You practice a “just enough” research mindset, actively gathering qualitative and quantitative user data when needed. This could be in collaboration with our BI analysts, or you do everything yourself by conducting usability tests, sending user surveys, analysing behavioural data and preparing A/B testing to make insight driven decisions.  

  

**Team**  

You will have the chance to work in a small team with high impact. As a junior designer, you will face a steep learning curve. You will get guidance from experienced team members that help you to define your design activities and together with them you actively communicate with developers and product managers to collect feedback, manage progress of the desired design deliverables and iterate towards the best possible results.
  

You will learn how to articulate your assumptions, argument on your design choices and review your own design work to improve it further. Our teams optimize for maximum value creation, striking a balance between pragmatism/speed and quality.



What We're Looking For


* You have 1-2 years full-time work experience in UX design/product design team;

Worldwide, over 30 million people with diabetes are insulin dependent. This means they need insulin to manage their blood glucose levels. They can either give themselves multiple daily injections, or use an insulin pump, which administers insulin on a continuous basis around the clock.

  



At ViCentra, we’re on a mission to design an insulin pump that delivers not just a best-in-class performance, but also gives our users an experience that empowers and excites them. Something a bit different from the usual medical experience!

  



It’s simple really: people with diabetes are people – not patients.

  



Our philosophy is all about simplicity, helping to carry some of the weight of day-to-day diabetes management for the user, adding a splash of colour and a whole lot of freedom! Kaleido is one of the smallest insulin pumps in the world. We have 10 colour combinations, from bright and joyful to sleek and chic. We want our users to wear their Kaleido proudly. Its size makes Kaleido discreet and easy to wear, so Kaleidoers can forget about diabetes (for a while, at least!) and focus on what truly matters - living life on their own terms!

  



ViCentra was founded in 2013 in the Netherlands, and while we still call Utrecht our home, we’ve now branched out to France and Germany, too. We're gearing up to spread our magic even further, with concrete plans to extend across Europe in 2024.

The forecasting team consists of a product owner, scrum master and 6 model builders. The team is international, diverse and daily language is English. You will be part of a warm and professional team where hard working and fun is combined.


Our main office is in Rotterdam next to the iconic Erasmus bridge. We work hybrid with a minimum of 2 days a week at the office, Mondays in Rotterdam and Thursday in Amsterdam.You’re also able to work from other KPN offices and working from home is also supported.

**Postdocs (m/v/x)**


within Peter Grünwald’s ERC Advanced Grant Project FLEX (FLEXible Statistical Inference).


**Job description**
-------------------


Most statistical methods require that all aspects of data collection and inference are determined in advance, independently of the data. These include when to stop collecting data, what decisions can be made (i.e. accept/reject null hypothesis), and how to measure their quality (e.g. loss function/significance level). This is *wildly* at odds with the flexibility required in practice! It is a leading cause of the *replicability crisis* in the applied sciences.


The project aims to develop novel theory and methods of statistics in which all data-collection and decision-aspects may be unknown in advance, possibly imposed post-hoc. Yet the new theory will provide valid small-sample error control and uncertainty quantification. The theory will be based on far-reaching extensions of *e-values*, *e-processes*, and the *e*-*posterior*, flexible alternatives for p-values and Bayes factors that have been developed over the last five years. Other key topics include *anytime-valid confidence sequences, concentration inequalities, martingales* and *the foundations of statistics* (likelihood principle, complete class theorems).


The vacancies are for two three-year postdocs to do research within the FLEX project.


**Requirements**
----------------


Candidates are required to have completed their PhD in mathematics or computer science, with a strong background in mathematical statistics and/or information theory. It is highly desirable that they have previously worked on at least one of the aforementioned key topics.


Needed qualifications for candidates include proven research talent, strong theoretical background, and good academic writing and presentation skills. Candidates are expected to have an excellent command of English.


**Terms and conditions**
------------------------


The terms of employment are in accordance with the Dutch Collective Labour Agreement for Research Centres (""CAO-onderzoeksinstellingen""). The gross monthly salary for an employee on a full time basis, depending on relevant work experience, ranges from € 4.374 to € 5.331.


The appointment will be for a period of three years.


Employees are also entitled to a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year-end bonus of 8.33%. CWI offers attractive working conditions, including flexible scheduling.

**Faculteit/Dienst:** Faculteit der Maatschappij- & Gedragswetenschappen
**Opleidingsniveau:** Gepromoveerd
**Functie type:** Wetenschappelijk Personeel
**Sluitingsdatum:** 1 October 2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13380
We are looking for a highly qualified and motivated post-doc candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience. The position is part of an ERC consolidator grant titled “Towards understanding human consciousness: How internal brain states and environmental context shape our subjective experience”. The position is embedded in the Conscious brain lab, and the project will be supervised by dr. Simon van Gaal, dr. Timo Stein, and colleagues. The conscious brain lab consists of several PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and staff members of departments of Psychology of the UvA and VU university, who all study the neural basis of consciousness, perception and/or related topics (see website for details).  


**The project**  

  

In this project we address the question how fluctuations in arousal shape the build-up of sensory representations and conscious experience of external sensory input. We know that perception and behavior are altered in active (e.g., running) and inactive states (e.g., drowsiness) compared to neutral states. However, these are only coarse and broad variations in arousal state, and we know now that much more subtle and rapid variations in our internal states can be identified. Pupil diameter (and ongoing neural dynamics, e.g. alpha-band EEG power) have been shown to reflect an indirect and continuous “read-out” of arousal, ranging from aroused (e.g., wide pupils) to unaroused (constricted pupils) levels. In this 1 year post-doc project we test how such spontaneous fluctuations in arousal (e.g., as measured by the pupil) affect our conscious perception. The project involves a combination of techniques, such as EEG/fMRI, pupil measures and computational modelling.  


**What are you going to do**  

* Perform behavioral and/or neuroimaging experiments;
* Gain knowledge of the field through literature survey, discussion with team members, and internal lab meetings;
* Contribute to the design of experiments and perform experiments;
* Analyse and interpret results of experiments;
* Present data at local, national and international scientific meetings;
* Assist in teaching undergraduates and Master’s students and co-supervise junior scientists (technicians, MSc/BSc students);
* Write scientific articles.

  


**What do you have to offer**  

You are passionate about cognitive (neuro)science and interested in consciousness or related topics such as perception and decision making. You are a team player and a nice colleague with good communication skills as you will regularly join and present at lab meetings as well as at relevant (inter)national meetings.  

***Your experience and profile***
* PhD in Experimental Psychology, (Cognitive) Neuroscience or related fields;
* Good and demonstrable skills in coding in either python, R, or Matlab;
* Good analytical, writing and presenting skills;
* Good project and time management skills enabling you to meet the projects’ deadlines for finishing analyses, reports and other deliverables;
* Eager to learn new things, high conscientiousness, flexibility, and a collaborative attitude;
* Fluency in English, both written and spoken;
* Preferably in-depth knowledge about the topic of consciousness or related topics such as (visual) perception, predictive processing, attention, and perceptual decision making;
* Preferably experience with data acquisition techniques such as eye-tracking, fMRI, or EEG;
* Preferably experience with neuroimaging and eye-tracking (e.g., EEG and fMRI) data analyses (e.g., mvpa decoding analyses, network analyses);
* Preferably experience with computational modelling.

  


**What can we offer you**  

A temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 1 year (longer in case you prefer a parttime contract). The preferred starting date is between 1 October 2024 and 1 November 2024. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students.  


Your salary will range between €4.492 to €6.148 gross per month depending on your prior experience, on the basis of a full working week of 38 hours. This sum does not include the 8% holiday allowance and the 8.3% year-end allowance. A favorable tax agreement, the 30% ruling, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU) is applicable.  

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment at the Psychology department and specifically the program group Brain and Cognition, we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
* 232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime);


* multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;


* a pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;

We are looking for an ambitious postdoctoral researcher with great interests in microbial ecology of plant-based foods and quantitative microbiology. Our project GRASP – Genomic-driven Risk ASsessment of Plant-based foods – aims to predict behaviour of microbial sporeforming contaminants in plant-based foods to contribute to more sustainable food chains. The sporeforming pathogens *Bacillus cereus* and *Clostridium botulinum* harbor genetically different subgroups with very distinct growth behavior and heat resistance. Critical knowledge gaps exist on the behavior of these subgroups in plant-based foods, while this is key to develop strategies to control these pathogenic contaminants. Hereby GRASP aims to investigate prevalence, genetic diversity and behaviour of these sporeforming pathogens in plant-based foods. This knowledge will be used to develop a genomic-driven risk assessment that will be integrated into a validated user-friendly model tool. The project is a collaboration with the Danish Technical University (DTU). The project at Wageningen focusses on *Bacillus cereus* and the DTU project partner focusses on the sporeformer *Clostridium botulinum*. The project consortium involves multiple industry partners that will share microbial isolates from plant-based ingredients and is funded by Plant2Food (Novo Nordisk Foundation).

If you are passionate about contributing to cutting-edge cancer research and making a real difference in patients' lives, we encourage you to apply.***  

  

In radionuclide therapy, a tumor-targeting vector is coupled to a therapeutic radionuclide to specifically irradiate tumor lesions from inside the body. This approach allows for the delivery of a high radiation absorbed dose to (metastasized) tumor lesions, while sparing healthy tissues. Despite the high potential of treatment, we currently do not know which type of radionuclide is most effective to kill cancer cells and what is its underlying mechanism of action.  

  

Within this NWO funded consortium project UNRANU; ***we aim to unravel the radiobiological effects of radionuclide therapy and contribute to novel production methods for therapeutic radionuclides and patient-specific treatment.***  

  

Your primary task will be to investigate the radiolabeling of tumor-targeting vectors like small molecules and microspheres. This will involve assessing the purity and quality of radionuclides, followed by the radiolabeling of small molecules and microspheres with various radionuclides for cancer treatment. You will also play a key role in developing vectors such as microspheres and small molecules, optimizing radiolabeling procedures, conducting quality control and stability tests, and managing radioisotope waste.  

  

Effective collaboration is essential for this role, particularly with researchers involved in radioisotope production at Delft University of Technology, and those utilizing the radiolabeled vectors for internal radionuclide therapy in tumor cell and animal models at Radboudumc and Erasmus Medical Center.  

  

**Tasks and responsibilities:*** Investigate purity and quality of radionuclides.
* Radiolabel to several vectors like small-molecules, DTPA and microspheres with different radionuclides.
* Optimize vectors, including small molecules and various microspheres that can be labeled with radioisotopes or directly activated by neutrons in a research reactor, to improve radiolabeling efficiency. Additionally, investigate the radiolabeling percentage, shelf life of the formulation, stability in saline, blood, and serum, as well as waste products and other related factors.
* Investigate the stability, biodistribution of the vector-radionuclide constructs in biological models (cell-lines, organoids and mice tumor models).

**What we offer you:**  

We offer you the opportunity to work within a large consortium and maintain close connections with various stakeholders from academia, industry, and society (e.g. TU Delft, ErasmucMC, NRG|PALLAS, AlfaRIM, HUB Organoids, MILabs, Quirem Medical, RTM, Siemens Healthineers, TerThera, URENCO, Von Gahlen, VSL RIVM, Wetenschapsknooppunt, patient organisations) to plan, discuss, and perform research in a stimulating environment. **You work in both the Department of Medical Imaging at Radboudumc in Nijmegen and the Department of Radiation Science and Technology at Delft University of Technology in Delft**.

 **About Palm engineering**


Engineering at Palm today consists of a team of five engineers with diverse engineering and cultural backgrounds. We are located in Amsterdam and Stockholm, mostly working remotely with frequent gatherings in one of our locations or at off-sites where it is warmer and sunnier ️


The engineering team has been working together since November 2023 so there is still a lot of opportunities for high impact work as well as playing an important role in further shaping the engineering organisation and culture.


Palm Engineering is defined by our principles:



* **Bias to Action:** In the face of uncertainty, we prototype fast and often.


* **Open Communication:** We courageously voice concerns to realign our direction as needed.


* **Passion for Challenges:** We love the problem and embrace challenges.



In order to achieve this we lean on a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing, where curiosity, respect and openness are some of our guiding principles. We truly value diversity and are happy to have our perspectives challenged. And of course, let’s have fun together!

**Our tech stack**

* **Data Pipelines:** Python, BigQuery
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Cloud:** GCP
* **Version Control:** Git
* We are continuously iterating and exploring technologies as we go - so there’s more to come!

**How will you make an impact?**


After receiving a strong customer response of our data-intensive features, we now want to elevate them to the next level. In this role, you will be responsible for setting up the foundation for Palm's data infrastructure, collaborating with our ML engineer to deploy ML models and data pipelines to production, developing internal tools for various stakeholders to interact with data, and building infrastructure to monitor and improve performance. You’ll likely bring in new technologies to accomplish this.


Your role will involve close collaboration with engineers, designers, and founders (who bring expertise from Fintech & Treasury) to determine how Data can best serve Palm’s customers.

**Our wish list**


We are looking for a proactive and eternally curious person with a love for learning new things. The successful candidate will have experience maintaining production-level ML solutions and possess solid software engineering and ML principles. Strong Python and SQL skills are essential. You will likely have 5+ years of experience in software engineering, data science, or machine learning, including at least 2 years in data engineering or MLOps. We highly value the ability to collaborate effectively, a clear sense of ownership and clear communication. Experience with GCP would be a nice bonus, but it's not required.

 **Benefits of working at Palm**

* **Travel:** Meet all your new colleagues at quarterly offsites - the last 3 were in Lisbon, Stockholm & Amsterdam.
* **WeWork Membership:** Work from home is our go-to - we love spending time with friends and family instead of commuting. We have WeWork memberships for when you want to escape into the city.
* **Stock Options:** Own a large chunk of Palm and reap the rewards as you help us grow the company to a global player.
* **Pension & Health Insurance**: Best-in-class local insurances and pension schemes so you don't have to worry.
* **Wellness Stipend:** 500 EUR in annual wellness benefits - gyms, massages, you name it.",data engineer,https://careers.usepalm.com/jobs/4933795-data-engineer,http://www.palm.com.br,,,,,,,,,,41261f98148dcbf2,,en,,,

You focus on our crown jewels, and ensure that security is constantly improving, amidst IT transformation such as our journey to the cloud, the adaptation of new innovations and the continuous changes in our IT landscape. You contribute to the safety of the bank by securing Azure, but also by looking at the bigger picture. You brainstorm, advise, and work together with our talented platform teams to embed information security at the start of our banking products. Briefly: a constant co-creation and security by design!

We focus on IT security and people security, and work with our IT colleagues to ensure appropriate infrastructure and application security. In terms of hierarchy, there is little to be noticed as we work together in completing our tasks. Working at ABN AMRO means getting even better at what you do. We understand customers, translate their ambitions into common success and earn trust. We want our customers to understand our products. This means that we sometimes turn customers away if the risk of a product is great for them. Customer interest is also: providing a clear product range and communicating clearly. Banking is our profession; the world is our challenge. Moreover, we are socially involved and committed to the ABN AMRO Foundation. For instance, we contribute to giving Christmas presents to the less fortunate and we engage in charity walks. Also, our colleagues are given time to spend working on community projects.

You understand the balance between technical and organisational security measures. You identify IT security themes across our estate and push for continuous improvement. You perform well under pressure and can entice colleagues with your ideas. This means you can easily convince people and transpose technical jargon into understandable language effortlessly.

**Our organisation**



The Royal Conservatoire (KC) and the Royal Academy of Art (KABK) together form the University of the Arts The Hague. The University offers a wide range of art courses to approximately 1800 students. In addition, we provide preliminary training for young students in combination with primary and secondary education. The Academy of the Arts was established in collaboration with Leiden University, where minor programmes, master's programmes and doctoral programmes are given. The University of the Arts is located at two locations in the centre of The Hague.

  



Studying at the Royal Conservatoire means studying at the oldest conservatoire in the Netherlands, where experimentation and innovation go hand in hand with tradition and craftsmanship. It is an inspiring learning environment where international top musicians and top dancers teach. Our teaching and research is about creating, recreating and presenting. This happens together with other organisations, institutions and colleagues in the Netherlands and abroad. The learning environment and professional music and dance practice are constantly intertwined. The courses are based on a strong tripod of education, research and production. At the beginning of 2022, the Royal Conservatoire moved to its new building called Amare, in the centre of The Hague. There we share the facilities with the Residentie Orkest and the Nederlands Dans Theater. Since 2024, the Hogeschool has been part of the European Universities Alliance IN.TUNE - Innovative Universities in Music & Arts in Europe.



Over the past six decades, the Composition Department of the Royal Conservatoire has established itself as the leading Composition Department in the Netherlands. The department enjoys an excellent international reputation and constantly attracts a stream of international students. The team of teachers has been carefully selected, with members who are among the most performed/influential composers in the Netherlands. Although the music that emerges from the department, both from teachers and students, may be far removed from what was once called the 'Hague School', the essential points, the mentality, attitude and philosophy are still strongly linked to the former Hague School principles. Keywords for this department are: collaboration, experimentation, loyalty, trust, involvement, awareness, critical attitude, craftsmanship, innovation, non-hierarchical. The department is firmly rooted in this tradition. Yet she is self-critical and constantly discusses/questions her own core values in a rapidly changing world. The aim of the department is to mentor and train students to become independent, driven artists with a strong awareness of the world around them and to help them develop an authentic voice in music. To achieve this goal, the curriculum is strongly project-based. Students who complete their education at the Department of Composition at the KC are expected to be familiar with a wide range of assignments/projects/collaborations/situations and to be artistically ready to take on any (master's) or most (bachelor's) challenges in the professional field.


**Information and application**



For more information about the position, please contact Mayke Nas, head of the Composition Department, **m.nas@koncon.nl**. We would like to receive applications, accompanied by a curriculum vitae and motivation letter **no later than September 15 2024** via **werving@hdkdenhaag.nl** mentioning the vacancy number: **24-039**. The interviews will take place in September 2024.

  



This vacancy is posted internally and externally at the same time. In the event of equal suitability, internal candidates will have priority for placement in this position.

Worldwide, over 30 million people with diabetes are insulin dependent. This means they need insulin to manage their blood glucose levels. They can either give themselves multiple daily injections, or use an insulin pump, which administers insulin on a continuous basis around the clock.

  



At ViCentra, we’re on a mission to design an insulin pump that delivers not just a best-in-class performance, but also gives our users an experience that empowers and excites them. Something a bit different from the usual medical experience!

  



It’s simple really: people with diabetes are people – not patients.

  



Our philosophy is all about simplicity, helping to carry some of the weight of day-to-day diabetes management for the user, adding a splash of colour and a whole lot of freedom! Kaleido is one of the smallest insulin pumps in the world. We have 10 colour combinations, from bright and joyful to sleek and chic. We want our users to wear their Kaleido proudly. Its size makes Kaleido discreet and easy to wear, so Kaleidoers can forget about diabetes (for a while, at least!) and focus on what truly matters - living life on their own terms!

  



ViCentra was founded in 2013 in the Netherlands, and while we still call Utrecht our home, we’ve now branched out to France and Germany, too. We're gearing up to spread our magic even further, with concrete plans to extend across Europe in 2024.

You probably know us, Action. That nice store where you can buy the craft supplies for the children at an affordable price, load your basket full just before the new school year starts, or score the right tools for that too long delayed chore at home. Did you also know that we have a large HR department and more than 70,000 employees working for us for which a lot of administrative work has to be done? Curious about the administrative work of our HR department? Nice, we are curious about you!**This is your daily action**
-----------------------------

  

  

For our international head office, we are looking for colleagues who can help take care of the personnel administration of the countries where we are now active in, namely: the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, Austria, Poland, Czechia, Italy, Slovakia, Spain and Portugal. Within our personnel administration we work with four teams, each of which is responsible for the HR administration of their respective countries.


The HR administration department is the backbone of Action’s employee management across Europe. Each country team in the department is responsible for overseeing all administrative aspects of the employee lifecycle, from hiring and onboarding to timekeeping and contract changes. In terms of hiring, the country teams are responsible for drafting contracts, verifying new hire information, and providing a smooth onboarding experience, making a crucial first impression on new colleagues. For time management, they ensure that all hours worked are accurately recorded in the system, that salaries are correctly calculated and paid, and that absenteeism is properly registered, ensuring compliance with local labor laws. Lastly, each team manages any changes during an employee’s tenure, such as role transitions or address updates, and handles all related documentation, including employer statements and work permits.**This is you**
---------------

  

  

Helping your colleagues gives you energy and accurately performing the HR administration is a challenge that appeals to you. Action has an international character, which means that you form an international team with your colleagues. It therefore helps if your command of English is sufficient. This way you can discuss the challenges of the day with your colleagues and participate in the monthly international online pub quiz. Furthermore, we believe that the following things will help you:

* Completed MBO or university education, preferably in the direction of HR or administration
* 0-3 years administrative experience
* Good knowledge of English and Romanian
* Do you also speak the language of one of the other countries where we operate? Then that is a big advantage!
**What we offer**
-----------------

  

  

Surprisingly much! From our international headquarters in the Netherlands you have an impact on what happens in our stores across Europe. We welcome more than 15 million customers every week in more than 2,500 stores in 12 European countries. We have great growth ambitions. For Action and for you. Because our growth means that you can always take new steps. A different position, an interesting innovation project, new skills: you can continue to develop as a professional. And all this in a culture where our shared values are truly lived: customer focus, teamwork, simplicity, discipline, cost conscious and respect.


Did you know that you can also count on us for:

* A hybrid work model
* A temporary contract with the intention of offering you a permanent contract in the long term
* 24 days of holiday and the option to buy 5 extra days (based on full time employment)
* 15% staff discount on your purchases at Action
* Travel allowance and work from home allowance
* A company laptop
* Extensive education and training at our own Action Academy
* A good pension scheme and collective health insurance
**How we contribute to society**
--------------------------------

  

  

If you only know Action from the stores, a world will open up for you when you come and work with us. We work hard to make a positive impact on society and the environment. Did you know, for example, that we sponsor more than 2,500 children worldwide who grow up in an SOS Children's Village? That our team reflects the diversity of our customers, including 155 different nationalities? That we purchase 94% of our wood products and 100% of our cotton sustainably? And that almost all our stores only use energy-efficient LED lighting? Yes, that is also Action. Curious about what other initiatives we’re facilitating? Join our team and find out for yourself.**Interested?**

The Postdoc researcher will work in the project ‘The roles of siblings and school peers in young adults’ life-course events’, led by Principal Investigator Clara H. Mulder and funded by an Open Competition Large grant from the Dutch Science Foundation (NWO). The research team will further include a PhD researcher, an assistant professor who will co-supervise the PhD project, and collaborators from the University of Groningen and Statistics Netherlands (CBS). In the project, we aim to identify the roles of siblings and school peers in the occurrence, timing, and outcomes of important life-course events in young adulthood. The events are leaving the parental home, residential relocations, and entry into post-secondary education and the labour market. We will investigate differentiation in sibling and school-peer roles with regard to advantage versus disadvantage, gender, migrant background, age, and time period. We will use register data covering the entire population of young adults in the Netherlands, including newly developed family and school-peer network data, and analyse these data with advanced statistical methods. The results may help combat inequality and enhance young adults’ ability to realise their potential. The envisaged role of the Postdoc researcher will be to work on entry into post-secondary education and the labour market, to collaborate with the other team members on this and other topics, and co-supervise the PhD student. The Postdoc researcher will write scientific journal articles and outreach articles, and will take the lead in the organisation of stakeholder workshops.



Organisation  

The Postdoc researcher will be hosted by the Faculty of Spatial Sciences (FSS), Population Research Centre, of the University of Groningen. FSS is a dynamic faculty with an open character. With approximately 100 employees and 100 PhD researchers, we focus on highly qualified education and research in the field of planning, demography and human geography. With two bachelor's degrees and seven master's programmes, the faculty offers broad training opportunities to around 1,100 students all over the world.

* Publications in international peer-reviewed academic journals in the field of quantitative research on themes related to the project.
* Excellent skills in quantitative research using register data or large survey databases.
* Strong conceptual thinking.

Are you a motivated researcher and would you like to investigate why and how states and other actors employ deception in international relations? Do you have an interest in international relations theory, political communication, philosophy and/or linguistics, and are you keen to combine these interests in cutting-edge and policy-relevant research? Then you have a part to play as a Postdoctoral Researcher on the project ‘Deception in World Politics’.
  
  

The project focuses on the motivations for and processes of deception employed by states and other sub/non-state actors in their foreign policy discourses and behaviour, as well as in international relations writ large. This involves (i) conceptualising the international politics of deception (including, for example, lying, BS, deceptive implicatures, disinformation), (ii) identifying the conditions and structures which facilitate them (for example post-truth politics, digital tools of communication, polarisation), (iii) designing suitable methodologies as well as (iv) describing and analysing relevant communicative processes and behaviours.
  
  

You will conduct research on deception and deceptive communication in international relations, either quantitatively with the help of datasets created as part of the project or qualitatively via in-depth case studies, discourse/content analysis, or other suitable methods.
  
  

You will conduct this research partly independently, and partly in collaboration with the project team, which includes Dr Gustav Meibauer as project lead as well as a PhD candidate who is to start in late 2025. You will write and co-author academic publications together with the other project team members.
  
  

You will help with knowledge sharing and outreach in the project, and help train the PhD candidate in appropriate theory and methods. You will also help create and facilitate opportunities for Master's degree research (e.g. postgraduate theses) within the project, and contribute to departmental teaching/supervision within the range of your expertise.
  
  

Ultimately, the project also aims to identify how policymakers or societies can become resilient to or otherwise combat deceptive communication where it is harmful to democratic governance and peaceful co-existence.
  
  

This postdoctoral researcher position also involves 15% teaching duties (including thesis supervision).
  
  

Profile
  
You have (or are nearing completion of) a PhD degree in International Relations, or any other relevant discipline with a solid background for the study of political communication and international politics.
  
You have knowledge of current debates in one or more fields relevant to this project, for example international relations theory, political communication, linguistics, philosophy (of language), or specific deception, propaganda, misinformation, lying, post-truth politics.
  
You have expertise in innovative research methodologies.
  
You have well-developed academic writing skills.
  
You have demonstrated ability to work in an independent manner.
  
You have an excellent command of English.

The research project is led by Dr Gustav Meibauer, Assistant Professor in International Relations. Gustav has worked extensively on the political dynamics of foreign policy choice as well as on the role of political ideas, rhetoric and communication in decision-making processes. He has published widely on the subject of international relations theory.
  
  

The project, which will also include a PhD candidate (to start in late 2025), will be embedded in the International Relations Chair Group (Prof. Bertjan Verbeek), which consists of multiple internationally recognised staff covering a broad range of international relations approaches and dynamics.

 **About the** **Operations Control Centre (OCC) team**



The OCC is part of our Operations department. The Operations department is responsible for making sure our global operation runs safely and efficiently. The OCC team ensures that all operations in the area are conducted safely and in full satisfaction of our clients. The OCC is split into two teams: one team providing first line support (the OCC Engineers, spread across the Netherlands, Brunei and the USA) and another team providing second line support. That team currently consists out of four Technical Planners - of which two are based in the Netherlands and two in Brunei - and is looking for a new Team Lead.

  

In this role you will report to the Manager OCC.  



  

**Your role as Team Lead Operations Support**



As Team Lead Operations Support you will manage the second line support team within the OCC. You lead, coach and manage a team of four Technical Planners. The job of a Technical Planner is to make sure that our Gangway Operators (who are deployed offshore) have access to all necessary information and tools to execute maintenance jobs to the Ampelmann system. Secondly, the Technical Planners support the Operations Project Managers and Maintenance Technicians with the preparation and execution of open tasks on the assets. As Team Lead, you ensure – together with your Technical Planners – that all Operations Support activities are executed in a timely manner and according to our quality standards.



You keep an overview of open work items, track metrics and create reports so you can keep all your stakeholders informed, both internal and external. You are also responsible for creating an environment in which the maintenance jobs are carried out safely and you identify risks and anomalies, which you escalate to management if necessary. Zooming out, you make sure the Operations Support process ties in with the larger OCC and Maintenance strategy and drive a mindset of continuous improvement, constantly looking for ways to improve work processes and optimize the use of the ERP system (Microsoft Dynamics 365).

 **Regular activities**


* Manage the day-to-day operation of the Operations Support team; e.g. leading stand-ups, monitoring progress of tasks, setting priorities, stepping in where necessary.
* Execute the full performance management cycle with your team members: from regular 1-on-1s to setting OKRs and doing year-end appraisals.
* Monitor and report on progress of team’s activities via dashboards and filtering in ERP system to relevant stakeholders.
* Collaborate with other departments such as regional Maintenance and Operations teams, Supply Chain Management and the ERP team.
* Identify, develop and gather the resources necessary to continuously improve the team’s processes, services and safe execution of tasks.

  

**We ask**


* Bachelor’s degree (HBO) in engineering or technology (preferred) and > 5 years relevant working experience
* Experience with, or motivated to, leading a global team
* Experience with training, teaching and coaching of (more junior) team members
* Good technical knowledge (e.g. understanding of hydraulics, electronics, mechanics)
* Good understanding of ERP systems, preferably Microsoft Dynamics 365
* Excellent communications skills in English

  

**You get**


* A great work environment with innovative and change-willing aspirations
* High degree of responsibility and room to have significant impact
* Monthly gross salary between EUR 3.860 and EUR 5.000 based on experience
* Good secondary benefits (e.g. unlimited vacation days, annual bonus, Working from Home policy, non-contributory pension plan, and more)
* Ampelmann Academy for all your personal and professional development needs

Your objective is to create such conditions during the various plant growth and development stages, that we shorten our cycles from seed to seed and can better select against physiological disorders/abiotic stress.
You are responsible to conduct literature research, design trials, execute, analyze and report your results to your stakeholders.
You are on top of new technologies and developments in plant physiology and create knowledge on the optimization of climate and cultivation processes. You experiment with various tools (eg. light, fertilization, hormones) and deploy sensors to assess the performance of our genetics (eg. IoT sensors, cameras, photosynthesis).
You work with the different crops that Enza Zaden has to offer. Together with colleagues from Breeding, Biotechnology and R&D Operations you make these projects a success. You also have and maintain a network with relevant specialists at universities and suppliers.
The plant physiology team is a young and dynamic team with room to be creative and bring your own ideas into practice.
Your power
You have thorough knowledge of plant physiology and like to bring this knowledge into practice in controlled (greenhouse and indoor farming) and open-field conditions. You are analytical and solution-oriented with a hands-on working mentality. Due to your curiosity and research mindset, you keep an active eye on both industry and academic advancements in the related fields. You translate information from the external environment into innovative ideas to serve internal goals.
You are an independent researcher, capable of solving problems and reach out to the right people, but also a team player exhibiting a proactive and collaborative approach in projects with a common goal. You are resilient on working under pressure, willing to take risks and focus on project execution. You demonstrate strong values of trust, integrity and respect in your work and interaction with others, aligned to Enza Zaden’s values and principles.
In short, you:* have a Master’s degree in Plant Sciences;
* have knowledge and experience in plant physiology, abiotic stress, indoor/vertical farming and open-field conditions;
* have knowledge on the use of sensors and interpretation of climate and plant data;
* have solid knowledge on statistics and are familiar with statistical software (R or similar);
* have basic lab skills (working safely in the lab) or the willingness to learn;
* have strong analytical and problem-solving skills;
* have strong planning, organizational skills and are familiar with managing projects;

FedEx takes care of our people; they, in turn, deliver the impeccable service demanded by our customers, who reward us with the profitability necessary to secure our future. The essential element in making the People-Service-Profit philosophy such a positive force for the company is where we close the circle, and return these profits back into the business, and invest back in our people. Our success in the industry is attributed to our people. Through our P-S-P philosophy, we have a work environment that encourages team members to be innovative in delivering the highest possible quality of service to our customers. We care for their well-being, and value their contributions to the company.

**Our Culture**

Our culture is important for many reasons, and we intentionally bring it to life through our behaviors, actions and activities in every part of the world. The FedEx culture and values have been a cornerstone of our success and growth since we began in the early 1970’s. While other companies can copy our systems, infrastructure and processes, our culture makes us unique and is often a differentiating factor as we compete and grow in today’s global marketplace.",people operations,,,,,,,,https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/246/fedex-squarelogo-1557862760250.png,,,,1009430590425,,en,,organic,
