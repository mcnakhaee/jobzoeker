**Your Impact**
---------------


As the Product Adoption Senior Specialist, Change Management, you will join our People Services Enablement team as part of the global People function driving the transformation of our core People and Payroll processes through digital enablement.
You will work with our global People and Payroll communities as we transform the way we provide services to our firm members. The digitization of core People processes is one of the fundamental ways we are professionalizing our firm and creating an unrivaled environment for exceptional firm function talent.
The role will focus on the rollout and implementation of the ServiceNow People \& Payroll product, a part of the firm’s ServiceNow platform, to enable our People and Payroll process transformation. ServiceNow is the firm’s service management platform that provides transparency to work, increases efficiency, and streamlines global processes. We have undergone intense growth over the past 3 years with great success. We have made substantial impact by enabling self\-help and laying the foundation for generative AI (gen AI) and digital workflows which in turn has driven more increased demand for this product and projects continued growth.
For the next horizon of work, you will drive the overall adoption of ServiceNow People \& Payroll, lead change management, and support the People and Payroll functions to fully adopt this digital platform. This includes working directly with our global community of process leads to understand and anticipate impacts and implications of this technology on roles and responsibilities, processes, and workflows. You will shape, develop, and execute a strategy for changing colleague behavior and ensuring sustainable adoption of this platform across all user communities during and beyond initial implementation.
In this role, we will rely upon your passion for learning, passion for helping others, and aptitude to test, fail and try to come up with solutions that help our end users. This role has potential to grow – on the People side: to serve as a thought partner for our global HR, Payroll and People Operations teams to best utilize this digital solution and develop effective user support strategies; on the technical side, to get exposure to product development and system design and recommend enhancements to the product to encourage deeper user adoption.
For the first year in the role, the focus will split. One focus will be on implementations to expand to more groups such as HR and Payroll into Europe, Middle East, Africa, and others as prioritized by our People leaders. A second focus is working with our product team, user researchers and designers to influence product design and development to take into account product adoption. In parallel, you will help support an existing global group of global users that has on\-going training, documentation, and digital platform needs. Since ServiceNow People \& Payroll enables most processes in the People function, you will actively collaborate across a broad set of domains and teams.
**Your Growth**
---------------


As the Product Adoption Specialist, you will be a key member of the People Services Enablement team, which operates within the broader People Technology group and collaborates closely with the Tech Ecosystem. This team bridges the gap between process and technology, leveraging digital tools to drive people and payroll process transformation, achieve business outcomes, and innovate workflows. Covering the entire firm member lifecycle—from talent acquisition and onboarding to learning, professional development, and talent management—you may also partner with other People Technology product teams to ensure seamless integration and support.
In addition to this, you will work closely with the ServiceNow Center of Excellence and Innovation (CoEI), which unifies digital capabilities across the firm, and collaborate with Tech Ecosystem resources like user research and design to ground your change management plans in user insights and thoughtful design.
In this role, you will focus on driving adoption and engagement with the ServiceNow People \& Payroll platform across a globally distributed team in Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Poland, Spain, and the United States. You will design and execute change management plans for global implementations, develop and deliver tailored training programs, and create communication strategies with supporting materials to engage stakeholders. Acting as an expert and advocate for the system, you will provide ongoing coaching to champion user groups, offer guidance to individual users and teams, and address process gaps through digital solutions.
Lastly, you will monitor user metrics to inform strategies, stay updated on product enhancements, and lead efforts to adopt new features, ensuring the platform evolves to meet user needs effectively.

In this thesis, you will generate synthetic training data by transforming low\-poly 3D models of hands and feet into photorealistic images with labeled key points.

**Areas of Interest:** Generative AI, Controllable Image Generation, Few\-shot Learning


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


The examination of Parkinson’s symptoms is highly labor\-intensive, as it requires multiple trained neurologists to thoroughly analyze hand and leg movements. A group of hospitals aims to extend Parkinson’s treatment in the Netherlands to regions where such care is currently unavailable due to a shortage of trained neurologists. To achieve this, they want to make a pre\-selection through the help of AI on a smartphone. Part of the solution is a pose estimation model to track hand and foot movements. However, the current dataset for training the model is neither large nor diverse enough. The goal is to enrich the dataset with highly varied data while minimizing the need for manual effort.


Important features for detecting hands and feet could be better balanced by enriching the training dataset with synthetic data. To prevent manual labeling of the training data, it would be ideal if the ground truth for tracking key points is synthesized along with the training images. By converting low\-poly 3D models with key point rigs into photorealistic images, a synthetic dataset of labeled training images could be generated. Your task will be to investigate how to transform low\-poly models into photorealistic images using AI.

**The Assignment**
------------------


You will create a training dataset consisting of low\-poly 3D body rigs, focusing on the hands and feet. Next, you will explore transforming these low\-poly models into photorealistic images using a pix2pix GAN model. You may also fine\-tune the model to optimize hyperparameters for generating the best results. Your findings will be documented in a thesis and presented during your thesis defense.

**About us**

Although we take more photos now than ever, we seldom print them out. This neglects all the beautiful captured moments, as among these numerous photos lie precious memories worth printing. Be it the first pictures of your newborn, your niece or nephew, the amazing city trip with friends, or a fun night out.

With klikkie, we help you celebrate life and cherish memories. We aim to inspire you to make time for small moments and enjoy the present – what truly matters. Every month brings new moments, and it's a shame to forget them. Hence, the idea is to enable everyone to print high\-quality photos with minimal effort, month after month.
