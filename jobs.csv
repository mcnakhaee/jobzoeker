The Postdoc will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.  

The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and one Postdoc, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).

* Supervise RA’s and PhD’s working on the project;
* Draft pre-registrations and submit ethics reviews.
* Conduct data-analysis and prepare results for publications;
* Draft articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals;

Contribute to the Connected Minds Lab and the wider scientific community through collaborations, workshops, presentations/talks, attending conferences.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**The program**

**Assistance and Advisory Service (AAS)**



The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) is NATO's principal C3 capability deliverer and CIS service provider. It provides, maintains and defends the NATO enterprise-wide information technology infrastructure to enable Allies to consult together under Article IV, and, when required, stand together in the face of attack under Article V.



To provide these critical services, in the modern evolving dynamic environment the NCI Agency needs to build and maintain high performance-engaged workforce. The NCI Agency workforce strategically consists of three major categorise's: NATO International Civilians (NIC)'s, Military (Mil), and Interim Workforce Consultants (IWC)'s. The IWCs are a critical part of the overall NCI Agency workforce and make up approximately 15 percent of the total workforce.



**Role Background**



The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) located in The Hague, Netherlands, is currently involved in the development and support of new and existing capabilities for NATO.



In light of these activities and in response to the NATO Overarching Space Policy as well as the declaration of Space as an Operational Domain, NATO has organised itself to keep pace with the evolving needs of the Alliance.

**What is the Risk Delivery Team?**
  

  

The Risk Delivery Team is not your typical Oliver Wyman team. For a start, we focus on implementation rather than strategy. And we have big ambitions to change the way people think about implementation consulting.

Our culture is what sets us apart and it's going to help us realize our goal of creating a team of implementation superheroes.
  

  

Some more detail: we're a relatively new team - formed in 2023 in Amsterdam, Milan and Newcastle. And we do meaningful work that makes a real difference to clients. We optimize credit-risk models and processes to solve complex problems for leading banks and financial institutions. Here are some examples of the type of work we do:
  

  

1. Developing a new Advanced Internal Rating-Based Approach (AIRB) credit risk model for the Mortgages portfolio of a G-SIB
  

  

2. Leading the end-to-end implementation of a new credit decisioning process
  

  

3. Orchestrating complex regulatory programs in the area of credit risk (e.g. IFRS9)
  

  

**What you will do**
  

  

* Internships at Oliver Wyman provide a true taste of life as a consultant and unique preparation for a full-time role.

  

* During your internship, you'll work on challenging projects that have a significant impact on our clients

We are looking for a motivated postdoctoral researcher with an interest and expertise in building computational models of body representation, technological augmentation, and embodiment. The goal of the project is to uncover the neurocognitive principles underlying the embodiment of finger-extending exoskeletons. To what extent do internal representations of the body and technology (e.g. exoskeletal fingers) fuse into a single representation? To make headway on answering this fundamental question, we will use a variety of neuroscientific approaches (behaviour and M/EEG) and analytical tools (computational modelling, machine learning).
  
  

**You will be part of the NOW VIDI Grant ’Human 2.0:** A neurocognitive framework for upgrading the body’. As a postdoctoral researcher, you will design novel behavioural and neuroimaging paradigms (EEG) to measure internal representations of the body and tools (specifically, finger-extending exoskeletons), as well as their fusion. In this project, we endeavour to understand the fusion process at a neurocomputational level. You will apply Bayesian modelling to behavioural data to characterise the somatosensory and multisensory transformations underlying fusion. You will then use machine learning approaches to identify neural signatures of their implementation in EEG signals. The overall goal of these experiments is to gain a better understanding of the embodiment of technology at a computational and neural level. There will be close collaboration with other members of the team, including colleagues throughout the Donders Institute. Project management and mentoring (MSc and BSc) will also be part of your responsibilities.

***Passionate about the scientific analysis of Cultural Heritage? Join us in building the next generation X-ray instrument for art and archaeology!***


Job description


The most advanced X-ray based techniques are availble at synchrotron radiation sources, such as the ESRF in Grenoble or DESY in Hamburg. Access to these extremely bright sources is limited, and Dutch researchers are in a disadvantageous position as the Netherlands are not directly involved in any of these centres of research. The Smart\*Light project (https://interregvlaned.eu/en/smart-light-2-0/) aims to make advanced X-ray analysis techniques available in the Netherlands. Several institutes in The Netherlands (TU Delft, TU Eindhoven, DIFFER) and Flanders (UAntwerpen, UGent) collaborate to develop a compact instrument that comprises an intense and energy-tunable X-ray source, X-ray optics and detectors. The source is based on the Inverse Compton Effect, where visible laser light, scattered by a relativistic electron beam, is promoted into the X-ray range, yielding a brilliant, coherent X-ray beam with a narrow bandwidth.



Your main task will be to build and commission the experimental endstation of Smart\*light. This endstation is meant for a characterisation of the beam and proof of principle experiments with a focus on cultural heritage objects (art objects or archaeological objects). This involves testing different components in the laboratory with X-ray tubes, verify their integration into the control software, determine spectroscopic figures of merit, optimize the instrument and demonstrate its capabilities in the first experiments. Based on the early experiments you will be involved in the planning of future Smart\*Light upgrades, especially regarding optics and beam shaping.



This work will be done within the team of the Alfeld Lab at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering of the Delft University of Technology. The Department of Materials Science is a diverse institution, working in small laboratories, headed by independent PIs on a range of topics, including optimising steel microstructure, corrosion, recycling and the investigation of cultural heritage. The Alfeld Lab is working on the multi-modal investigation of cultural heritage, with a special focus on X-ray investigations and the development of new instruments and data evaluation approaches.



You will work with the PI of the group, M. Alfeld, on the Smart\*Light endstation in the lab in Delft and with the team of the TU/e on the installation of the endstation in Eindhoven. It is possible to supervise Master students during the project and to pursue independent research endavours related to spectroscopy and/or cultural heritage.


Requirements


* You have experience in the operation and configuration of X-ray instruments for spectrometry, diffraction, imaging or similar techniques.
* You need to have a PhD in science (preferrably physics or chemistry) or engineering (materials science).
* You can work independently in an interdisciplinary environment with multiple stakeholders.
* You have at least moderate programming skills in python or the readiness to acquire these during the project.
* You have a good command of the English language, as you will be working in an international environment, and preferably of Dutch.
* You do not need to have worked with cultural heritage before, but it is a definite bonus.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



From 1 September next, a salary increase of 3.7% applies due to a Collective Agreement amendment, followed by an additional 1% increase on 1 January 2025. In addition, most employees employed on 1 September 2024 will receive a one-off payment of €300 gross based on full-time employment.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for a:  

  

**Postdoc on Causal Machine Learning for Spatio-temporal Datasets**


The Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) is looking for an excellent Postdoc researcher (1.0 FTE) with a background in Computer Science (or a closely related field) to join a project focused on developing an advanced machine learning framework for spatio-temporal datasets. The position is for 4 years and is partially funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) through the Aspasia premium awarded to dr. Mitra Baratchi for her research on machine learning for spatio-temporal data. The successful applicant will be embedded in the Spatio-temporal data Analysis and Reasoning (STAR) and the Automated Design of Algorithms (ADA) research groups and collaborate with researchers at the Natural Computing (NACO) and the Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) Research Groups. Moreover, there are plenty of opportunities for interaction and collaboration with other groups at the institute and internationally.  

  

The research project is broadly focused on automated intervention design. An intervention is any external interference in an ongoing process that is performed to achieve a particular outcome. Being able to answer interventional questions automatically will help decision-makers solve complex challenges (i.e., reducing methane emissions or reducing the infection rate during a pandemic). Most machine learning algorithms designed for spatio-temporal data do not allow assessing the impact of interventions without capturing causal links. At the same time, configuring causal machine learning algorithms is extremely difficult, being an unsupervised learning task. In this project, we aim to design algorithmic solutions (e.g., new Automated Machine Learning approaches) for automatic and scalable assessment of interventions based on observational spatio-temporal datasets generated by modern sensing technologies (e.g., IoT sensors, mobile devices, Earth observations).

 **Key Responsibilities**


Within this position, it is expected that you will:

* conduct research within the scope of the project leading to peer-reviewed publications in journals and conference proceedings;
* collaborate closely with dr. Elena Raponi (the Natural Computing Group) and dr. Saber Salehkaleybar (the Explanatory Data Analysis Group) at LIACS;
* engage in teaching activities of the STAR Research Group and supervision of BSc and MSc students;

 **Selection Criteria**


We are looking for a candidate with expertise or experience with one or more of the following topics: machine learning for spatio-temporal data, causal machine learning (casual discovery and causal inference), and automated machine learning.

* holding (or close to acquiring) a PhD degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence or a closely related field;
* strong research vision and an academic mindset;
* strong publication record;
* being able to collaborate with scientific peers inside and outside your own research area;
* strong programming skills in Python or other programming languages;
* excellent proficiency and communication skills in English;
