Onsite
Netflix is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with 278 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

 **The Role**


Our mission at Netflix is to connect global stories with global audiences. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.


Recently, Netflix has expanded its entertainment offering to include Live content, like The Roast of Tom Brady Comedy Special, the SAG Awards ceremony, and The Netflix Slam tennis match. Our scope will grow to include premium live entertainment with our growing Live content catalogue, including WWE, NFL, and more.


Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips. This is made possible because Netflix UI is a thriving learning machine where Artwork & Video assets are personalized via reinforcement learning.


Europe is a significant center for our broader Studio and Creative Production teams. We’re looking for a Senior Analytics Engineer based in our Amsterdam office to join our growing European team. In this role, you would serve as a trusted partner for regional Creative Production leadership. Given this data & insights rich landscape, we are looking for a highly motivated Senior Analytics Engineer to partner with business teams and product managers to empower how we create Artwork and Trailers. This is an opportunity for you to have direct influence on strategic decisions through technical and business thought partnership that will ultimately shape promotional content.

**As a Senior Analytics Engineer in this space, you will…**

* Be a strategic partner for Studio & Creative Production teams: identify critical analytical problems and apply an entrepreneurial mindset to find innovative solutions with data
* Being the lead analytics engineer partnering with our Product Creative Studio partners who are responsible for the promotional assets for Live content experiences.
* Drive the direction of your work, developing solutions that span from scrappy code and prototype tools to high-visibility dashboards and analyses for Studio & Creative Production leadership
* Spearhead the creation of new metrics that impact decision-making
* Collaborate with Data Scientists & Data Engineers to source data from new systems and strengthen our foundational data models
* Become a regional expert on all things Studio Data Science & Engineering, helping educate and connect regional offices to existing data solutions

**You are…**

* A strong communicator who can develop and deepen strong relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders. You have experience partnering closely with executive leadership, with a proven track record of influencing strategic decisions through data.
* Comfortable with ambiguity; able to thrive with minimal oversight and process. You connect the dots across business needs and independently drive projects forward.
* A senior analytics professional with extensive experience across data wrangling, analysis, reporting, and visualization.
* An expert in a data-oriented programming language (e.g. SQL, Python, R, Scala, etc.) and intuitive dashboard/visualization design (e.g. Tableau)
* Proficient in ETL and data warehousing best practices and core statistics concepts (e.g. hypothesis testing)
* Adept at working across different cultures on a globally-distributed team, with core working hours in the Central European and GMT time zones

**Culture**


You will have the opportunity to impact the business in a meaningful way, working alongside smart people who love to solve hard problems, and who not only expect but also foster high performance. You will have the freedom to innovate, solve interesting problems and influence decision-making in a fast paced, exciting environment.

Where appropriate, design and develop tools & dashboards that enable “unblackboxifying” of complex ML models, broadening the surface area of their impact.

* Metric Design: Spearhead the creation of new metrics to inform decision-making and improve operational efficiency.
* Regional Expertise: Become an expert on all things related to our Data Science & Engineering efforts, helping educate and connect regional offices to existing and new data solutions.


You Are…
* Able to develop and deepen strong relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders and have a proven track record of influencing strategic decisions through data.
* Able to thrive with minimal oversight and process, connecting the dots across business needs and independently driving projects forward.
* Proven experience with ML models and an understanding of modern ML algorithms, enabling effective collaboration with ML researchers and engineers.
* A senior analytics professional with extensive experience in data wrangling, analysis, reporting, and visualization.
* An expert in data-oriented programming languages, including Python and SQL, and intuitive dashboard/visualization design (e.g Tableau). Proficient in ETL processes and data warehousing best practices.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-------------------


In the Geometric Learning and Differential Geometry Group (GLDG) within the Centre for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications (CASA) we invent, apply, and build new theory and methods in geometric AI for automated medical and industrial image analysis. The Geometric Deep learning methods developed in GLDG bridge the gap in image processing between machine learning and traditional PDE/geometry-based methods.


The focus in the group GLDG supported by VICI project “Geometric Learning for Image Analysis” (R. Duits) is on PDE-based equivariant neural networks aiming for impact on industry and society. This requires close interplay between mathematical theory and practical requirements. With implementation running parallel to theoretical development, we ensure that our geometric learning is both well-founded in profound new mathematics and relevant for practical applications.


Key objectives of the position are:


* Develop high-performance implementations of geometric learning methods for modern hardware whileconnecting advanced scientific computing to applied and geometric analysis.
* Establish connections to industryvia joint projects ongeometric learning and image processing**,** while investing in in-house implementations to keep our research relevant for industry.

* Be active in funding acquisition and set up a clear, personal, and visible research line that fits the overall activities and strategy in the GLDG group and CASA cluster.
* Open the black box of deep learning via geometric interpretability and explainable AI. Promising results are growing and allow for clear analysis by experts, but intuitive visualization and interpretation tools to industrial/health tech partners raise challenges to be tackled.
* Design new equivariant PDE-based neural networks**.** Current methods in GLDG reveal drastic network reduction, and training data-reduction with better performances. Pursue a research direction in explainable and transferable geometric AI. Analysis of topological transitions, semi-ring co-domain extensions, Lie group domain extensions require new models.
* Connect to the GLDG group, the CASA cluster, and the M&CS department at TU/e, and act in cross-divisional institutes such as EAISI**,** to guarantee a vibrant, well-embedded and well-funded research group with better network design and image analysis applications.

**We’re hiring a Cloud Engineer (AWS) to join the Smart Sorting Platform Team!**

###### **Description**


Prime Vision’s Intelligence department is the backbone of most systems delivered to our customers. By handling sorting center and equipment definitions, orchestrating coding flows, executing and retrieving OCR requests, and communicating with customer backend systems locally and in the cloud, the Intelligence department has first-hand production experience in the postal and parcel domain. With the most experienced software engineers in the company, our sorting system helps our customers simplify and centralize their sorting process while guaranteeing high throughput in the cloud. We need a talented engineer passionate about evolving cloud technologies who can pick up AWS skills and backend TypeScript programming to join our team and drive our mission-critical platform forward.

###### **Your job**


As a Cloud Engineer (AWS) Engineer, you will be pivotal in making our AWS setup reliable, repeatable, and highly performant. You will be designing and implementing observability practices to increase fault tolerance in a distributed system, and you will learn to address millions of requests in a Serverless Lambda architecture. You will collaborate closely with the Smart Data Manager to implement efficient business rules. Further, you will discuss with the Smart Analytics team how to make sense of the data post-sorting. The Smart Sorting Platform you will help professionalize is the workhorse that must respond with correct sorting decisions within milliseconds, allowing Prime Vision to then digest the data for analysis and come up with more optimized logistical processes at national scales.

**Specific Responsibilities**:

* Design and implement serverless applications using AWS services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, EFS, and S3. We will later make the system cloud-agnostic.
* Develop and integrate advanced logic into our sorting processes to improve efficiency and accuracy.
* Build unit and integration tests for added logic that you build.
* Build and update CDK stacks for parts of the platform for testing and deployment purposes.
* Optimize and enhance existing sorting flows to ensure robustness and high performance.
* Ensure best practices in security, performance, and reliability are followed throughout the development process.
* Troubleshoot and resolve API-related issues promptly.
* Document designs, processes, and procedures to support ongoing development and maintenance.

**What we offer**


We offer a full-time position in an informal and professional working environment with a lot of room for personal development and many extras:

* First-hand access to customer challenges and a real possibility to positively impact them in their sorting processes.
* A product development team with a pivotal position within the department, with an overseeing Product Owner and clear goals for 2 customers for 2024-2026.
* Opportunities to learn from the most experienced software engineers in the company.
* An open and inclusive workspace with colleagues from more than 20 different nationalities.
* A globally oriented company with an equally global client base.
* A full range of digital tools will be at your disposal.
* Competitive salary.
* Company laptop and mobile phone of choice.
* Extra perks such as snacks and excellent coffee every day in our cozy Grand Café.
* Training sessions by a personal trainer in our in-house gym.
* The possibility to work flexible hours.
* A profit-sharing scheme for all employees.
* The option to purchase additional vacation days on top of the 25 standard holiday allowance.

###### **Your profile**

* Proven experience as Cloud Engineer in any cloud provider. Experience with AWS and Serverless technologies is a big plus (Lambda, DynamocDB, EFS, S3, EventBridge, Kinesis, etc).
* Familiarity and expertise in event-driven architectures. Experience with SNS is a plus.
* Strong programming skills in TypeScript for backend systems. If not previous experience, the candidate should have experience with JavaScript or Python. Experience with NoSQL databases is a plus.
* Familiarity/willingness to learn CDK for deployment and infrastructure scripts.
* Familiarity with other cloud platforms (Azure, GCP) is a plus.

###### **Nice to have qualifications:**

* Knowledge of CICD best practices applicable to enterprises (DTAP environments, automatic quality gates, etc).

###### **Particularities**


In the context of corporate responsibility, Prime Vision as a company is particularly open to applications from people with a disability.

###### **Convinced this job fits you?**


If you are excited about making an already fast AWS platform even faster and want to develop yourself in the cloud and logistics domain, we would love to receive your resume and motivation letter or -video!


The application process will consist of 2 interviews and a Big Five personality test. We look forward to hearing from you.

This 4-year project is financed by NWO and focused on early parenthood and infancy and will be lead by Prof Dr. Carolina de Weerth (Developmental Psychobiology Lab).  

  

Our multidisciplinary team will fill these gaps with sophisticated intervention, experimental, and longitudinal studies on daily life PIPC: baby carrying, skin-to-skin contact, and room sharing. We will determine whether, to what extent, and through what mechanisms easily accessible avenues for increasing PIPC can lead to improved maternal, paternal, and child mental and physical health, both concurrently as well as later in childhood and adolescence.  

  

The project includes collaborators from Erasmus University Rotterdam, Utrecht University, and University of Trento. You will be part of a team consisting of senior researchers, a PhD student, a student assistant, as well as perinatal professionals and parents. You will be affiliated to the Donders Institute for Brain Cognition and Behaviour and the Baby & Child Research Center.  

  

We offer a challenging position in an innovative project within a team of dedicated colleagues. Our collaboration is characterized by creativity, collegiality, team work, and responsibility.

Job description


Autonomous vehicles have been shown to underperform when deployed on conditions that differ substantially from the training conditions, so-called domain gaps. These domain gaps can include deployment in different regions, weather or using different sensors. Numerous domain adaptation methods have been proposed to bridge these domain gaps and let the model operate well on the target data. In this project we seek to find an intermediate representation for data coming from varied sources. By bringing new data into this representation, we overcome domain gaps and are able to train models that are robust to different conditions, also referred to as foundation models. While foundation models have achieved widespread success on images and text, currently none exist for radar data, making this a promising research direction. These foundation models will bring superior performance and allow us to utilize data from varied sources, thus reducing the data collection and labeling costs.



The Intelligent Vehicles section at TU Delft, the Netherlands, invites applications for a fully funded two-year (up to 30 months) Post-Doctoral research position in the area of foundation models for autonomous vehicles. This position is part of the EU Horizon project Cynergie4MIE and in collaboration with the chip company NXP. While the exact task (detection, segmentation) is flexible, it should make use of radar sensors, potentially fused with other sensors. Your results will be published in top tier conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICRA and NeurIPS. For your work you will have access to the compute resources of TU Delft, ranging from personal machines, to shared GPU servers, the Delft AI Cluster that is shared across departments, as well as DelftBlue, which is one of the top 250 supercomputers in the world. Your main supervisor will be Dr. Holger Caesar, creator of the nuScenes dataset and co-author of the PointPillars method for lidar-based object detection. You will receive hands-on mentoring for your career development and help with applying for future research grants, to kick-start your continued academic career.


Requirements


* We are seeking Post-Doc applicants with an interest in performing cutting edge research in an active and exciting research area.
* Prospective applicants should have a strong academic record with a solid background in sensor processing (vision/radar/lidar, sensor fusion) and Machine Learning (Deep Learning, domain adaptation, foundation models).
* Good programming skills (Python/Matlab) and knowledge of deep-learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch) are expected.
* A certain affinity towards turning complex concepts into real-world practice (i.e. vehicle demonstrator) is desired.
* The successful candidate is expected to be able to act independently as well as to collaborate effectively with members of a larger team and supervise Master and PhD students. Good English skills are required.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



From 1 September next, a salary increase of 3.7% applies due to a Collective Agreement amendment, followed by an additional 1% increase on 1 January 2025. In addition, most employees employed on 1 September 2024 will receive a one-off payment of €300 gross based on full-time employment.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

Job description


Autonomous vehicles have come a long way from initial public testing with safety drivers to fully driverless deployments in multiple cities across the world. However, to further improve these vehicles, they need to be trained from ever growing data sources collected by their fleets. Due to the vast cost of storing and processing this data, car manufacturers face the problem that they can only store a fraction of it (storing 1h of data costs about $5000 per year). Therefore new paradigms are needed to reduce the storage and processing cost.



Federated learning is such a novel paradigm that revolutionizes how Machine Learning systems are trained. Rather than storing all data on a central server and training there, federated learning allows us to learn in a distributed way. In the case of autonomous vehicles, this means that every vehicle can perform training steps while the system is idle, thereby saving energy and bandwidth. Furthermore, federated learning is much less privacy-sensitive, since sensor data of faces does not need to be transferred to the cloud.



The Intelligent Vehicles section at TU Delft, the Netherlands, invites applications for a fully funded two-year (up to 30 months) Post-Doctoral research position in the area of federated learning for autonomous vehicles. This position is part of the EU Horizon project Cynergie4MIE and in collaboration with the chip company NXP. You will be one of the first to train modern perception and/or prediction (a.k.a. motion forecasting) algorithms in a federated learning setup and provide an analysis of the pros and cons of this approach. While the exact task (detection, segmentation, prediction) is flexible, it should make use of radar sensors, potentially fused with other sensors. Your results will be published in top tier conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICRA and NeurIPS. For your work you will have access to the compute resources of TU Delft, ranging from personal machines, to shared GPU servers, the Delft AI Cluster that is shared across departments, as well as DelftBlue, which is one of the top 250 supercomputers in the world.

**Vision - Quantum Safe Communications Testbed in Eindhovens**  

Secure communications and networking have become a key cornerstone for the Internet enabling several trusted applications which we take for granted today. For example, services such as digital banking, connected transport, digital medical records, defence, governmental and of course data communications – would be challenging should the trust in modern communication systems be lost. As quantum technologies progress rapidly, the growing capabilities of quantum computers threatens the security and then the trust of current cryptographic technologies and protocols. Preventing this threat requires adoption of quantum safe cryptography in the form of post-quantum crypto (PQC) algorithms and protocols and/or using quantum key distribution (QKD). Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) has established an open access testbed for quantum safe communications where various QKD and PQC solutions are evaluated and tested. Various research activities at TU/e are developing network protocols and solutions for quantum safe communications, as well continuous and discrete variable QKD transmitters and receivers (based on electronic and photonic integration technology). At TU/e, QKD systems have been developed to run the required full signal processing chain in real-time at relatively high secret key rates. The testbed evaluates these QKD systems together with PQC for real-world applicable quantum safe communication solutions and investigates their integration with classical communication networks.

**Vision - Quantum Safe Communications Testbed in Eindhoven**  

Secure communications and networking have become a key cornerstone for the Internet enabling several trusted applications which we take for granted today. For example, services such as digital banking, connected transport, digital medical records, defence, governmental and of course data communications – would be challenging should the trust in modern communication systems be lost. As quantum technologies progress rapidly, the growing capabilities of quantum computers threatens the security and then the trust of current cryptographic technologies and protocols. Preventing this threat requires adoption of quantum safe cryptography in the form of post-quantum crypto (PQC) algorithms and protocols and/or using quantum key distribution (QKD). Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) has established an open access testbed for quantum safe communications where various QKD and PQC solutions are evaluated and tested. Various research activities at TU/e are developing network protocols and solutions for quantum safe communications, as well continuous and discrete variable QKD transmitters and receivers (based on electronic and photonic integration technology). At TU/e, QKD systems have been developed to run the required full signal processing chain in real-time at relatively high secret key rates. The testbed evaluates these QKD systems together with PQC for real-world applicable quantum safe communication solutions and investigates their integration with classical communication networks.

-------------------

**Research project description**


Will you join us in our pursuit towards carbon-free heating and cooling in urban areas? We look for an aspiring postdoc researcher who explores novel ways of using solar energy to achieve that goal.


**Job description**


Although solar energy systems (PV and solar thermal) play a large role in the ongoing sustainable energy transition, the current solutions for integrating such systems in the built environment, are not yet well-aligned with the need for decarbonizing heat supply in winter and cooling in summer.


To help address these issues, this postdoc project will develop integrated solutions for energy harvesting, energy storage and energy savings from both a technological and building integration perspective. The project will combine expertise on both solar technologies and sustainable buildings using an integrated design-driven research approach. Instead of just developing energy components or systems only, in this research project, the energy technologies, building design and the buildings’ energy demands will be equally addressed leading to functional solutions that can be realized and tested in reality. By linking these competences to a network of industrial partners, we expect to work on practical solutions at medium to high technology readiness level.


The project will involve (i) modeling of 3D solar irradiance distribution in the built environment, (ii) feasibility studies on various solar energy technologies, storage technologies (thermal and electrical), and heating/cooling technologies, (iii) development of conceptual system designs, and (iv)prototyping and explorative testing of selected systems.


This postdoc will work between the Building Performance group of the Department of the Built Environment and the Energy Technology group of the Mechanical Engineering Department.


This position and research project are made possible by the BEHeaT program initiated by the Eindhoven Institute for Renewable Energy Systems (EIRES). EIRES facilitates the collaborative development and swift deployment of new technologies and devices by bringing together TU/e researchers working on materials, systems, and processes for energy storage and conversion.  

EIRES consists of collaborating research groups within TUe. These include over 140 researchers and more than 450 PhDs. EIRES brings these researchers together and creates new network connections between researchers and industry.


Within the focus area of energy transition in the built environment, a large-scale research program was recently launched. This program, BEHeaT, stands for **B**uilt **E**nvironment **Hea**t **T**ransition. The program is funded with TUe's own resources as well as contributions from industry. The research program has a pragmatic approach.


Within the BEHeaT program, research is conducted into the (further) development of various (new) materials, components and/or systems in relation to intelligent buildings, heat storage, heat networks and/or electricity grids. The focus is not only on physical materials, components and systems, but also on dynamic (predictive) models. We believe that in order to have impact, any research must take systems integration as its starting point. In addition, we believe that technology does not stand alone and should always be seen in relation to the (end) user. In this way, the impact of research results is increased.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* Motivated researcher, with a PhD in Architectural Engineering, Sustainable Energy Technology, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or a comparable domain.
* The ideal candidate would have demonstrable experience in energy simulation (e.g. EnergyPlus, Trnsys, PVlib), scripting and data analysis (e.g. using Python, Matlab or R).
* Ability to conduct high quality academic research, reflected in demonstratable outputs.
* A team player who enjoys coaching PhD and Master's students and working in a dynamic, interdisciplinary team.
* A proven ability to manage complex projects to completion on schedule.
* Excellent (written and verbal) proficiency in English, good communication skills.
* Independent and responsible.
* Can-do mentality.

**Conditions of employment**
----------------------------


A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:


* Full-time employment for 21 months.
* Salary in accordance with the *Collective Labour Agreement* for Dutch Universities, scale 10 (min. €4,020 max. €5,278).
* A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
* High-quality training programs on general skills, didactics and topics related to research and valorization.
* An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
* Partially paid parental leave and an allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
* A TU/e Postdoc Association that helps you to build a stronger and broader academic and personal network, and offers tailored support, training and workshops.
* A Staff Immigration Teamis available for international candidates, as are a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) and a compensation for moving expenses.

* An open and highly autonomous culture where you are responsible for your goals and encouraged to regularly give and receive feedback
* An informal atmosphere with plenty of room for fun (movie/gaming events, team outings & monthly drinks)

  

The stakeholder field of the ALM Grid mainly consists of the ALM department itself, 2nd line ALM, ALM Risk modelling, Risk Reporting and Model Validation. Also, the data sources delivering parties are important stakeholders. In addition, your stakeholders are also the parties which consume the data to meet internal and external requirements. The final ALM reports, insights and analyses are discussed in senior management bodies like ALCO, BRC and ERM.

**Your profile**
----------------


We are looking for someone with a proactive and constructively critical attitude who is not afraid to tackle challenges head on. Besides a healthy knowledge/interest in complex and analytical matters (which characterizes ALM), you should possess the following skill-set:

-------------------


The post-master Engineering Doctorate (EngD) program DEES is a two-year salaried program in the field of technological design in Electrical Engineering. The program leads to an Engineering Doctorate degree.


**EngD project**

Polycrystalline microstructures are widely used for their great tuneability of the material properties. A clear example is the great variation in steel grades, each with a different combination of ductility, strength, etc. These properties result from the underlying complex polycrystalline microstructure. Simulation of artificially generated, 3D synthetic microstructures supports the design of novel steel grades. However, generating these synthetic microstructures is far from trivial. Significant challenges come from the requirements that the crystals should have realistic shapes, their sizes should match a particular grain size distribution, and in multiphase microstructures the volume fractions and morphology of the phases should be controllable.


**Project goal**

The main objective of the EngD project is to design and implement a software tool which is capable of generating advanced polycrystal geometries in support of the development of novel steel grades. Building on earlier work done at Tata Steel, an advanced multilevel Voronoi tessellation approach will be followed. The existing method (in Visual Basic) is to be re-implemented in Python and extended. The software should be modular, have a graphical as well as a scripting interface and should be extendable, so that it may serve as a platform for further development. As a validation, ensembles of synthetic microstructures mimicking real materials will be generated, which will then be compared on a statistical basis with the real microstructures.


**Company sponsor**


In association with the Materials innovation institute M2i, Tata Steel will actively support the EngD project and provide knowledge on steel microstructures. The results will also be directly used by Tata Steel to study future (green) steel grades.

### **Job description**


For children with heart disease, sufficient physical activity is critical for their physical and mental health, and overall quality of life. However, many of these children remain insufficiently active due to a variety of complex and individualized factors, including low self-efficacy and parental overprotection. Addressing these challenges requires a transdisciplinary and systems approach that involves the children, their parents, and their environment.  

  

Convergence Healthy Start is a collaborative initiative between Erasmus University, Delft Technical University, and Erasmus MC, dedicated to addressing the early-life origins of disparities in health and well-being through innovative, transdisciplinary partnerships. This postdoctoral project is port of our team's ambition to enhance the physical activity of children with heart disease by using personalized eHealth interventions in a home-based setting. Our transdisciplinary team includes paediatric cardiologists, social scientists, exercise scientists, industrial designers, and engineers. We are seeking a dedicated Postdoctoral Researcher with expertise in data personalization and eHealth interventions to join us in this mission.  

  

The successful candidate will:


* Collect and interpret data from medical records, wearables, and mobile apps to define risk profiles for children with insufficient physical activity.

Utilize data personalization * -a process that involves analysing and interpreting large datasets to develop customized physical activity plans tailored to the unique needs of each child.
* Further develop personalized interventions initiated by the team's PhD students, in co-design with healthcare professionals, designers, social scientists, and families of children with heart disease.
* Publish research findings in high-impact journals and present at scientific conferences.
* Contribute to grant writing and securing funding for ongoing and future research projects.

### **About the department**



At the department of Technology, Human and Institutional Behaviour (HIB), we are specialists in the science of behaviour change and the interplay between human behaviour and technology.
  

Why do we behave the way we do, and how does our behaviour change? Why is it that some people can successfully adapt their diet or lifestyle, and others seem unable to? What drives behavioural changes among people and groups? How can our governments help us to behave in ways that are healthy, sustainable and inclusive, or that will make our countries, societies and cities a safer place to live? What role can technologies play – from virtual reality or artificial intelligence to human-media interaction and value-based design – in influencing our behaviour for the better? And, conversely, what does our behaviour tell us about how these new technologies should be developed? These are some of the key questions we deal with as researchers, educators and societal problem solvers at the HIB department.


### **About the organisation**



The Faculty of Behavioral, Management and Social sciences (BMS) aims to play a key role in understanding, jointly developing and evaluating innovations in society. Technological developments are the engine of innovation. As a technical university that puts people first, we tailor them to human needs and behavior and use social engineering to integrate them into society. We also ensure adequate governance at public and private level, and robust, inclusive and fair organizational structures. We do this by developing, sharing and applying high-quality knowledge in Psychology, Business Administration, Public Administration, Communication Sciences, Philosophy, Educational Sciences and Health Sciences. Our research and education in these disciplines revolves around tackling and solving societal challenges. The research programs of BMS are closely linked to the research of the UT institutes Mesa+ Institute for Nanotechnology, TechMed Center and Digital Society Institute.



As an employer, the Faculty of BMS offers work that matters. We equip you to create new possibilities for yourself and for our society. With us, you will become part of a leading technical university with increasing, positive social impact. We offer an open, inclusive and entrepreneurial atmosphere, in which we encourage you to make healthy choices, for example through our flexible, adaptable benefits.",data scientist,https://utwentecareers.nl/en/vacancies/1897/junior-researcher-privacy-risk-perception-in-the-smarthome-at-the-crossroads-of-psychology-and-law/,https://utwentecareers.nl/,Enschede,,"1,001 to 5,000",Decline to state,"Join the university of technology that puts people first.

Our approach to R&D.


This is an exciting opportunity to channel your passion for Innovation in the field of Statistics and Data Science to help shape the future of the Biostatistics function and transform the way in which GSK uses data and quantitative thinking to drive disease-aligned decision-making in R&D. We are recruiting a group of technically skilled statisticians to focus on enhancing disease-level knowledge for the company’s core strategic focus of oncology, immunology, respiratory, vaccines and infectious diseases. Working within our methodological centre for statistical innovation, and alongside colleagues deployed to project-facing programme and asset teams, you will build on existing work to build ‘disease-drug-trial’ models across the chevron of translational medicine and clinical development.


Biostatistics is the single-largest functional group of Statisticians, Programmers and Data Scientists within GSK R&D across the US, UK, Europe and India. Our mission is to put statistical thinking at the heart of R&D decision-making; to ensure that predictive models and well-designed experiments and trials deliver robust evidence as the input to those decisions – ultimately making the R&D process more efficient and increasing the probability of success. We are investing in our cutting-edge innovation capabilities by expanding the Statistics & Data Science Innovation Hub (SDS-IH) led by Prof Nicky Best. The vision of SDS-IH is to be the catalyst for innovation and advanced data-driven decision making.

**In this role you will…**

* *Enhance our disease understanding through the implementation of advanced statistical and/or machine learning methodologies across a range of areas from complex in-vitro models through to market access activities involving real world data to directly support business critical projects.*
* *Identify opportunities to utilize statistical methods to further enhance our disease understanding. Collaborate with cross functional quantitative groups to help determine the optimal analytical methods using appropriate data sources.*
* *Support the upskilling of Statisticians and other quantitative disciplines in statistical methodologies for disease understanding including their direct application in clinical development planning.*
* *Contribute to planning and lead implementation of small-to-moderate complexity projects within Biostatistics, ensuring they have clear objectives, achievable timelines, intermediate milestones, and well-defined criteria for success*
* *Present statistical principles, methods, study designs, and/or results transparently and precisely to GSK researchers and management across all levels, ensuring appropriate understanding and contributing to better quantitative decision-making across drug development*
* *Interact with external scientific groups (industry, academia, regulators) and vendors through presentations, publications, and collaborations, in order to contribute to innovation and uptake of novel statistical methodology and tools within GSK and across the pharmaceutical industry.*

***Why you?***


Qualifications & Skills:

* *PhD in Statistics, Biostatistics, or a closely related discipline (with formal statistical training).*
* *Post-graduate experience in clinical trials research in the pharmaceutical or a related industry and evidence of leading statistical methodology innovation. Individuals with an MS (or equivalent) in Statistics, Biostatistics, or a closely related discipline (with formal statistical training) may be considered provided they have significant post-graduate experience.*
* *Evidence, through publications, of methodological innovation and technical strength in advanced statistical modelling and/or modern machine learning techniques beyond research conducted during graduate studies.*
* *Proficiency in coding languages such as R, SAS, Python.*
* *Proficient in both spoken and written English, with the capability to clearly communicate both new and established statistical methods and results based on those methods to peers without substantial statistical training*


Preferred:

* *Post graduate work experience in statistical consulting, working alongside researchers from various fields to devise practical solutions in response to other researchers’ scientific questions of interest*
* *Post graduate work experience applying a broad array of foundational statistical methodologies, including but not limited to methods for study/experimental design, linear models, generalized linear models, linear and generalized mixed models, survival analysis, Bayesian methods, longitudinal data analysis, and causal inference.*
* *Post graduate work experience applying quantitative methodology in at least one of the following key areas: complex innovative trial design (e.g., Bayesian adaptive design), mathematical and/or computational models for disease processes, analysis of high-dimensional data (e.g., ‘omics data, imaging data)*
* *Knowledge of or interest multiple aspects of drug development, including drug discovery, preclinical development, and clinical development*
* *Experience working in high performance computing environments either for running intensive computational methods or for handling large simulation experiments*
* *Evidence of ability to publish quantitative methodological research or scientific research findings using advanced quantitative methodologies beyond research conducted during graduate studies*
* *Demonstrable evidence of influencing and partnering with diverse stakeholders of varying levels of seniority.*

A major current scientific challenge is to accurately predict evolution. However, it is very unclear whether we can predict evolution, and on what factors this depends. This project aims to elucidate the effect of community complexity on the predictability of evolution. An international consortium with members from the University of Amsterdam, Rutgers University (USA) and the University of Alberta (Canada) will set out to investigate the effect of different communities of Candida species on the evolution of antifungal resistance, with experimental, bioinformatics and mechanistic modelling approaches.  


In Amsterdam, mechanistic multiscale models of Candida will be used to study how community structure affects the predictability of evolution. Close collaboration with researchers from the collaborating institutes will link experiments, modelling, theory and data analysis together to tackle this major scientific question.  


This position is in the Evolutionary Systems Biology team of dr. Meike Wortel. The team focusses on developing mathematical and computational techniques to include the environment, including other species, in the analysis of evolutionary trajectories and apply this to antibiotic resistance evolution and microbial communities. To achieve this, the team combines evolutionary approaches with systems biology, which links the intricate networks that make up cells to their overserved behavior at the cell level.  


The team is embedded in the Microbiology Cluster of the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences and affiliated with interdisciplinary collaborations in Systems Biology and research on Origin and Evolution of Life and Emergence. The team uses ongoing collaborations to link theory directly to experimental systems.  

  

**What are you going to do?**  

  

Your role withing the project will be to develop computational models and theory to understand how community complexity influences the predictability of evolution. You are expected to bring your own expertise and ideas and collaborate with the PI and the collaboration groups, including being active in (online) consortium meetings, short lab visits and attending international conferences. You will lead the publication of your research outcomes and contribute to other studies within the project. As a member of the Evolutionary Systems Biology team in Amsterdam you will discuss with the other team members, present at the Microbiology and other institute seminars and take part in the supervision of BSc and MSc students.  


**Your experience and profile**  

You have/are:  

* a PhD in Systems Biology, Computational Biology, Theoretical (Evolutionary) Biology or a related field with one or more publications

 as first author in a peer-reviewed scientific journal;  

* experience with metabolic models or in modelling evolutionary dynamics;
* excellent English skills;
* excited to work in an international interdisciplinary team.
  


**Our offer**  

We offer a temporary employment contract for 30.4-38 hours per week for a period of 3 years, with a probation period of 2 months. The preferred starting date is to be discussed, but the project can start directly.  


The gross monthly salary, based on 38 hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 3,345 to € 5.278 (scale 10). This does not include 8% holiday allowance and 8,3% year-end allowance. The UFO profile Researcher 4 is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants.

You are willing to collaborate closely with both public and private partners on the development of sustainable and fire-safe plastics (polypropylene) based on fully organic phosphorus-sulfur compounds.

  


**Job description**  

This project is part of the SuFiP-S project where two departments of Maastricht University (Circular Chemical Engineering, CCE and Aachen-Maastricht Institute for Biobased Materials, AMIBM) collaborate with Sabic. The goal of the SuFiP-S project is to develop sustainable and fire-safe plastics (polypropylene) based on fully organic phosphorus-sulfur compounds.

  


Polypropylene (PP) is a significant plastic in flame retardant (FR) products in electronics and transportation. Single-molecule FRs like phosphorus-sulfur (P-S) FRs are part of the state-of-the-art research for applications in PP due to their promising FR performance at low concentrations. However, P-S FRs are not commercially used because their decomposition mechanisms are unknown during processing and in the use phase, thus leading to poor recyclability. This project proposes a systematic interdisciplinary study on the degradation, processing, and recycling of PP/FR plastics to lay a scientific basis for developing new PP/FR plastics and increasing their recycling quantity and quality.

  


The task of the post-doc at AMIBM is to synthesize flame retardants and to investigate their degradation mechanism during processing and recycling conditions via analytical techniques. In a first part of the research, the degradation of pure flame retardants will be studied, later the flame retardant blended in a polypropylene matrix will be the focus. The post-doc will work closely together with a PhD student in the group of dr. Ali Gooneie from CCE at UM. The latter are responsible for mechanical recycling studies and modelling work related to the degradation mechanism of the flame retardants. Flame retardants will be upscaled for the testing by the colleagues from CCE. Based on this interaction, the chemical structure of the flame retardant will adapted in order allow better recycling.

  


The post-doc will be appointed at AMIBM, Maastricht University, which is part of the Faculty of Science and Engineering. You will work in the Sustainable Polymer Synthesis group of Associate Professor Katrien Bernaerts, which focusses on the synthesis and design of polymer materials with tunable properties and recyclability exploiting the functionality of biobased building blocks. You will operate from the Brightlands-Chemelot Campus in Geleen (Nl), where the labs are located.

  


**Requirements**  

The candidate


* holds a PhD degree in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering or related fields;

* knowledge of radical scavenging methods is a pro;
* has some affinity with polymers (polyolefins);
* has interest to unravel the degradation mechanism of the synthesized flame retardants;
* is open to scale up flame retardants for further testing by the colleagues from CCE and Sabic;
* the candidate is expected to stay abreast of the recent literature (publications and patents) in the field of fire retardance of polymers, develop research ideas and valorize the research in the form of research papers and patents;
* likes to interact with academic and industrial partners;

Full-time · Amsterdam


**About the job**
-----------------



Amsterdam Platform Creation (APC) created Woolsocks, a new fintech super-app in Europe. Our goal is to help people manage their money smarter, save more, and grow their wealth over time. The Woolsocks app is already available in 7 countries and our user base is rapidly expanding. At APC, we are deeply involved in all aspects of this startup as founders, investors, and consultants. Our experienced and talented team contributes to product management, UX design, development, and marketing to maximize Woolsocks' potential.



What is it like to be a product designer at APC?



Your mission is to make it as easy as possible for our users to explore all money saving opportunities in the Woolsocks platform. Given our diverse user base, spanning multiple countries, cultures, and services in one app, designing for Woolsocks presents an exciting challenge. Are you ready to help people save money?


**Full stack design**  

Your job starts with translating business ideas into valuable, feasible and usable solutions. Since we are a small team of only a few product designers, we expect you to engage in the full spectrum of product design-related activities: conducting various methods of user research to collect insights, UX design, visual design and experimentation.
  

We’re looking for someone who is not afraid to get your hands dirty. You’ll conduct research yourself, design user flows, think about navigation, UX writing, different scenarios and error states. You create prototypes to communicate your solutions and apply and maintain the shared design system together with your peers. Your primary design tool will be Figma, and we utilize Jira, Dovetail, Slack, MS Office, Maze.co, and other tools as well.
  

  

**Insights driven**  

Together with the product managers that you work with, you’ll evaluate the performance of your own solutions and improve and iterate towards the desired business outcomes. You practice a “just enough” research mindset, actively gathering qualitative and quantitative user data when needed. This could be in collaboration with our BI analysts, or you do everything yourself by conducting usability tests, sending user surveys, analysing behavioural data and preparing A/B testing to make insight driven decisions.  

  

**Team**  

You will have the chance to work in a small team with high impact. As a junior designer, you will face a steep learning curve. You will get guidance from experienced team members that help you to define your design activities and together with them you actively communicate with developers and product managers to collect feedback, manage progress of the desired design deliverables and iterate towards the best possible results.
  

You will learn how to articulate your assumptions, argument on your design choices and review your own design work to improve it further. Our teams optimize for maximum value creation, striking a balance between pragmatism/speed and quality.



What We're Looking For


* You have 1-2 years full-time work experience in UX design/product design team;
* There’s no hard requirement to have a university degree but we do expect a certain level of knowledge, analytical skills and creativity. These boxes are automatically ticked with a completed degree in e.g. Digital Design, Interaction Design or Industrial Design, but without these degrees you are just as welcome to apply and tell us about your skills!
* Portfolio showcasing some real-world problems you’ve solved. No case studies please.
* Excellent command of the English language, both written and spoken, as we operate internationally
* You’re living nearby Amsterdam as we love to work together in our beautiful office on the Zuidas.

**Ideally, you have some of the following skills:**


* Native speaker of Dutch, Spanish, French or German is a pré


**You recognize yourself as:**


* A pro-active, strong communicator
* Although you don’t have decades of experience, you are motivated to learn a lot and you’re looking for an environment with a big challenge, and want work in a high-performance environment.
* You are naturally curious about other peoples’ behavior and ability to create a deep understanding of their psych
* You’ve the ability to thrive in a rapidly changing environment while delivering high-quality work. Maintaining an efficient and structured work approach with a keen eye for detail
* You are a true team player who enjoys designing together. You’re open to feedback
* You’ve learned that product design is not an art but a semi-scientific approach to reach business results.
* Gettings-things-done mindset


We Offer:


* Purpose: Make a difference and help people improve their financial well-being.
* An exciting adventure: Join one of the most ambitious fintech startups in Europe.
* Variety: Woolsocks’ wide variety of services ensures every day is different.
* Close to the fire: We’re a small team directly in touch with the CEO and shareholders.
* Work hard, play harder: We get things done and celebrate achievements.
* Competitive compensation
* Phone and laptop from the company
* Attractive pension plan and secondary benefits

Worldwide, over 30 million people with diabetes are insulin dependent. This means they need insulin to manage their blood glucose levels. They can either give themselves multiple daily injections, or use an insulin pump, which administers insulin on a continuous basis around the clock.

  



At ViCentra, we’re on a mission to design an insulin pump that delivers not just a best-in-class performance, but also gives our users an experience that empowers and excites them. Something a bit different from the usual medical experience!

  



It’s simple really: people with diabetes are people – not patients.

  



Our philosophy is all about simplicity, helping to carry some of the weight of day-to-day diabetes management for the user, adding a splash of colour and a whole lot of freedom!

**Postdocs (m/v/x)**


within Peter Grünwald’s ERC Advanced Grant Project FLEX (FLEXible Statistical Inference).


**Job description**
-------------------


Most statistical methods require that all aspects of data collection and inference are determined in advance, independently of the data. These include when to stop collecting data, what decisions can be made (i.e. accept/reject null hypothesis), and how to measure their quality (e.g. loss function/significance level). This is *wildly* at odds with the flexibility required in practice! It is a leading cause of the *replicability crisis* in the applied sciences.


The project aims to develop novel theory and methods of statistics in which all data-collection and decision-aspects may be unknown in advance, possibly imposed post-hoc. Yet the new theory will provide valid small-sample error control and uncertainty quantification. The theory will be based on far-reaching extensions of *e-values*, *e-processes*, and the *e*-*posterior*, flexible alternatives for p-values and Bayes factors that have been developed over the last five years. Other key topics include *anytime-valid confidence sequences, concentration inequalities, martingales* and *the foundations of statistics* (likelihood principle, complete class theorems).


The vacancies are for two three-year postdocs to do research within the FLEX project.


**Requirements**
----------------


Candidates are required to have completed their PhD in mathematics or computer science, with a strong background in mathematical statistics and/or information theory. It is highly desirable that they have previously worked on at least one of the aforementioned key topics.


Needed qualifications for candidates include proven research talent, strong theoretical background, and good academic writing and presentation skills. Candidates are expected to have an excellent command of English.


**Terms and conditions**
------------------------


The terms of employment are in accordance with the Dutch Collective Labour Agreement for Research Centres (""CAO-onderzoeksinstellingen""). The gross monthly salary for an employee on a full time basis, depending on relevant work experience, ranges from € 4.374 to € 5.331.


The appointment will be for a period of three years.


Employees are also entitled to a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year-end bonus of 8.33%. CWI offers attractive working conditions, including flexible scheduling.
