For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to preempt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

Translational research leverages real-world data sets to study how patients respond to cancer treatments. This research often involves integrating complex and non-standardized molecular and clinical data. Clinical datasets, designed to answer specific scientific questions, typically lack detailed data granularity, making exploration challenging. Understanding the clinical data model is crucial to selecting the appropriate variables for analysis.
This project proposes the use of graph databases to overcome these challenges by organizing data into a flexible, multidimensional structure that facilitates easier access and more intuitive querying. Graph databases, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, allow for the discovery of implicit relationships within the data that traditional table-based databases might miss. Through this initiative, we aim to develop and evaluate AI-driven querying techniques using natural language, enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets in translational research.
Responsibilities* Technology Exploration: Investigate various graph database technologies and their applicability to managing clinical data, assessing their strengths and limitations in this domain.
* Data Model Comparison: Compare and analyze the data structures of graph and relational databases to identify the most effective frameworks for clinical data.
* Pilot Database Development: Design and implement a prototype database focused on the standardization of clinical real-world data, ensuring it supports robust data integration and access.
* Natural Language Query Development: Create methods to enable querying of graph databases using natural language, employing advanced AI technologies to facilitate intuitive data interactions.
* Findings Presentation: Regularly present progress and insights during team meetings, ensuring clear communication of developments and challenges.
* Bonus Objective: Develop a user interface that enables easy querying, and effective visualization and presentation of results from the database.


Requirements* Education: You are a BSc/MSc student in bioinformatics, computational biology or a related field.
* Technical skills: Demonstrated strong technical skills, with substantial experience in Python programming. Familiarity with AWS is an added advantage.
* Soft skills: Comfortable with pioneering research and creative processes; scientific thinking and connecting that to technical requirements.


About You* You are passionate about our purpose and genuinely care about our mission to transform the lives of patients through innovative cancer treatment
* You bring rigor and excellence to all that you do. You are a fierce believer in our rooted-in-science approach to problem-solving
* You are a generous collaborator who can work in teams with diverse backgrounds
* You are determined to do and be your best and take pride in enabling the best work of others on the team

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research into monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).  

  

While the team’s main focus is on forests we also conduct research into the role of land use and forest management in greenhouse gas emissions and removals in a broader context involving the whole LULUCF sector, including other land uses. Team members are responsible for the compilation of the national greenhouse gas inventory for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. For this we develop and work with geographically explicit instruments (such as models and monitoring) that can be used to determine the effects of the management or change in land use of forests, cropland, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other land. We closely collaborate with other experts on land use and soil at Wageningen Environmental Research and external research institutes to bring together all required information for the LULUCF monitoring.  

  

We use our knowledge and tools to draw up the international (Climate Convention, Paris Agreement, EU) and national (Climate and Energy Outlook) reports of greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. With our science-based expertise we also support the development and evaluation of climate policy of the Dutch government and European Commission.

Read the 5 reasons why your future colleagues enjoy working at WUR and watch the video below to get an idea of our green campus!

**Omschrijving**
----------------


The Soil Physics and Land Management chair group at Wageningen University and Research is seeking a postdoc researcher in hydrological modelling who will be responsible for the numerical modelling work in project RESTARTIN: “Restructuring and enhancing strategies with a transformative approach for integrated water disaster management in India and the Netherlands”. This work will involve not only the modelling itself, but also the use of high-resolution satellite imagery to assess vegetation water conditions for calibration, the design of land-use change scenarios (eventually with modelling), and interactions with stakeholders and socioeconomic researchers to translate potential adaptation options into practice.  

Your duties and responsibilities include:

+ apply a surface and groundwater model to several regions in the Netherlands (Limburg, Brabant and Holland);
+ assess climate change scenarios and design compatible land-use scenarios;
+ assess the impact of climate change on flood and drought conditions;
+ test potential adaptation options in coordination with stakeholders;
+ some involvement in related educational activities is possible.
**You will work here**  

You will work in project RESTARTIN, jointly funded by NWO and DST-India. Most of the work will be developed within the Soil Physics and Land Management chair group in WUR. But it will be closely coordinated with researchers at IHE-Delft working on detailed risk assessment and socioeconomic analysis. It will also be closely linked with similar activities being performed by Indian researchers in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra. Some travelling to India is therefore expected.


The intended starting date of this position is 1 September 2024.

**Functie-eisen**
-----------------


You hold a PhD degree in hydro(geo)logy, environmental sciences or equivalent. You also possess:

+ strong and broad conceptual and methodological knowledge of hydrology at the soil-water-plant and watershed scales, including relevant numerical models (e.g., HEC-HMS/RAS, SWMM, HBV, SWAT, SHE, VIC, MODFLOW, CATHY, HGS, FEFLOW, DSSAT, etc.), and model calibration/validation techniques;
+ in-depth experience with GIS packages (e.g., ArcGIS, Qgis) and advanced data analysis techniques;
+ in-depth experience with scripting in R, MATLAB, Python, FORTRAN, etc.;
+ experience in scientific writing, conducting research, and a publication record in hydrology;
+ ability to work independently and to take ownership of the assigned tasks, including making independent decisions on implementation details.

Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”



Unique to this job  

We are an international, dynamic, highly motivated team of scientists at different stages of our careers with a strong drive to push research for the benefit of Public Health.

We know what it takes to lead UPS into tomorrow, – people with a unique combination of skills and passion. If you have the qualities and drive to lead yourself then this role will help you to cultivate your skills and take you to the next level. As a part of the internship, you will have opportunity to learn and develop the following business cases:

**Document Indexing (DOCIDX)**


Indexing scanned documents based on an embedded barcode of any type like CODE39, QR... is essential for any later processing, such as storage and retrieval, distribution to other departments or customer, and other back-office processing. We would like you to work on creating a reusable interface to index scanned documents in bulk, easily customizable for any environment and task.

**Package Type Detection (PKGDCT)**


UPS operates a large number of automated package-processing facilities. Not all packages processed have the perfect cube shape and size. We need to detect the shape of the packages (e.g., envelope, regular box, big size, irregular…) so that they are processed with the care required for each type, or even detect warning conditions like broken packages or liquid leaks.

**Job Description:**

Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to pre-empt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

We are the leading one-stop-shop for branded payments, making online recharge possible for anyone, anywhere at any time — whether you or someone you love needs credit for calling, gaming, entertainment or money. This is your chance to join an ambitious scaleup in a state of rapid growth; we’ll push you to develop yourself and help you create a real impact in your role. Put simply: we could write history together.

  

We won’t bore you with a corporate spiel about how we might be taking on the world of branded payments (spoiler: we are).



Instead, we’ll let the numbers speak for themselves: we bring consumers their favourite brands to their fingertips, with over 15,000 products available in every gift card category globally, $70 million in funding (and counting!), 20%+ growth in 2023.

  

We also have a revenue target of €75 million in 2024, we're just getting started with 1.1 million app downloads in 2023, we are counting 5.0+ million active customers, a presence in 180 countries and 25 markets, a team of 150+ employees and 40+ nationalities and 1 person missing — you.

We’re looking for a talented Business Analyst to join our Business Intelligence Team reporting to Nicolas Arrivé. You will work on improving our day to day business with a strong focus on our customers and marketing analytics.

We help the Marketing team in being more efficient with their Marketing spend in acquiring the right customers. We also inform our product and engineering teams in optimising the users experience from discovery to purchases in app and on the web.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-------------------


Join us – we look forward to welcoming you to our Self-Organizing Soft Matter Research Group at Eindhoven University of Technology!


We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Researcher with a passion for quantitative microscopy and physical chemistry of self-assembling materials to join our team to image the behavior of ice-interactive biomaterials on ice with single-molecule resolution. The goal of your project is to develop and use state-of-the-art microscopy tools and quantitative image analysis approaches to discover the physical principles underpinning the activity of novel ice-interactive biomaterials and to tune their interaction with ice to modulate activity as desired.


Key Responsibilities:


* Conduct high-quality, curiosity-driven, original, and independent research focusing on quantitative imaging and super-resolution microscopy of self-assembling materials
* Collaborate with a multi-disciplinary and international team of researchers
* Present research findings at conferences and publish in top-tier scientific journals
* Mentor and support junior researchers in the lab


The formation and growth of ice during freezing, storage, and/or thawing of cryopreserved materials limits the potential of cryopreservation technology for the long-term storage of sensitive materials, such as cells, tissues, and organs. Our group aims to unravel how biological and engineered ice-interactive materials function so that we can create customized chemical cryoprotectants for biomedical and other applications. Recently, we reported sub-zero super-resolution microscopy experiments which allowed us to study for the first time the interfacial dynamics of ice-bound ice-binding proteins at the single molecule level (see PNAS publication for more information). In this project you will build upon these pioneering experiments. You will image the interaction with ice of a novel class of engineered ice-interactive materials at the single molecule level to advance our understanding of how their structure and properties impact their ability to modulate ice crystal formation and growth. In this exciting role, you will work in a vibrant and international research group aiming to advance molecular insight into the working mechanism of novel ice-interactive materials for biomedical applications.

Are you an ambitious bioinformatician with a solid background in omics data analysis and experience in the field of immunology and/or infectious disease research? Then this bioinformatician position is the job for you!



Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”



Unique to this job  

We are an international, dynamic, highly motivated team of scientists at different stages of our careers with a strong drive to push research for the benefit of Public Health.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

In this role you can apply your knowledge of analyzing and interpreting HR- and employee-data in a variety of ways.

  

This role divides its time between the Product Development and Consulting with separate but overlapping responsibilities. Formally you will be part of the Data Team, that is part of Product Development.  



  

The role of Data Analyst has 3 areas of responsibility:


**Product Development (50%)**

  


Collaborating with our data scientist, you will develop data-driven enhancements for our products and services, leveraging our data in innovative ways.

Although we do not actively offer custom data analyses to customers, around 30 enterprise customers per year request custom analyses based on our research, sometimes in combination with their own data. This sometime involves doing an intake with the customer and possibly also an explanation of the findings.

Put simply: we could write history together.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.
