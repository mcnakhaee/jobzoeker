Your duties will encompass technical aspects such as SQL and Python programming, performing Data Quality analyses, and integrating datasets.

-------------------

 **Do you want to commit to a critical challenge and help to shape our future?**


We keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages, and configuration errors.


We are looking for a team member who is driven by technical challenges and the urge to always find better and more efficient ways of delivering services to the customer.  

  

**What will you do?**


In the role as SRE engineer you will combine the skillset of dev teams and operations teams by applying a software engineering approach to IT operations.


To succeed in this role it is important that you are self-driven, exact, analytic, critical and know how to prioritize. You are not only an expert in your field but you also have social competence and understand the business needs. You always challenge yourself and others to improve. You are also open for suggestions from others and can also give your own.


You are a team player and have a hands-on mindset, a strong customer- and problem-solving orientation. You show fast results, and you have demonstrated good communication skills, especially in an international organization. You need to be able to work independently in an international team that meets more virtually than physically.

  

  

**Your tasks and responsibilities:**

**Maintaining Applications to Help Operations and Support Teams**


As a SRE you are in charge of proactively implementing and maintaining infrastructure and business applications. This can be anything from provisioning servers, updating systems, deploying new software, providing pre-emptive maintenance to monitoring and alerting to code changes in production. A site reliability engineer can be tasked with building a homegrown tool from scratch to help with weaknesses in software delivery or incident management.


You must always be looking to improve quality and efficiency and cut costs.

**Fixing Support Escalation Issues**


Similarly to the point above, a site reliability engineer can be expected to spend time fixing support escalation cases.

**Optimizing On-Call Rotations and Processes**


More times than not, site reliability engineers will need to take on-call responsibilities and improve system reliability through the optimization of on-call processes. You will help add automation and context to alerts – leading to better real-time collaborative response from on-call responders. Additionally, you will update runbooks, tools and documentation to help prepare your on-call team members for future incidents.

**Documenting “Tribal” K****nowledge**


As you gain exposure to systems in both staging and production, as well as all technical teams, you will take part in work with software development, support, IT operations and on-call duties – meaning you will build up a great amount of historical knowledge over time. Instead of keeping this knowledge in the mind of one team or one person, as SRE you are expected to document much of what you know. Constant upkeep of documentation and runbooks can ensure teams get the information they need right when they need it.

**Conducting Post-Incident Reviews**


Without thorough post-incident reviews, you have no way to identify what’s working and what’s not. As such you will be participating in post-incident reviews, documenting your findings and taking action on your learnings.


Maybe also add \""provision new servers\""... it is attractive to have a more technical approach to woo away developers and coordinators!

 **Location**  

  

Katowice, Gliwice, Amsterdam or Solna

**Jouw profiel**
----------------

 **Who are you?**  

  

As our Site Reliability Engineer you:

* Are an expert in your field, strong technical and analytical skills, can solve impossible problems.
* Have the ability to translate complicated technical matters into simple understandable language.
* Have experience in building and operating of server virtualization environments.
* Have thorough knowledge of operating systems (Linux/Windows 2019 and up).
* Work with Agile methodology.
* Have experience in troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
* Are able to deal with tight deadlines when they arise.
* Have automation experience with at least one configuration/deployment management system (Ansible, Jenkins pipelines, Azure DevOps…).
* Have experience with at least one of the following scripting languages (Powershell, Shell, Python…).
* Have experience working with GIT.
* Have experience developing CI/CD.

  

Next to this you bring:

* Experience in a large international environment is desirable.
* Experience with containers is a plus.

**Extra informatie**
--------------------

 **Our offer**  

Good remuneration, a challenging and international work environment, and the possibility to work with some of the best in the field. You will be working in interdisciplinary teams and you can always count on support from committed colleagues. We offer attractive employment conditions and opportunities for personal and professional development.

 ***We do it right:*** When you’re moving fast it can be tempting to constantly cut corners to things done. But this results in a product that is a struggle to work with and has unhappy users. We make that extra effort to be proud of what we’re building; understand the problem we’re solving, write one more test or tackle technical debt.

 ***We are empowered to act, challenge and lead:*** To work effectively as a team everyone must have a voice and feel they can stand up and be counted. As a software engineer at Returnista we want you to feel empowered. That could mean proposing new ideas, fixing things without seeking permission or challenging the CEO.

* At least three years of professional research experience in relevant fields.

* Potential to thrive in a teal culture based on self-managed teams, able to take initiative, self-reflect and collaborate with colleagues.
* Comfortable in a globally inclusive, multi-cultural, fast-paced, agile, and virtual/hybrid environment that promotes flexibility whilst being able to meet deadlines.

**What are you going to do**  

The Postdoc will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.  

The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and one Postdoc, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).

* Supervise RA’s and PhD’s working on the project;
* Draft pre-registrations and submit ethics reviews.
* Conduct data-analysis and prepare results for publications;
* Draft articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals;

Contribute to the Connected Minds Lab and the wider scientific community through collaborations, workshops, presentations/talks, attending conferences.

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=8b635dac2bd0c1f2,indeed,Data Analyst,Orbisk,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Orbisk,"Utrecht, UT, NL","parttime, fulltime",2024-07-31,,,,,True,,,,"**Our employees talk trash all day, every day.**

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**Assistance and Advisory Service (AAS)**



The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) is NATO's principal C3 capability deliverer and CIS service provider. It provides, maintains and defends the NATO enterprise-wide information technology infrastructure to enable Allies to consult together under Article IV, and, when required, stand together in the face of attack under Article V.



To provide these critical services, in the modern evolving dynamic environment the NCI Agency needs to build and maintain high performance-engaged workforce. The NCI Agency workforce strategically consists of three major categorise's: NATO International Civilians (NIC)'s, Military (Mil), and Interim Workforce Consultants (IWC)'s. The IWCs are a critical part of the overall NCI Agency workforce and make up approximately 15 percent of the total workforce.



**Role Background**

----------------


Are you a bachelor student within a technical study, such as Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, and are you looking for an apprentice internship? Do you enjoy programming? Are you skilled in MATLAB or Python? Would you like to apply your theoretical knowledge in a real world setting and gain some practical experience? Then this internship might be interesting to you!

**Background information**
--------------------------


The Metrology Leveling department is part of the Development and Engineering sector of ASML. Our primary focus is on measuring each silicon wafer prior to exposure inside the Twinscan, generating a surface map with nanometer precision. In addition, we also play a role in the calibration of the Twinscan itself and maintain the control of the ""measure sequence"", which includes both our measurements and those from other departments, such as Horizontal Alignment. Stage alignment (SA) is the functionality that is used to determine the position (and shape) of plates of the wafer stage with respect to the metro frame. These plates are used as a reference for other measurements - both on measure and on expose side. Which plate or plates are measured, on which plate reticle alignment is done and the type of measure sequence (Production, Robust, etc.) differs per platform.

**Your assignment**
-------------------


With the introduction of a new Stage Alignment sequence in software, we also need to update the diagnostics tool used to analyze and visualize data from the machine. One of the biggest diagnostics tools, FlatNG, needs to be updated to handle the analysis and visualization of data from this new sequence. This will allow customers to help troubleshoot their systems themselves or with the help of the local office. Therefore, this assignment consists of adding this new functionality to the diagnostics tool. Additionally, some other tasks may include fixing bugs in the tool or even attempting to link the measure sequence and stage alignment sequence tooling dashboards.

**Your profile**
----------------


To be a match for this internship, you:

* Are busy with your bachelor's in Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, or in a related technical study;
* Are skilled in MATLAB and/or Python;

**The Team**
  

  

Our Market Risk Management team consists of about 30 experts, determined to advise our business stakeholders to deliver on our purpose to achieve sustainable progress for all. Client behaviour is crucial to us and we use lots of data to explore, model and forecast it with state-of-the-art modelling methods and technologies.

* You will play a central role within ING and your activities will impact ING's overall P&L. Your success will depend on your ability to maintain good relations with our stakeholders, i.e. CRO NL divisions, Finance, the Business Tribes, Group Financial Risk, Model Validation, Group Treasury and also our external stakeholders ECB, DNB and the external auditor of ING.
* You take part - directly or indirectly - in the migration of ING NL to QRM for the monthly hedging process and the migration of our mortgages administration to STATER.

* An academic degree (MSc or PhD), preferably in Econometrics or other quantitative studies such as Mathematics, Engineering & Physics
* Finished additional professional qualifications in the financial risk field such as CFA, FRM, or the willingness to do so
* Minimum of 7 to 10 years of relevant experience in the financial sector (e.g. banking, insurance, consulting)

* Experience with SQL and coding (e.g. Python, R) is an advantage as well as experience with QRM, and/or other ALM systems

----------------


Are you a bachelor student within a technical study, such as Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, and are you looking for an apprentice internship? Do you enjoy programming? Are you skilled in MATLAB or Python? Would you like to apply your theoretical knowledge in a real world setting and gain some practical experience? Then this internship might be interesting to you!

**Background information**
--------------------------


The Metrology Leveling department is part of the Development and Engineering sector of ASML. Our primary focus is on measuring each silicon wafer prior to exposure inside the Twinscan, generating a surface map with nanometer precision. In addition, we also play a role in the calibration of the Twinscan itself and maintain the control of the ""measure sequence"", which includes both our measurements and those from other departments, such as Horizontal Alignment. Stage alignment (SA) is the functionality that is used to determine the position (and shape) of plates of the wafer stage with respect to the metro frame. These plates are used as a reference for other measurements - both on measure and on expose side. Which plate or plates are measured, on which plate reticle alignment is done and the type of measure sequence (Production, Robust, etc.) differs per platform.

**Your assignment**
-------------------


With the introduction of a new Stage Alignment sequence in software, we also need to update the diagnostics tool used to analyze and visualize data from the machine. One of the biggest diagnostics tools, FlatNG, needs to be updated to handle the analysis and visualization of data from this new sequence. This will allow customers to help troubleshoot their systems themselves or with the help of the local office. Therefore, this assignment consists of adding this new functionality to the diagnostics tool. Additionally, some other tasks may include fixing bugs in the tool or even attempting to link the measure sequence and stage alignment sequence tooling dashboards.

**Your profile**
----------------


To be a match for this internship, you:

* Are busy with your bachelor's in Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, or in a related technical study;
* Are skilled in MATLAB and/or Python;
* Are solution oriented and have a hands-on mentality;
* Have logical reasoning and a proactive mindset;
* Have good communication skills in English (verbal and written).


This is an apprentice internship for 4-5 days a week (3 days onsite) with a duration of 3 to 6 months. The start date is as soon as possible, October 2024.

**Please note that we can only consider students who are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship.**

**The program**

**Assistance and Advisory Service (AAS)**



The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) is NATO's principal C3 capability deliverer and CIS service provider. It provides, maintains and defends the NATO enterprise-wide information technology infrastructure to enable Allies to consult together under Article IV, and, when required, stand together in the face of attack under Article V.



To provide these critical services, in the modern evolving dynamic environment the NCI Agency needs to build and maintain high performance-engaged workforce. The NCI Agency workforce strategically consists of three major categorise's: NATO International Civilians (NIC)'s, Military (Mil), and Interim Workforce Consultants (IWC)'s. The IWCs are a critical part of the overall NCI Agency workforce and make up approximately 15 percent of the total workforce.



**Role Background**



The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) located in The Hague, Netherlands, is currently involved in the development and support of new and existing capabilities for NATO.



In light of these activities and in response to the NATO Overarching Space Policy as well as the declaration of Space as an Operational Domain, NATO has organised itself to keep pace with the evolving needs of the Alliance.



Within NCIA Chief Technology Office, the Space Technology Adoption and Resilience (STAR) team, will enable the exploitation of Space technology for NATO's defence and deterrence, ensuring NATO's technological edge for secure, resilient and effective employment of Space technologies for the Alliance.



STAR will develop and execute a technology strategy and associated roadmap for Space (CTO) and coordinate Space business delivery from within the NCIA Business Areas (COO). The STAR Team will provide technical expertise and strategic advice on Space for the benefit of the Alliance, design Space-based future services and foster their resilient integration into MultiDomain Operations (MDO). In line with strategic guidance and Space policy, the new STAR Team will provide the Alliance with technical expertise and strategic advice on Space, ensuring NCIA continues to provide applicable products, services and operational capability, taking resiliency from inception in line with the new NATO Strategic Concept.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.
