**Your Impact**
---------------


As the Product Adoption Senior Specialist, Change Management, you will join our People Services Enablement team as part of the global People function driving the transformation of our core People and Payroll processes through digital enablement.
You will work with our global People and Payroll communities as we transform the way we provide services to our firm members. The digitization of core People processes is one of the fundamental ways we are professionalizing our firm and creating an unrivaled environment for exceptional firm function talent.
The role will focus on the rollout and implementation of the ServiceNow People \& Payroll product, a part of the firm’s ServiceNow platform, to enable our People and Payroll process transformation. ServiceNow is the firm’s service management platform that provides transparency to work, increases efficiency, and streamlines global processes. We have undergone intense growth over the past 3 years with great success. We have made substantial impact by enabling self\-help and laying the foundation for generative AI (gen AI) and digital workflows which in turn has driven more increased demand for this product and projects continued growth.
For the next horizon of work, you will drive the overall adoption of ServiceNow People \& Payroll, lead change management, and support the People and Payroll functions to fully adopt this digital platform. This includes working directly with our global community of process leads to understand and anticipate impacts and implications of this technology on roles and responsibilities, processes, and workflows. You will shape, develop, and execute a strategy for changing colleague behavior and ensuring sustainable adoption of this platform across all user communities during and beyond initial implementation.
In this role, we will rely upon your passion for learning, passion for helping others, and aptitude to test, fail and try to come up with solutions that help our end users. This role has potential to grow – on the People side: to serve as a thought partner for our global HR, Payroll and People Operations teams to best utilize this digital solution and develop effective user support strategies; on the technical side, to get exposure to product development and system design and recommend enhancements to the product to encourage deeper user adoption.
For the first year in the role, the focus will split. One focus will be on implementations to expand to more groups such as HR and Payroll into Europe, Middle East, Africa, and others as prioritized by our People leaders. A second focus is working with our product team, user researchers and designers to influence product design and development to take into account product adoption. In parallel, you will help support an existing global group of global users that has on\-going training, documentation, and digital platform needs. Since ServiceNow People \& Payroll enables most processes in the People function, you will actively collaborate across a broad set of domains and teams.
**Your Growth**
---------------


As the Product Adoption Specialist, you will be a key member of the People Services Enablement team, which operates within the broader People Technology group and collaborates closely with the Tech Ecosystem. This team bridges the gap between process and technology, leveraging digital tools to drive people and payroll process transformation, achieve business outcomes, and innovate workflows. Covering the entire firm member lifecycle—from talent acquisition and onboarding to learning, professional development, and talent management—you may also partner with other People Technology product teams to ensure seamless integration and support.
In addition to this, you will work closely with the ServiceNow Center of Excellence and Innovation (CoEI), which unifies digital capabilities across the firm, and collaborate with Tech Ecosystem resources like user research and design to ground your change management plans in user insights and thoughtful design.
In this role, you will focus on driving adoption and engagement with the ServiceNow People \& Payroll platform across a globally distributed team in Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Poland, Spain, and the United States. You will design and execute change management plans for global implementations, develop and deliver tailored training programs, and create communication strategies with supporting materials to engage stakeholders. Acting as an expert and advocate for the system, you will provide ongoing coaching to champion user groups, offer guidance to individual users and teams, and address process gaps through digital solutions.
Lastly, you will monitor user metrics to inform strategies, stay updated on product enhancements, and lead efforts to adopt new features, ensuring the platform evolves to meet user needs effectively.

In this thesis, you will generate synthetic training data by transforming low\-poly 3D models of hands and feet into photorealistic images with labeled key points.

**Areas of Interest:** Generative AI, Controllable Image Generation, Few\-shot Learning


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


The examination of Parkinson’s symptoms is highly labor\-intensive, as it requires multiple trained neurologists to thoroughly analyze hand and leg movements. A group of hospitals aims to extend Parkinson’s treatment in the Netherlands to regions where such care is currently unavailable due to a shortage of trained neurologists. To achieve this, they want to make a pre\-selection through the help of AI on a smartphone. Part of the solution is a pose estimation model to track hand and foot movements. However, the current dataset for training the model is neither large nor diverse enough. The goal is to enrich the dataset with highly varied data while minimizing the need for manual effort.


Important features for detecting hands and feet could be better balanced by enriching the training dataset with synthetic data. To prevent manual labeling of the training data, it would be ideal if the ground truth for tracking key points is synthesized along with the training images. By converting low\-poly 3D models with key point rigs into photorealistic images, a synthetic dataset of labeled training images could be generated. Your task will be to investigate how to transform low\-poly models into photorealistic images using AI.

**The Assignment**
------------------


You will create a training dataset consisting of low\-poly 3D body rigs, focusing on the hands and feet. Next, you will explore transforming these low\-poly models into photorealistic images using a pix2pix GAN model. You may also fine\-tune the model to optimize hyperparameters for generating the best results. Your findings will be documented in a thesis and presented during your thesis defense.

**About us**

Although we take more photos now than ever, we seldom print them out. This neglects all the beautiful captured moments, as among these numerous photos lie precious memories worth printing. Be it the first pictures of your newborn, your niece or nephew, the amazing city trip with friends, or a fun night out.

With klikkie, we help you celebrate life and cherish memories. We aim to inspire you to make time for small moments and enjoy the present – what truly matters. Every month brings new moments, and it's a shame to forget them. Hence, the idea is to enable everyone to print high\-quality photos with minimal effort, month after month.

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

We’re crafting a metric that measures how achievable AI\-generated advice is—for real people. Think of it as teaching AI common sense; for instance, you can’t just age a decade instantly. Your challenge: integrate advanced language models like GPT to gauge if a “what if” scenario is useful or just a tech fantasy. Join us in shaping a more sensible, user\-centric AI future.**

**Areas of Interest:** XAI/Explainable AI, LLMs/Large Language Models, ChatGPT, NLP/Natural Language Processing


Counterfactual explanations are considered an intuitive and user\-friendly form of explainable AI. A counterfactual explanation proposes minimal changes to the input data that would lead to a different model output. As an example, a bank could make use of a model to determine if a customer can get a loan or not. If a customer was denied a loan, a counterfactual explanation could tell them that, for instance, “if their savings were increased by 10\.000€, they could get the loan”.


However, counterfactual explanations are not aware of the semantics of the input features. It might be that the minimal change for a customer to get a loan is to “increase their age from 25 to 35 years old” which, from a human perspective, is evidently unfeasible in a short time span.

**The Assignment**
------------------


In this project, we would like you to design a new evaluation metric to automatically determine the practicality of counterfactuals, that is, how attainable a counterfactual explanation is (or if it is even humanly attainable). Since the determination of practicality involves semantic understanding of the input features, our idea would be to leverage GPT and/or other large language model\-based technologies to accomplish this.


A user study could be conducted initially following the methodology proposed by Spreitzer et al (1\) to evaluate the practicality of different state\-of\-the\-art counterfactual techniques. The user study can then be extended to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed metric compared to the human evaluations.
