**What are you going to do**  

The Postdoc will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.  

The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and one Postdoc, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).  

  

**What are you going to do**

You will work on a wide array of research tasks, that include designing and performing empirical studies, and co-supervising PhDs and RA’s working on the project. There will be ample room for your own contributions and creativity, and writing grant applications together.  

Your tasks as a Postdoctoral researcher within this ERC Consolidator project will include the following:
* Supervise RA’s and PhD’s working on the project;
* Draft pre-registrations and submit ethics reviews.
* Conduct data-analysis and prepare results for publications;
* Draft articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals;

Contribute to the Connected Minds Lab and the wider scientific community through collaborations, workshops, presentations/talks, attending conferences.  
* 

**What do you have to offer**  

You are a conscientious and collaborative researcher who prefers to work in a team and has an affinity with computational modeling and programming.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

We are looking for a motivated postdoctoral researcher with an interest and expertise in building computational models of body representation, technological augmentation, and embodiment. The goal of the project is to uncover the neurocognitive principles underlying the embodiment of finger-extending exoskeletons. To what extent do internal representations of the body and technology (e.g. exoskeletal fingers) fuse into a single representation? To make headway on answering this fundamental question, we will use a variety of neuroscientific approaches (behaviour and M/EEG) and analytical tools (computational modelling, machine learning).
  
  

**You will be part of the NOW VIDI Grant ’Human 2.0:** A neurocognitive framework for upgrading the body’. As a postdoctoral researcher, you will design novel behavioural and neuroimaging paradigms (EEG) to measure internal representations of the body and tools (specifically, finger-extending exoskeletons), as well as their fusion. In this project, we endeavour to understand the fusion process at a neurocomputational level. You will apply Bayesian modelling to behavioural data to characterise the somatosensory and multisensory transformations underlying fusion. You will then use machine learning approaches to identify neural signatures of their implementation in EEG signals. The overall goal of these experiments is to gain a better understanding of the embodiment of technology at a computational and neural level. There will be close collaboration with other members of the team, including colleagues throughout the Donders Institute. Project management and mentoring (MSc and BSc) will also be part of your responsibilities.

***Passionate about the scientific analysis of Cultural Heritage? Join us in building the next generation X-ray instrument for art and archaeology!***


Job description


The most advanced X-ray based techniques are availble at synchrotron radiation sources, such as the ESRF in Grenoble or DESY in Hamburg. Access to these extremely bright sources is limited, and Dutch researchers are in a disadvantageous position as the Netherlands are not directly involved in any of these centres of research. The Smart\*Light project (https://interregvlaned.eu/en/smart-light-2-0/) aims to make advanced X-ray analysis techniques available in the Netherlands. Several institutes in The Netherlands (TU Delft, TU Eindhoven, DIFFER) and Flanders (UAntwerpen, UGent) collaborate to develop a compact instrument that comprises an intense and energy-tunable X-ray source, X-ray optics and detectors. The source is based on the Inverse Compton Effect, where visible laser light, scattered by a relativistic electron beam, is promoted into the X-ray range, yielding a brilliant, coherent X-ray beam with a narrow bandwidth.



Your main task will be to build and commission the experimental endstation of Smart\*light. This endstation is meant for a characterisation of the beam and proof of principle experiments with a focus on cultural heritage objects (art objects or archaeological objects). This involves testing different components in the laboratory with X-ray tubes, verify their integration into the control software, determine spectroscopic figures of merit, optimize the instrument and demonstrate its capabilities in the first experiments. Based on the early experiments you will be involved in the planning of future Smart\*Light upgrades, especially regarding optics and beam shaping.



This work will be done within the team of the Alfeld Lab at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering of the Delft University of Technology. The Department of Materials Science is a diverse institution, working in small laboratories, headed by independent PIs on a range of topics, including optimising steel microstructure, corrosion, recycling and the investigation of cultural heritage. The Alfeld Lab is working on the multi-modal investigation of cultural heritage, with a special focus on X-ray investigations and the development of new instruments and data evaluation approaches.



You will work with the PI of the group, M. Alfeld, on the Smart\*Light endstation in the lab in Delft and with the team of the TU/e on the installation of the endstation in Eindhoven. It is possible to supervise Master students during the project and to pursue independent research endavours related to spectroscopy and/or cultural heritage.


Requirements


* You have experience in the operation and configuration of X-ray instruments for spectrometry, diffraction, imaging or similar techniques.
* You need to have a PhD in science (preferrably physics or chemistry) or engineering (materials science).
* You can work independently in an interdisciplinary environment with multiple stakeholders.
* You have at least moderate programming skills in python or the readiness to acquire these during the project.
* You have a good command of the English language, as you will be working in an international environment, and preferably of Dutch.
* You do not need to have worked with cultural heritage before, but it is a definite bonus.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



From 1 September next, a salary increase of 3.7% applies due to a Collective Agreement amendment, followed by an additional 1% increase on 1 January 2025. In addition, most employees employed on 1 September 2024 will receive a one-off payment of €300 gross based on full-time employment.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for a:  

  

**Postdoc on Causal Machine Learning for Spatio-temporal Datasets**


The Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) is looking for an excellent Postdoc researcher (1.0 FTE) with a background in Computer Science (or a closely related field) to join a project focused on developing an advanced machine learning framework for spatio-temporal datasets. The position is for 4 years and is partially funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) through the Aspasia premium awarded to dr. Mitra Baratchi for her research on machine learning for spatio-temporal data. The successful applicant will be embedded in the Spatio-temporal data Analysis and Reasoning (STAR) and the Automated Design of Algorithms (ADA) research groups and collaborate with researchers at the Natural Computing (NACO) and the Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) Research Groups. Moreover, there are plenty of opportunities for interaction and collaboration with other groups at the institute and internationally.  

  

The research project is broadly focused on automated intervention design. An intervention is any external interference in an ongoing process that is performed to achieve a particular outcome. Being able to answer interventional questions automatically will help decision-makers solve complex challenges (i.e., reducing methane emissions or reducing the infection rate during a pandemic). Most machine learning algorithms designed for spatio-temporal data do not allow assessing the impact of interventions without capturing causal links. At the same time, configuring causal machine learning algorithms is extremely difficult, being an unsupervised learning task. In this project, we aim to design algorithmic solutions (e.g., new Automated Machine Learning approaches) for automatic and scalable assessment of interventions based on observational spatio-temporal datasets generated by modern sensing technologies (e.g., IoT sensors, mobile devices, Earth observations).

 **Key Responsibilities**


Within this position, it is expected that you will:

* conduct research within the scope of the project leading to peer-reviewed publications in journals and conference proceedings;
* collaborate closely with dr. Elena Raponi (the Natural Computing Group) and dr. Saber Salehkaleybar (the Explanatory Data Analysis Group) at LIACS;
* engage in teaching activities of the STAR Research Group and supervision of BSc and MSc students;

 **Selection Criteria**


We are looking for a candidate with expertise or experience with one or more of the following topics: machine learning for spatio-temporal data, causal machine learning (casual discovery and causal inference), and automated machine learning.

* holding (or close to acquiring) a PhD degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence or a closely related field;
* strong research vision and an academic mindset;
* strong publication record;
* being able to collaborate with scientific peers inside and outside your own research area;
* strong programming skills in Python or other programming languages;
* excellent proficiency and communication skills in English;

Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips.

Are you an IT enthusiast who wants to rise above yourself, in both your profession and as a person? At the TU/e, scientists and students continuously create the unthinkable. The strength of TU/e’s IT landscape is their key to success and, hence, so are you as being an essential contributor to that landscape. These creative minds expect you to offer them a solution for tomorrow that doesn’t exist today. Together we are building the high performance backbone that this epicenter of science and technology demands. Are you driven by taking ownership and do you have an entrepreneurial mindset? We like to get in touch with you!  

  

**About Library and Information Services (LIS)**  

The service department Library and Information Services (LIS) service is responsible for the entire demand - supply chain in the fields of information management, IT and library services. In consultation with stakeholders, requirements are collected, prioritized and aligned. The service department consists of six Product Areas: Library and Open Science, Research, Education, Corporate, Data & Insights and Platforms. Product Area Research is looking to strengthen their Research IT team with a consultant for the department Mathematics and computer science.  

  

**About the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science**  

With over 110 (assistant, associate and full) professors, almost 300 PhD and EngD students, about 1500 Bachelor students and 1000 Master students, the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) is the largest department of the TU/e. By performing top-level fundamental and applied research, and maintaining strong ties with industry, M&CS aims to contribute to science and innovation in and beyond the region.  

The department’s relationship with the high-tech industry in the Brainport region means that interested staff and students can contribute directly to the development of technological innovations with real-world relevance. Several successful spin-offs have originated from the department and our staff participates in many national and international research consortia.  

  

**The postion**  

As a research IT consultant, you work in collaboration with researchers to develop fit-for-purpose, sustainable IT solutions. In addition, you provide (proactive) advice on how to translate functional IT requirements to technical products, services and workflows. You work in proximity of the department and its IT landscape, and have a pioneering role in setting up innovative (specific) solutions. You are part of a multidisciplinary team in which you share and learn from each other’s knowledge and expertise. This enables you to facilitate researchers at TU/e in conducting their research. You work for a department which fosters multidisciplinary research requiring highly specialized computational methods. With your broad range of interests and ability to oversee the complex landscape of interests and challenges, you facilitate the needs of research, so that scientists can focus on their most innovative work. You will also have the opportunity to build up an extensive network and to specialize in relevant research areas.


How this looks like in practice? Read the following section:  

  

**A typical week of a Research IT consultant at M&CS:**  

On Monday, you start the week together with the departmental IT support unit (“The Hub”) and review the current developments and your activities at M&CS. Together, you align on priorities and determine tactics for the best approach. In the afternoon, you visit a researcher who wants to scale up their computational jobs, by parallelizing the script to compute efficiently on the available resources. You advise them on what resources could be suitable for this use case and optionally get them in contact with expert support on this topic. At the same time, you notice you receive this type of question quite often, so you coordinate with the back-office to make sure we can support this type of request long-term.


On Tuesday, you work out a plan to facilitate in the IT requirements for a new Computer Science lab at the department, in alignment with the TU/e policies and frameworks for deploying IT. As development of this lab


might be interesting for the whole department, you prepare an agenda item for the department's IT committee. As you work in the same room with your fellow consultants in the afternoon, you can easily count on their help on how to approach this.


On Wednesday, you work at home and focus on developing and testing an IDE platform for specific applications that are needed for the Machine Learning group. You maintain a close feedback loop with the users and make agreements on structural support of the prototype. You inform your colleagues as they might also be interested in such a platform for their customers.


On Thursday, you meet the board during your regular check-in moment to report on the progress of their ‘research IT’. You have prepared in advance by checking in with the users and their experience and by analyzing available user data. For instance, you know that their VM facility is running out of capacity, so you advise them in policy-making to distribute the resources more efficiently. In the afternoon, you have a strategic meeting with your fellow consultants on how you want to develop as a team and the services you're offering.


On Friday, you took a seminar in the morning to spike up your research data management knowledge, and this comes in handy as you received a request to consult on a data management workflow for a research group using Git and other storage platforms. You have a call with the Data Steward to work out the details and you contribute to the technical aspects of the workflow.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* You have a minimum education of a Master’s degree or PhD degree, preferably with a background in Computer Science, Data Science or any related field;
* Several years of experience with conducting research, and you are able to effectively communicate with scientific staff;
* You are organizationally sensitive; you initiate and maintain relevant relationships with customers, (key) user groups, and suppliers;
* You identify the wishes and needs of our researchers, to proactively provide fit-for-purpose, IT solutions, and at the same time make proposals for sustainable innovation implementation based on demand trends;
* You are a pleasant collaboration partner for both scientists and the IT back office, thereby mediating between organization and innovation;
* You initiate action to innovate existing products and services, based on the interest of the department you represent;
* You have experience with one or more of the following techniques: Remote computing (cloud and / or on premise), Research Data Management and processing, Software Engineering, Git and / or code repository management, Software Licensing, AI related topics, Internet of Things, Infrastructural Architecture;
* Experience with scripting and automating workflows, in particular in Linux OS, is a bonus.


If you are concerned that you don’t meet all the requirements sufficiently, but the job does excite you, then be sure to respond, we would love to look at your profile.

How does the medieval body of texts known as 'canon law' reflect social and moral ideas? With a combination of AI and an advanced dataset, can we reveal patterns in the transmission and alteration of these ideas over time? Join the SOLEMNE project as a research assistant to explore these questions and more.
  
  

The medieval body of texts known as 'canon law' not only regulates strictly religious or ecclesiastical issues but also communicates social and moral ideas about the inner life of society. With an advanced dataset and novel AI techniques, it is possible to chart how such ideas are transmitted, appropriated, altered, and promoted in canonical collections. As a research assistant you will contribute to this study by expanding its data entry and training AI models.
  
  

This one-year position is part of the project 'The Social Life of Early Medieval Normative Texts' (SOLEMNE), funded through an ERC Consolidator Grant awarded to Dr Sven Meeder. A fuller description of the project can be found here. The SOLEMNE project aims to describe and contextualise the spread of social norms as articulated through specific combinations of canons in a bottom-up approach starting from the vast corpus of manuscript witnesses of canonical collections in every shape and form (4th-12th centuries). A dynamic dataset forms an essential element of the project, combined with an innovative digital tool that allows for queries of shared content in canonical collections or manuscripts and of levels of affinity based on combinations of authoritative statements.
  
  

In close collaboration with the project's postdoctoral researcher, associated data scientists, and development team, you will (i) contribute to the design of the database to store the information regarding original medieval manuscripts preserving individual canons and entire canonical collections, and scholarly editions of these texts, (ii) play a key role in training handwritten text recognition (HTR) models using eScriptorium software as well as AI-driven models for correction and normalisation of the transcription, (iii) populate the database with the data gathered from the original documents and printed reference works, (iv) contribute to the wider communication of the project's results, including materials intended for a general audience, and (v) cooperate closely with all of SOLEMNE’s subprojects.

**The challenge**


Eindhoven University of Technology's Industrial Design department developed and implemented Data Foundry, a platform to address these challenges. Data Foundry enables the collection and management of data from remote devices in real-time and supports qualitative data collection, participant management, and data visualization. Data Foundry is also increasingly used to prototype in design using data, server-side scripting and AI. Despite successfully supporting over 2000 design projects, Data Foundry is currently limited to Eindhoven University of Technology due privacy and data sharing protocols. We want to change that and use Data Foundry in collaborative contexts and make Data Foundry available to others design institutions.


This is why we will **open-source Data Foundry** and we need your help for that. The project 'ODeDaI' aims to enhance Data Foundry's configurability and extend its documentation, allowing seamless integration with other universities and institutions. This will enable broader adoption of the platform, ensuring compliance with diverse data sharing policies and promoting open science practices within the design community and beyond. By making Data Foundry adaptable for various institutions and policies, we intend to foster greater collaboration amongst researchers, educational institutions, and industry professionals, both nationally and internationally.

* You will be surrounded by a team of fellow EngDs and PhDs that focus on data-enabled design and more generally new tools and infrastructures for Industrial Design.


**The EngD position**


As a designer and creative technologist you dive deep into understanding the needs and workflows of data x design, both in education and research practice. You work with the Data Foundry infrastructure and prepare it inside-out for an open-source release in 2025. You work as part of the Data Foundry team and realize ideas for new features, documentation and helpful education materials. You build and work with growing community to collect user feedback, early and often.


Requirements


* A Masters degree in an industrial design or creative software development related discipline (e.g., Industrial Design with technical focus, Computer Science or Software Engineering with design affinity). Masters degree needs to be obtained before the prospective starting date of this position: September/ October 2024.


Design creation skills


* Proficient with full-stack integration of different software libraries and adapting them to your needs to build great user experiences (e.g., output of AI algorithms, managing local development environments)
* Knowledge of software designing and architecture, different architectural patterns, data modelling.
* Interest in and understanding of AI, data visualization
* Eye for detail and quality
* Experience with writing technical documentation is a plus.


Soft skills


* Strong collaborator with multi-disciplinary team members and academic design education stakeholders

-------------------


The Department of Industrial Design of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), in cooperation with Philips Clinical Informatics is offering two fully funded 2-year positions to master graduates leading to the award of an EngD (Engineering Doctorate) degree in Designing Human-System Interaction.


**Societal urgency**


Access to high quality healthcare is under increasing pressure. Patient volumes are rising due to an aging population, and the amount of data from scans and image interpretation is increasing at a steeper pace than radiologists and pathologists can handle. Radiology leaders have raised alarm that labor shortages are leading to longer wait times and delays in treatment for patients. Never has there been a bigger need to relieve the pressure from staff. But how exactly do we make that happen?


**The challenge**


Adoption of radiology and pathology solutions is increasingly driven by the extent to which solutions “naturally” fit into clinical workflows and enable radiologists and pathologists to deliver quality at speed. This requires not only high-quality medical data and cutting-edge AI models. More so, clinical acceptance and adoption depends on solutions that are designed with a clear understanding of clinical workflows and usage patterns, and with the requirements that different clinical experts have on their tooling. Beyond functional requirements, successful clinical adoption needs highly intuitive solutions, seamless workflow integration (speed), and a great user experience. In sum, we face the overarching challenge of how to integrate AI-based clinical decision-making tools into clinical practice that is characterized by fast-paced, high-stakes decision-making informed by deep domain knowledge and year-long expertise.


Prototypes that are highly realistic in the eyes of the clinical user have shown to be an important “vehicle” to enable rapid co-creation with clinicians. It enables them to give meaningful clinician-centered direction to development complex technical tools. Are you ready to iteratively create such prototypes and shape them together with experts in the field?


**You are part of a learning community**


You will be strongly embedded in and work closely with a highly dynamic community with experts from different disciplines including designers, researchers, engineers, clinical specialists and business:


* You will work “in-tandem” with your fellow EngD team member. You learn from each other by bouncing-off ideas and taking turns at different steps in the design process.
* You will immerse yourself in the Philips Clinical Informatics business context working closely with the design teams on the latest technology developments in radiology and digital pathology, in close collaboration with hospitals and clinical end-users where the impact is made.
* The EngD program offers a personalized learning experience through a mix of courses, coaching and hands-on learning by doing.
* You will be surrounded by a team of fellow EngDs and PhDs that focus on human-AI collaboration in the healthcare domain.


**The two positions**


**EngD position 1 – The medical data visualization & AI designer**


In this position you dive deep into understanding the needs and workflows of the clinical end users and translate those insights into design concepts and interactive data visualizations. You express your ideas by creating clickable demonstrators together with your buddy “the creative technologist” (the second EngD candidate) and you enjoy using your user research skills to set up interviews and simulated use tests to collect user feedback, early and often.


Requirements


* A Masters degree in an industrial design related discipline (e.g., Industrial Design, Interaction Design, UX-UI, HCI). Masters degree needs to be obtained before the prospective starting date of this position: September/ October 2024.


Design creation skills


* Strong conceptual design skills (translating user insights into concepts pushing the boundaries of the status quo)
* Affinity with UI, visual design skills, wireframes and clickable prototypes (e.g., Figma)
* Data visualization (next gen medical data & AI visualization)
* Interest in and understanding of AI (i.e., integration of AI in user journeys)
* Eye for detail and quality


Design research skills


* Enjoy experimentation with iterations based on user feedback and contextual insights
* Intermediate knowledge of user research methods (e.g., interviews, setting up and running small hands-on user tests with clinical end users, inquiries with stakeholders)


Soft skills


* Strong collaborator with multi-disciplinary team members and industry stakeholders
* Curious to know more about the healthcare domain and in obtaining a deep understanding of clinical end users in their daily work
* Can-do attitude and hands-on designer


**EngD position 2 – The creative technologist**


In this position you use your front-end software prototyping powers to create dynamic and realistic clinical workflow prototypes with clinical data, medical data visualizations and interactive AI outputs. You work closely with your buddy, the “medical data visualization & AI designer” where you take the lead in interactive prototype implementation to create a realistic clinical user experience based on actual data and AI outputs.


Requirements


* A Masters degree in an industrial design or creative software development related discipline (e.g., Industrial Design with technical focus, Computer Science or Software Engineering with design affinity). Masters degree needs to be obtained before the prospective starting date of this position: September/ October 2024.


Technical skills


* Solid front-end software prototyping development skills with modern web technologies and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, data visualization tools and libraries)
* Proficient with full-stack integration of different software libraries and adapting them to your needs to build great user experiences (e.g., output of AI algorithms, managing local development environments)
