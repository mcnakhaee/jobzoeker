**The Opportunity: Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst**


We are looking for an experienced Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst to take a lead role in transforming data into actionable insights that drive strategic decision\-making across the company. In this hands\-on role, you will design and deliver business\-critical dashboards and analytical reports that inform how we improve patient access and grow our business. As a senior individual contributor on our Data \& Analytics team, you’ll work alongside a Data Engineer and fellow Analysts within our Product \& Engineering organization. You will collaborate cross\-functionally with stakeholders in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial, and Product, becoming a go\-to expert for data insights.


**What You'll be Doing:**


In your first 3–6 months, you will hit the ground running by spearheading the creation of several high\-impact dashboards, including:

* Client Program Performance Dashboards – to monitor and visualize our patient programs' performance and identify opportunities to improve outcomes.
* Revenue Tracking Dashboards – to provide real\-time visibility into revenue streams and financial KPIs, helping steer commercial strategy.
* Patient Source Attribution Dashboards – to trace and illustrate how patients find our platform (using tools like Sankey diagrams for flow visualization), informing marketing and outreach efforts.

**This is the right opportunity for you if:**

* Design, build, and maintain interactive dashboards and reports in Tableau (and other BI tools) to track key metrics across the business. You will own end\-to\-end dashboard development – from gathering requirements to data modeling and visualization – ensuring stakeholders have self\-service access to up\-to\-date insights.
* Deliver actionable insights for growth: Analyze operational and marketing data (from MySQL/PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases, Airflow, Excel, etc.) to understand key performance drivers. Translate data into clear findings and recommendations that drive user acquisition, patient engagement, and sustainable business growth.
* Be the analytical partner for leadership: Serve as a point of contact for the leadership team on all things data. Provide in\-depth reporting, ad\-hoc analysis, and executive\-friendly dashboards that inform strategic decisions and highlight trends in business performance.
* Focus on data quality and accuracy: Work closely with our Data Engineer and product engineers to ensure we have reliable, well\-structured data. Help maintain and validate data models, databases and data pipelines so that reports are accurate and reflect the single source of truth. Identify any data gaps or integrity issues and collaborate on solutions.
* Drive performance improvements: Monitor key KPIs (such as program success metrics, funnel conversion rates, revenue metrics) and proactively identify operational bottlenecks or areas for improvement. Provide insight\-driven suggestions to optimize workflows, improve patient recruitment, or streamline processes.
* Cross\-functional collaboration: Partner with teams in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial and Product to understand their analytics needs. Support these stakeholders by building custom reports or exploratory analysis, and ensure they can leverage your dashboards for day\-to\-day decision making. For example, you might deep\-dive into marketing funnel data to advise the Growth team, or analyze operational turnaround times to assist the Operations team.
* Advanced analysis and data exploration: Use Python (with pandas, numpy, etc.) and SQL for deeper ad\-hoc analyses, data discovery, and data preparation. When questions go beyond existing reports, you’ll dig into raw data to uncover insights, validate hypotheses, and prepare datasets for further analysis.
* Mentorship and best practices: As a senior analyst, mentor and guide junior analysts on the team. Review their work, share knowledge of best practices in analytics, SQL querying, and visualization. Lead by example in documentation and reproducibility. You will also enable business users’ self\-service by training stakeholders on how to use established dashboards and reporting tools effectively.
* Shape data strategy: Contribute to our overall data strategy by identifying new metrics or analytics opportunities that can drive value. Advocate for a data\-driven mindset across the organization. You’ll play a key role in evolving our analytics capabilities (for instance, suggesting new BI features or improving reporting processes) to support a scaling, high\-growth environment.

**You Have:**

* Experience: 5\+ years in data analytics, business intelligence, or a similar role, with a track record of handling complex data projects and delivering insights to business stakeholders. Experience in a growth\-stage tech company or digital health environment is a plus.
* Strong proficiency in SQL (ability to write complex queries in MySQL/PostgreSQL). Hands\-on experience with data visualization tools, especially Tableau (or similar BI platforms), to create dynamic dashboards. Familiarity with NoSQL databases and tools like Airflow is beneficial. Advanced Excel skills for quick analysis and data prep.
* Experience using Python for data analysis tasks – e.g. data cleaning, exploration, and validation using libraries such as pandas or numpy. Must be comfortable scripting to manipulate data when needed.
* Present data in a clear and compelling way. Experience creating a variety of chart types and visuals – from standard bar/line charts to more advanced visuals like Sankey diagrams or funnel charts – to illustrate user flows and attribution. An eye for design and attention to detail in dashboards ensuring they are accurate, easy to interpret, and visually engaging.
* Analytical Mindset: Excellent analytical and problem\-solving skills. Capable of interpreting complex datasets, identifying trends and outliers, and connecting the dots between data and business outcomes. You approach problems with curiosity and a hypothesis\-driven mindset.
* Business Acumen: Strong understanding of business metrics and growth drivers. Ability to translate business questions from non\-technical stakeholders into analytical approaches, and then translate back findings into business terms. Experience working on metrics like revenue, conversion funnels, customer acquisition cost, etc., is highly valued.
* Exceptional communication skills in English (our company language). You can distill complex analyses into clear insights and narratives for different audiences. Comfortable presenting findings to senior leadership and guiding discussions on data.
* Collaboration: Proven ability to work cross\-functionally and build positive relationships with diverse teams — from operations managers to product designers. You’re a team player who can align data projects with the needs of multiple departments and manage stakeholder expectations.
* Leadership \& Mentorship: Demonstrated experience mentoring junior analysts or leading analytical projects. You enjoy helping others grow their skills and can influence without formal authority. You’re enthusiastic about sharing knowledge and establishing best practices for analytics within a team.
* Self\-Driven \& Organized: Thrives in a fast\-paced, high\-growth environment. Able to manage and prioritize multiple projects and requests, deliver on deadlines, and adapt to evolving business needs. You take ownership of your work and proactively seek out ways to add value.
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in a relevant field (e.g. Data Science, Statistics, Business, Computer Science, or similar) is preferred, or equivalent practical experience in data analysis roles.

**What we offer**

* Impactful work that helps patients gain access to potentially lifesaving treatments.

In this thesis, you will generate synthetic training data by transforming low\-poly 3D models of hands and feet into photorealistic images with labeled key points. Using techniques like pix2pix GANs, you’ll explore and optimize the process to create a diverse and enriched dataset, enhancing pose estimation models for AI\-driven Parkinson’s symptom analysis.**

**Areas of Interest:** Generative AI, Controllable Image Generation, Few\-shot Learning


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


The examination of Parkinson’s symptoms is highly labor\-intensive, as it requires multiple trained neurologists to thoroughly analyze hand and leg movements. A group of hospitals aims to extend Parkinson’s treatment in the Netherlands to regions where such care is currently unavailable due to a shortage of trained neurologists. To achieve this, they want to make a pre\-selection through the help of AI on a smartphone. Part of the solution is a pose estimation model to track hand and foot movements. However, the current dataset for training the model is neither large nor diverse enough. The goal is to enrich the dataset with highly varied data while minimizing the need for manual effort.


Important features for detecting hands and feet could be better balanced by enriching the training dataset with synthetic data. To prevent manual labeling of the training data, it would be ideal if the ground truth for tracking key points is synthesized along with the training images. By converting low\-poly 3D models with key point rigs into photorealistic images, a synthetic dataset of labeled training images could be generated. Your task will be to investigate how to transform low\-poly models into photorealistic images using AI.

**The Assignment**
------------------


You will create a training dataset consisting of low\-poly 3D body rigs, focusing on the hands and feet. Next, you will explore transforming these low\-poly models into photorealistic images using a pix2pix GAN model. You may also fine\-tune the model to optimize hyperparameters for generating the best results. Your findings will be documented in a thesis and presented during your thesis defense.

However, these systems present challenges, particularly with model agnostic explanations which are more approximations. This includes global and local explanations, with local ones possibly misleading due to their narrow focus. Effective testing is crucial to verify if explanations are sensible to experts, consistent across different outcomes, and to understand when they might change.**

**Areas of Interest:** Artificial Intelligence, Explainable AI


Explainable machine learning and artificial intelligence models have been used to justify a model’s decision\-making process. This added transparency aims to help improve user performance and understanding of the underlying model. However, in practice, explainable systems face many open questions and challenges.


Model agnostic explanations are more approximations. In general there are two kinds of explanations: global and local explanations. For the latter, there’s the possibility that the explanation is off, because it only looks at the local inference. It’s possible that for opposite inference, we get exactly the same explanations. To get proper explanations we’ll need to be able to test them. Are the explanations sensible to business experts and aren’t there any same explanations for opposite outcomes? And do we know when explanations will change?

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

We’re crafting a metric that measures how achievable AI\-generated advice is—for real people. Think of it as teaching AI common sense; for instance, you can’t just age a decade instantly. Your challenge: integrate advanced language models like GPT to gauge if a “what if” scenario is useful or just a tech fantasy. Join us in shaping a more sensible, user\-centric AI future.**

**Areas of Interest:** XAI/Explainable AI, LLMs/Large Language Models, ChatGPT, NLP/Natural Language Processing


Counterfactual explanations are considered an intuitive and user\-friendly form of explainable AI. A counterfactual explanation proposes minimal changes to the input data that would lead to a different model output. As an example, a bank could make use of a model to determine if a customer can get a loan or not. If a customer was denied a loan, a counterfactual explanation could tell them that, for instance, “if their savings were increased by 10\.000€, they could get the loan”.


However, counterfactual explanations are not aware of the semantics of the input features. It might be that the minimal change for a customer to get a loan is to “increase their age from 25 to 35 years old” which, from a human perspective, is evidently unfeasible in a short time span.

**The Assignment**
------------------


In this project, we would like you to design a new evaluation metric to automatically determine the practicality of counterfactuals, that is, how attainable a counterfactual explanation is (or if it is even humanly attainable). Since the determination of practicality involves semantic understanding of the input features, our idea would be to leverage GPT and/or other large language model\-based technologies to accomplish this.


A user study could be conducted initially following the methodology proposed by Spreitzer et al (1\) to evaluate the practicality of different state\-of\-the\-art counterfactual techniques. The user study can then be extended to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed metric compared to the human evaluations.

 What we offer
   

  

**About Us**
 We are Xomnia, the AI consulting company. We’re curious problem solvers who believe data will change the way we live, work and communicate. Being at the forefront of this revolutionary change in a sustainable, positive way is what drives us.
   

  

 We solve challenging data science and engineering projects, from start to finish. From developing an application for real\-time fraud detection on Google Cloud Platform, to setting up a customized recommender engine in an existing Microsoft Azure environment \- we develop and deploy tailor\-made data science solutions.
   

  

 Xomnia started in 2013 in one room in the heart of Amsterdam. These days we take up nearly two houses. But more than just a workspace, we're a community that values authenticity. Here, everyone is encouraged to be themselves, to learn, and to have fun in the process.
   

  

 Representing over 20 nationalities, our team values the unique cultural perspective that each individual brings to the table. Moreover, with the Dutch tech sector seeing a female representation around 11%, we are proud that over 30% of our workforce is female. Nevertheless, we recognize that there is more to be done, and we continue working to overcome barriers that still exist.
   

  

 We encourage all candidates to apply, and we don’t discriminate based on race, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age. However, a reality that we face is that many of our clients prefer to communicate in Dutch, making Dutch proficiency essential for some roles. Additionally, while we wish that we could sponsor visas for everyone, there are instances when it is not feasible.
   

  

 If you're experienced, passionate, and align with our values, we want to hear from you.",Information Technology & Services,https://nl.linkedin.com/company/xomnia,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEMxcvPDbBSiQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1724141336408/xomnia_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=0v5TZXJBHiKRXgKL2iodt4MaQoB-A_OFbbEE8e8kKF0,,,,,,,,,,,,ai engineer,linkedin,en

Our clients offer top\-tier pay for top\-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?
   

  

 Master AI\-Driven Development or Step Aside. For Engineers Who Ship, Not Talk.
   

  

 Most development teams still operate in the dark ages—manual code reviews, reactive debugging, and AI as an afterthought. At Trilogy, we've rewritten the rules. Our entire engineering ecosystem breathes AI—from ideation to deployment, bug detection to optimization. This isn't about occasionally using AI tools; it's about fundamentally transforming how software gets built.
   

  

 We're seeking elite developers who refuse to accept the status quo of traditional software engineering. You'll deconstruct established B2B products and rebuild them as cloud\-native powerhouses with AI intelligence embedded at every level. You'll deploy features that leverage cutting\-edge retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG), automate defect detection, and deliver flawlessly—zero downtime, zero compromises.
   

  

 If you're ready to operate at the bleeding edge where AI meets software engineering, this position will accelerate your career trajectory. If you prefer architecture debates over shipping code or manual processes over automation, look elsewhere.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Harness advanced RAG vector stores and AI analysis tools to systematically identify, diagnose, and eliminate product defects with unprecedented efficiency
* Architect and implement AI development agents that transform how features are designed, developed, and deployed across cloud\-native applications
* Drive enterprise\-grade solutions through strategic collaboration with a distributed global engineering team


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Managing infrastructure overhead: Our streamlined processes eliminate traditional DevOps burdens so you can focus exclusively on high\-impact development
* Sitting through productivity\-killing meetings: We prioritize your technical output over discussion—expect focused collaboration, not endless conversation
* Writing code the conventional way: If your workflow still begins with manual coding rather than AI\-assisted generation, this position isn't aligned with our approach


**Full Stack Developer Key Responsibilities**
 Accelerate business transformation by implementing AI\-driven features that revolutionize service provider workflows and deliver measurable competitive advantage in the market.
   

  

**Basic Requirements**
* Demonstrated AI\-First Development Mindset: You must approach problems by leveraging AI capabilities first, then enhancing with human expertise—not the reverse
* 4\+ years of production software development experience with server\-side web applications
* Proven track record building mission\-critical B2B software applications that meet enterprise reliability standards
* Deep expertise in cloud\-native development and serverless architectures, specifically within AWS environments
* Advanced proficiency with GenAI code assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor.sh, v0\.dev) in professional development contexts
* Verifiable success implementing Generative AI solutions with quantifiable business impact


**About Trilogy**
 Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer\-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon\-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud\-based stack.

 You’ll join 15 analysts in Bol’s advertising analytics organization. Together you share a mission of making people performant through analytics. This role is for the versatile analyst, one that is equally comfortable talking to data as to stakeholders. Your stakeholders can be colleagues from the Advertising and Product domains as well as advertiser customers. Your days vary but at the core you’ll use SQL/Python/Tableau/dbt/git to provide metrics, analysis, and predictions that help advertisers make better decisions.
   

  

 You’ll collaborate with stakeholders to understand business needs, identify key performance metrics, define high value use cases for analytics to help advertising customers make better decisions. Your work will be input for amongst others client meetings, white papers, webinars, and public industry appearances.
   

  

* Analysing advertising KPIs in all stages of the Media Funnel and identifying relevant shopper behaviour across their journeys. You'll use your analytical skills to uncover patterns and insights in our data that help us understand how to optimize the effectiveness of our advertising propositions.
* Working closely with internal stakeholders (Sales, Customer Success, and Marketing) and top advertising and agency customers to identify high value applications of analytics. You use your data expertise to help guide decision\-making processes and ensure that data\-driven insights and recommendations are central to retail media plans.
* Developing extensive domain knowledge across our business to effectively manage and analyse advertising KPIs delivered through presentations, dashboards, white papers or public industry appearances.
* Developing high\-quality data pipelines for dashboarding and KPIs in collaboration with our analytical engineers (using dbt), ensuring that the data we use for reporting and analysis is accurate, complete, and up\-to\-date.
* Writing high\-quality and easily interpretable SQL and Python code that can be reused. You'll use your SQL skills to query large, complex datasets, extracting the data needed to answer key business questions. You'll also ensure that your SQL and Python code is reusable, well\-documented, and easily interpretable by other members of the team.


**Why you can make the difference?**
 You’re an enthusiastic team player who lives and breathes analytics. The ideal candidate for this role has a strong analytical mindset, a healthy appetite for making business impact and excellent communication and collaboration skills. You have experience working with SQL and dashboarding tools like Tableau and are comfortable navigating and analysing large, complex datasets. You also have a knack for translating complex data insights into clear, actionable recommendations.
   

  

**3 reasons why this is (not) for you** 
**Switch to find out**
* \- If you strongly value clarity No, if innovating, autonomy, and ambiguity sound terrifying to you.
* \- You only want to process data No, if you only want to process data and prefer someone else to handle project and stakeholder management.
* \- If you believe analysts don’t need domain knowledge No, if you don't want to dive into the world of advertising. Curiosity and willingness to learn about our domain and customers are key to your success.
* \+ You’re an analytics professional Yes, if you have 5\+ year experience delighting decision makers with your analytical skills. SQL is a must, Python scripting is a strong plus.
* \+ Obsess over creating value for advertisers Yes, if you believe output does not equal outcome and judge success by value creation.
* \+ You get (and create) energy by working with others Yes, if you can translate technical information into language anyone can understand. You enjoy working with both data and people.

Smart lighting goes far beyond simply switching lights on and off. We use our wireless mesh networks to control lighting and serve as a backbone for smarter buildings. This enables use cases such as tracking medical equipment, people counting, climate monitoring, and more.
 



  





 Our solution excels in the strength of our wireless mesh network, which is far more scalable and robust than any of our competitors. This enables us to cover cases and buildings that no one else can, such as explosion\-proof environments (refineries, mines), container ships, and similar challenging locations. We achieve this in collaboration with our wireless partner Wirepas, which provides industry\-leading IoT technology.
 



 The future of our solution is bright. Industry giants like ABB, Siemens, and Schneider Electric have announced plans to develop a new standard for wireless smart buildings using the same Wirepas technology that we use. This puts us in a leading global position to provide lighting control within this new standard. See:
 



  





 Our solution is deployed worldwide through partners such as Trilux, Royal BAM, Equans, and Schneider Electric, operating in countries including the U.S., Australia, South Korea, Brazil, France, the UK, and many more. Despite our global reach and collaboration with multi\-billion\-dollar clients, we remain a small, agile team (currently 15 people). We maintain short lines of communication and a fast\-paced, startup mentality. Expect to work closely with customers, see your code deployed on large\-scale sites rapidly, and make meaningful contributions to advancing our product. This is not the place for someone looking to hide in a corner and simply tick off Jira tickets!
 



  





**Your Role \& Responsibilities** 




 Ingy provides its products for truly large scale installations in warehouses, logistics centers, large office buildings: up to thousands of devices with multiple gateways each connected to the cloud. Ingy is evolving into a scale\-up, prioritizing the automation of provisioning new sites, supporting and diagnosing existing ones, and onboarding new partners. This transition requires a robust cloud infrastructure, where you will play a key role as a main contributor.
 



  





**Examples of Projects You'll Be Working On** 



* Use infrastructure\-as\-code (Terraform) to \- with one click of a button \- deploy our entire infrastructure on thousands of gateways supporting millions of devices.
* Completely revamp our firmware delivery to enable one\-click deployment of new software to hundreds of devices across dozens of manufacturers.
* Create a highly flexible, container\-based infrastructure where Docker containers can be seamlessly moved between gateways and the cloud for an optimal support experience.
* Creating the data infrastructure to store, analyse and display data collected by hundreds of thousands of sensors, sending data every few minutes.
* Add LLM based functionality to analyse and interact with the data stored.



  





**About the Team** 




 Ingy is a fast\-paced startup transitioning into a scale\-up. We have built a highly skilled, ambitious team with expertise across front\-end, cloud, gateways, and firmware. While everyone has at least one specialization, we value flexibility and encourage team members to expand their skills into at least one or two additional areas.
 



 We foster a culture of continuous learning and support personal growth. There are no rigid career steps—you can grow as quickly and in whatever direction suits you best, whether it's deep algorithmic coding, architecture, customer interaction, project management, Scrum mastery, or product management.
 



 Collaboration is key. All code is peer\-reviewed, and we see this as an opportunity to become better engineers every day. You are expected to actively contribute to the growth of your colleagues whenever possible.
 



 We also embrace innovation and strongly encourage you to explore and apply the latest LLM tools to enhance productivity and code quality.
 



 Our team is heavily technology\-focused—expect lunchtime discussions on everything from Minecraft to the validity of the Chinese Room Argument. And yes,
 *42* 
 is always a good answer.
 



  





**Your Skills \& Qualifications** 




 We are hiring for a junior position (0\-3 years of experience). While we welcome candidates with a broad skill set and diverse interests, you must have cloud development experience. This could come from your education, graduation project, or personal work, but you must have used Terraform or an alternative infrastructure\-as\-code approach.
 



  





**Must\-Have Skills** 



* Strong understanding of cloud computing, including:
* Building cloud infrastructure using infrastructure\-as\-code (Terraform)
* Good understanding of security principles (ideally tailored to AWS services and in general, no use of long\-term credentials, secure in transit and at rest, traceability, etc.)
* Containerization, dockers, orchestration
* Familiarity with cloud infrastructure, especially AWS (Cognito, Timestream, IoTcore, IoT greengrass)
* Knowledge of GitHub/Bitbucket pipelines, REST interfaces, the MQTT protocol, Linux systems, DNS records
* Understanding of trade\-offs between creating scalable services (in the cloud) and keeping things local from perspectives of availability, pricing, latency, etc.



  





**Bonus Skills (Highly Valued!)** 



* Experience with Python, Javascript, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Pulumi, Raspberry PIs
* Personal IoT projects or an active GitHub portfolio

Yes, we’re looking for a Full\-stack web developer. And yes, there are plenty of other opportunities out there. If you’re exploring your options, you might be thinking about growth, creativity, a sense of purpose, or just a healthier work\-life balance. We get it—everyone wants their own version of a “perfect fit.”
 



  




 So here’s why you might consider AIAIAI:
 
  





 We’re an early\-stage startup with significant traction, on track to become cashflow positive this year—so there’s no frantic chasing of funding to stay afloat. Our team is small (currently 8 of us) by design, and we plan to grow to around 15 by the end of the year to ensure profitability. From there, we’ll scale linearly—about 3–5 new hires a month—depending on our sales results.
 



  





 You’ll be working with an experienced development team that’s already built and scaled successful SAAS products. AIAIAI itself was born out of two sister companies, Lifely and Nucleoo, giving you access to a broader network of colleagues and experts in Amsterdam, Granada, and Madrid. We hope you look back in 20 years and say, “That’s where I did some of the most impactful and fulfilling work of my life.”
 



  





 AI—yes, it’s a buzzword filled with smoke and mirrors. That’s not us (or at least, we’re trying not to be). Because no matter how slowly actual adoption might be happening, we’re all being affected by AI in one way or another—teachers feeling the pressure to adapt, office employees expected to deliver more in less time. There’s a huge segment of people, especially once you drive a bit outside big cities, who aren’t “prompting” or tapping into AI to boost productivity. Their jobs—and the relevance of their employers—is at risk. That’s what we address at
 



  





 AIAIAI: helping everyday people use AI in a way that feels natural to them. We meet them where they are, instead of asking them to change. We’ve designed our product so that both employees and companies don’t end up saying “AI AI AI” three years from now because they were blindsided. It’s a product being used daily by users who’d typically fall into the late majority or even “laggards” on the adoption curve. And that’s the mission you’d help drive: making a fast\-changing world a bit more manageable for people who just need it to work.
   




 What can you expect from the role?
 
 As our Full\-stack web developer, you’ll help shape the core architecture of our platform—both front\-end and back\-end. You’ll be part of key decisions on how we build and scale, working alongside product managers, designers, and fellow engineers. You'll also implement AI features into our products, integrating with machine learning models, and crafting intelligent user experiences that leverage the latest AI technologies.

As our Backend Engineer, you'll design and scale backend infrastructure that powers LLMs and intelligent AI agents used across legal workflows.** 




  





**About Zeno** 




 Zeno is a legal AI startup building the next generation of intelligent software for legal professionals. The legal world runs on documents, context, and nuance — and we’re building AI tools that deeply understand that. Our end\-to\-end platform combines advanced language models, retrieval systems, and document intelligence to support the full legal workflow: from research and drafting to bulk contract review.
 



 We’re not just building features — we’re rethinking how legal knowledge work is done. Our clients include top\-tier law firms (50\+ FTE), and we’ve secured €2M in funding. Everything we build is hosted securely in Europe, fully ISO 27001 certified.
 



 What makes us unique is our approach: no shallow AI integrations, but agentic systems designed for real\-world performance and legal\-grade reliability. Everything is built in\-house by a small team of highly technical founders (backgrounds in AI, theoretical physics, infra), based in Rotterdam.
 



 You’ll join us at a pivotal moment. The foundation is there, the traction is real, and we’re scaling. As engineer \#5 or \#6, you’ll shape what Zeno becomes — in code, architecture, and culture.
 



  





**Use AI to help legal professionals think, reason, and draft smarter.** 




  





**Architect the systems that turn AI into real\-world legal tools** 




 Zeno’s platform depends on fast, scalable, and secure backend systems to make complex legal workflows usable and intelligent. As a Backend Engineer, you’ll take the lead in designing robust API infrastructure that enables our AI agents to reason over legal content, process documents at scale, and deliver precise outputs to our users. This role combines architectural thinking with hands\-on development — perfect for engineers who want to shape the core of an AI\-first product.
 



  





**What you'll do:** 



* Design and build RESTful APIs (FastAPI) that power our core platform features
* Integrate backend systems with AI agents, document parsers, and retrieval pipelines
* Own the backend for core legal workflows: from document upload to AI\-generated output
* Monitor and improve backend performance, reliability, and security
* Collaborate with AI engineers to align infrastructure with model needs and constraints



  





**What we're looking for:** 



* 3\+ years of backend experience with Python, ideally using FastAPI
* Experience with relational (PostgreSQL) and/or graph/vector databases (e.g. GraphDB, Pinecone)
* Solid understanding of API architecture, service orchestration, and system design
* Someone who likes to build clean, maintainable systems with real\-world usage in mind



  





**What we offer:** 



* A unique opportunity to work at a startup that is shaping the future of legal tech
* The ability to make a direct and tangible impact on the development and growth of our platform
* An inspiring place to work in an office located at the heart of Rotterdam
* Collaboration with a top\-tier team of engineers, researchers, and entrepreneurs
* Competitive compensation, including growth and equity opportunities within the company



  





**Recruitment process via Haystack People** 




 Zeno works exclusively with Haystack People to fill these key roles. Haystack helps us connect with engineers who can build exceptional systems and thrive in a culture of autonomy, focus, and momentum. You’ll be supported throughout the process — from first intro to final offer — by an experienced consultant who understands both the role and the team behind it. Interested or have questions?

Additionally, you will assist our client teams in developing strategies and technology roadmaps for implementing processes and operating systems that support applications connected to digital service operations.
As part of your role, you will help clients imagine and implement the future of service delivery—where AI, GenAI, and agentic technologies are reshaping how services are designed, delivered, and scaled.
You will work with cross\-functional teams to explore AI\-native operating models, integrate intelligent agents into service ecosystems, and help client’s future\-proof their service strategies by embedding emerging technologies across front\- and back\-office operations.
While hands\-on experience in these areas is a plus, what matters most is your ability to think ahead, connect technology to business outcomes, and inspire bold change.
You will also gain new skills and build on the strengths you bring to the firm. You will receive exceptional training, frequent coaching, and ongoing mentoring from colleagues and senior leaders on your teams.
As part of our two\-year Operations Excellence Program (OEP), you will work on client engagements in the same way as any other McKinsey consultant. You will gain leading edge operations and consultancy skills, primarily through on\-the\-job coaching, which will be complemented by the OEP’s structured capability\-building program.
We view the OEP position as the start of a rewarding, challenging and highly flexible career with McKinsey and the Operations practice. During your first few years with the firm, you will serve as a junior practice specialist on multiple client engagements and work with a number of colleagues and clients in a range of industry and operations service lines. You will acquire the necessary knowledge and expertise to help companies achieve excellence in their operations.
Along with other members of the OEP community, you will dedicate many days to functional training and knowledge development under the leadership of our operations experts. You will follow a curriculum based on operations excellence themes and will receive advanced training in one of six specific areas of operations: manufacturing, product development, purchasing, service operations, supply chain management, or capital excellence.
Upon completion of the program, successful consultants will join our global group of leading experts in operational excellence. We already have OEP graduates working at all levels of the firm from associate to partner.
Your application should be in English and include your CV and your transcripts (high school, university, etc.), indicating all relevant grades.

At Stacks, we’re transforming the way finance teams approach one of their most critical processes: the monthly close.

**Job Description**
 Direct Air Capture (DAC) is seen as a key actor in achieving net zero emissions by 2050\. This technology can achieve net negative emissions by capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide. The majority of the costs of DAC are associated with energy expense for sorbent regeneration, and replacement of sorbent material due to degradation. In current DAC devices with a granular sorbent bed, a notable part of energy is used by fans to move large amounts of air through the sorbent. The fan power is proportional to the pressure drop over the bed, a parameter largely controlled by the structure of the sorbent.
   

  

**Required**
 Monoliths acting as sorbent support are known to be advantageous compared to packed beds because of the lower pressure drop and energy required, while CO₂ adsorption capacity is maintained. Nonetheless, commercially available monoliths have not been optimised for DAC applications. For instance, geometry could be optimised for heat and mass transfer, sorbent lifetime, and to minimise sorbent amounts required. In addition, current sorbent\-based DAC processes operate in batch\-wise mode. Continuous operation is often regarded as the most productive configuration in the process industry, and it presents technical advantages over cyclic DAC operation. Therefore, in this project, we will design, fabricate, test and model monolith structures for continuous DAC operation. The steps towards this include:
   

  

* Designing a range of monolith geometries for DAC application and setting up multiphysics (coupled flow, heat, and mass transfer) simulations of these geometries.
* Interpreting numerical results to select the most promising geometries.
* Fabricating monolith samples using advanced additive manufacturing techniques and functionalising them through impregnation or grafting.
* Constructing a test set\-up for breakthrough testing of these samples.
* Validating simulations using experimental results, and combining both to recommend optimal monolith structures for scale\-up.


 For this 2\-year project, we seek a motivated postdoc researcher with a passion for engineering and sustainability. The prospective researcher will work closely with dr.ir. Tim M.J. Nijssen. Furthermore, we will meet regularly with Skytree BV to ensure alignment between this numerical project and their experimental campaign. You will be welcomed in the Engineering Thermodynamics section within the department of Process \& Energy. Our section is focussed on the complex interplay between thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer and chemistry found in process equipment, and aim to understand these phenomena to design materials, devices and processes for a sustainable economy.
   

  

**Job Requirements**
 We seek a motivated, conscientious researcher (x/f/m) with strong communication and self\-management skills, who is passionate about contributing to a solution for climate change.
   

  

**The Successful Candidate**
* Holds (or is soon to obtain) a doctorate degree in mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, or a similar field.
* Has experience in (multiphysics) CFD simulatinos (e.g. in OpenFOAM, COMSOL, etc.).
* Has experience in material preparation and testing (e.g. in adsorption, absorption, membranes, catalysis, etc.).

----------------


Retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG) has become more and more popular due to its potential to achieve comparable performance with smaller models compared with large LLM modes. In the RAG architecture, the knowledge is embedded and stored in external vector databases for retrieval of relevant knowledge by the LLMs instead of the model weights during training. To process a user query, the RAG framework first retrieves relevant knowledge from the vector database, and this knowledge is fed to the generator (an LLM) as external knowledge to generate the final answer. Advanced RAG frameworks retrieve the knowledge from the vector database multiple times during the generation. Thus, the vector database plays an important role in the end\-to\-end performance of RAG such as accuracy and latency. However, RAG also brings new challenges to vector databases as the ever\-increasing size of datasets cannot fit into the main memory and thus needs to be offloaded to SSDs.  

  

The aim of this exploratory project is to understand what roles VectorDB plays in the performance of overall RAG pipelines, and how modern fast storage help accelerate the performance of VectorDBs.

**Your duties**


* Building programs that investigates the differences in latency, throughput, and scalability of different vector database and indexing algorithms.
* Investigating how the performance of vector databases affect the end\-to\-end performance of RAG.
* Help with building the next generation of vector databases for the RAG workloads.

* Experience with Linux
* Experience with database systems, large language models, and RAG is preferred but not mandatory
* Experience with ML frameworks such as PyTorch is preferred but not mandatory

 Jouw functie
   

  

 Retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG) has become more and more popular due to its potential to achieve comparable performance with smaller models compared with large LLM modes. In the RAG architecture, the knowledge is embedded and stored in external vector databases for retrieval of relevant knowledge by the LLMs instead of the model weights during training. To process a user query, the RAG framework first retrieves relevant knowledge from the vector database, and this knowledge is fed to the generator (an LLM) as external knowledge to generate the final answer. Advanced RAG frameworks retrieve the knowledge from the vector database multiple times during the generation. Thus, the vector database plays an important role in the end\-to\-end performance of RAG such as accuracy and latency. However, RAG also brings new challenges to vector databases as the ever\-increasing size of datasets cannot fit into the main memory and thus needs to be offloaded to SSDs.
   

  

 The aim of this exploratory project is to understand what roles VectorDB plays in the performance of overall RAG pipelines, and how modern fast storage help accelerate the performance of VectorDBs.
 
**Your duties**
* Building programs that investigates the differences in latency, throughput, and scalability of different vector database and indexing algorithms.
* Investigating how the performance of vector databases affect the end\-to\-end performance of RAG.
* Help with building the next generation of vector databases for the RAG workloads.

 Your function
   

  

 Retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG) has become more and more popular due to its potential to achieve comparable performance with smaller models compared with large LLM modes. In the RAG architecture, the knowledge is embedded and stored in external vector databases for retrieval of relevant knowledge by the LLMs instead of the model weights during training. To process a user query, the RAG framework first retrieves relevant knowledge from the vector database, and this knowledge is fed to the generator (an LLM) as external knowledge to generate the final answer. Advanced RAG frameworks retrieve the knowledge from the vector database multiple times during the generation. Thus, the vector database plays an important role in the end\-to\-end performance of RAG such as accuracy and latency. However, RAG also brings new challenges to vector databases as the ever\-increasing size of datasets cannot fit into the main memory and thus needs to be offloaded to SSDs.
   

  

 The aim of this exploratory project is to understand what roles VectorDB plays in the performance of overall RAG pipelines, and how modern fast storage help accelerate the performance of VectorDBs.
 
**Your duties**
* Building programs that investigates the differences in latency, throughput, and scalability of different vector database and indexing algorithms.
* Investigating how the performance of vector databases affect the end\-to\-end performance of RAG.
* Help with building the next generation of vector databases for the RAG workloads.

Smart lighting goes far beyond simply switching lights on and off. We leverage the wireless mesh networks we create to control lighting as a backbone for making buildings smarter. This enables use cases such as tracking medical equipment, people counting, climate monitoring, and more.
 


* Our solution excels in the strength of our wireless mesh network, which is far more scalable and robust than any of our competitors. This enables us to cover cases and buildings that no one else can, such as explosion\-proof environments (refineries, mines), container ships, and similar challenging locations. We achieve this in collaboration with our wireless partner
 **Wirepas** 
 , which provides industry\-leading IoT technology.



 The future of our solution is bright. Industry giants like
 **ABB, Siemens, and Schneider Electric** 
 have announced plans to develop a new standard for wireless smart buildings using the same Wirepas technology that we use. This puts us in a leading global position to provide lighting control within this new standard.
 



  





 Our solution is deployed worldwide through partners such as Trilux, Royal BAM, Equans, and Schneider Electric, operating in countries including the U.S., Australia, South Korea, Brazil, France, the UK, and many more. Despite our global reach and collaboration with multi\-billion\-dollar clients, we remain a small, agile team (currently 15 people). We maintain short lines of communication and a fast\-paced, startup mentality. Expect to work closely with customers, see your code deployed on large\-scale sites rapidly, and make meaningful contributions to advancing our product. This is not the place for someone looking to hide in a corner and simply tick off tasks!
 



  





**You Role \& Responsibilities** 




 Ingy provides firmware to dozens of hardware partners in China, Europe, and the U.S., each manufacturing hundreds of different devices with various sensor technologies (PIR, microwave, camera), communication protocols (relay, DALI, 0\-10V), and beyond\-lighting capabilities (people counting, climate monitoring, asset tracking, indoor navigation). Ingy has deployed numerous large\-scale projects in warehouses, logistics centers, and office buildings, involving thousands of devices. These require large\-scale networks, high uptime, robust update processes, and—above all—high\-quality embedded software.
 



  





**Example of Projects You'll Be Working On** 



* Developing a distributed time\-scheduling mechanism that is resilient to power outages, including planned downtime over weekends or holidays.
* Creating a distributed record\-based system to store global and third\-party device configuration data within the network itself, ensuring robustness against node failures and replacements.
* Enhancing commissioning speed using advanced techniques such as augmented reality, autonomous robots, computer vision, and smart constraint satisfaction algorithms on RSSI graphs across wireless nodes.
* Strengthening our security protocols, including secure network joining and utilizing embedded secure elements in partner hardware.



  





**About the Team** 




 Ingy is a fast\-paced startup transitioning into a scale\-up. We have built a highly skilled, ambitious team with expertise across front\-end, cloud, gateways, and firmware. While everyone has at least one specialization, we value flexibility and encourage team members to expand their skills into at least one or two additional areas.
 



 We foster a culture of continuous learning and support personal growth. There are no rigid career steps—you can grow as quickly and in whatever direction suits you best, whether it's deep algorithmic coding, architecture, customer interaction, project management, Scrum mastery, or product management.
 



 Collaboration is key. All code is peer\-reviewed, and we see this as an opportunity to become better engineers every day. You are expected to actively contribute to the growth of your colleagues whenever possible.
 



 We also embrace innovation and strongly encourage you to explore and apply the latest LLM tools to enhance productivity and code quality.
 



 Our team is heavily technology\-focused—expect lunchtime discussions on everything from Minecraft to the validity of the Chinese Room Argument. And yes,
 *42* 
 is always a good answer.
 



  





**Your Skills \& Qualifications** 




 We are hiring for a junior position (0\-3 years of experience). While we welcome candidates with a broad skill set and diverse interests, you must have embedded programming experience. This could come from your education, graduation project, or personal work, but it must be real embedded programming—not just writing C in a non\-embedded setting.
 



  





**Must\-Have Skills** 




 Strong understanding of embedded system limitations, including:
 


* Optimizing for size and memory usage
* Debugging embedded systems
* Understanding compilers and linkers
* Mitigating flash wear
* Hardware peripherals, TIMERs, ADC, PWM, PPI
* Familiarity with hardware devices, especially Nordic Semiconductor and Silicon Labs chips
* Knowledge of wireless systems, including protocols, OTA updates, and distributed sensor networks
* Understanding of authentication, authorization, encryption schemes, and licensing methods



  





**Bonus Skills (Highly Valued)** 



* Experience with React, AWS, Docker, Python
* Personal IoT projects or an active GitHub portfolio



  





**Reasons NOT to apply (or do a test)** 




 Only apply when:
 


* You actually have experience with embedded firmware on the level of connecting hardware peripherals with PPI.
* You are physically located right now in the Netherlands.
* You are allowed to work in the Netherlands indefinitely (no temporary work visa).
* You are aware of the salary brackets and it matches your salary expectations.

**About The Role**
 We're pioneering the future of sales with our GTM Engineering team—reimagining traditional sales roles by collapsing SDRs, AEs, and sales engineers into a single, high\-leverage function. As a GTM Engineer at Lleverage.ai, you'll design and build scalable revenue\-generating systems rather than simply executing manual outreach.
   

  

 Unlike traditional sales roles where individual effort determines success, you'll create automated workflows that can reach thousands of prospects without adding headcount—similar to how engineering teams build software that serves millions without requiring more engineers.
   

  

**Why Lleverage?**
* Change the world, literally: 2025 is the year AI works, and Lleverage.ai is at the forefront of making AI accessible and valuable for businesses
* Work, learn, have fun: You'll be part of a technical sales team that thinks and operates like product builders
* Build a unique network: Connect with decision\-makers and technical leaders across industries as you help them implement AI solutions
* Get autonomy \& ownership: Build and own entire revenue\-generating systems rather than just hitting call quotas
* Compensation: We pay top of market cash and equity, with compensation tied to the value you create, not just activities you perform


**Responsibilities**
* Design Revenue Systems: Create scalable, automated systems for prospect research, personalized outreach, and lead qualification
* Generate Pipeline: Build processes that drive demand at 10x the scale of traditional SDR teams
* Close Deals: Take ownership of the entire sales cycle from initial contact to closed deal
* Technical Consultation: Provide expert product guidance and help prospects understand how to transform their own operations with AI
* Build Automation: Leverage our platform, LLMs, and other tools to automate personalized outreach at scale
* Measure \& Optimize: Continuously improve your systems based on data and results
* Product Feedback: Share insights from customer interactions to help shape our product roadmap
* Technical Workshopping: Help customers implement and get maximum value from our platform


**Job Specific Requirements**
* Systems Thinking: Ability to design scalable processes rather than just executing manual tasks
* Technical Curiosity: Comfortable learning and using new tools to automate sales processes
* Sales Acumen: Strong interpersonal skills and ability to guide prospects through complex buying decisions
* Product Understanding: Capacity to quickly develop deep product knowledge and explain technical concepts clearly
* Data\-Driven: Experience using data to measure results and optimize processes
* High Agency: Self\-starter who can identify problems and implement solutions independently
* Automation Experience: Background working with sales or marketing automation tools
* Communication Skills: Excellent written and verbal communication for both technical and non\-technical audiences


**Nice to haves**
* Experience using or building with AI/LLM tools for sales or marketing
* Background in a technical or product role with customer\-facing responsibilities
* Experience with CRM customization, data enrichment tools, or sales automation platforms
* Understanding of data pipelines and how to structure data for sales intelligence
* Previous experience in a hybrid commercial/technical role
* A carry\-on ice cream bar (it's becoming our thing)


**Our approach to GTM engineering**
 Our GTM Engineers combine three traditional roles:
   

  

* Generate pipeline through automated systems (traditionally SDR work)
* Close existing pipeline through consultative selling (traditionally AE work)
* Technical workshopping to help customers implement solutions (traditionally Sales Engineer work)


 This creates tighter feedback loops, better customer experiences, and more valuable product insights—all while achieving more efficient revenue growth.

1. **Apply:** 

 Apply here or email your CV \& GitHub link to suraj@woub.chat
2. **Introduction (call or video):** 

 We call or video call to see if we click
3. **1st Interview:** 

 You talk to our tech leads and stakeholders. We dive a little deeper into the content – about your experience, our tech, and how you like to work.
4. **Case/Assignment:** 

 Are we both enthusiastic? Then you will get a small case or assignment to show how you think, build, and make choices. We keep it relevant and realistic.

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

We see this way of working as a perfect fit to maintain and increase engagement with customers, the organization, and team members. As a team, we set clear goals and results, giving the development team the freedom to decide how best to achieve them.


What will you be doing?

* Utilize big data technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases to manage and analyze large datasets.
* Collaborate with a scrum team to achieve project goals and meet OKRs, employing agile methodologies and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.
* Serve as the sole expert on AI/ML within the team, demonstrating a high level of self\-reliance and autonomy in decision\-making.
* Educate and mentor other developers on AI/ML concepts and techniques, including neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP).
* Communicate complex AI/ML concepts to stakeholders in simple and understandable terms, ensuring alignment with business objectives and technical feasibility.

What are we offering:


* Projects that truly impact people and society.
* A meaningful career with learning and development opportunities.
* A good salary, a year\-end bonus, and a personal choice budget.
* 28 vacation days, with the possibility to buy or sell leave days.

**Qualifications:**


* Proven experience in AI and Machine Learning, with expertise in algorithms such as regression, classification, clustering, and reinforcement learning.

* Proficiency in programming languages such as Python and SQL, as well as frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit\-learn.
* A good command of the English language in both spoken and written forms. Proficiency in Dutch is valued.
* It is not mandatory, but a plus when you have experience in / knowledge of version control tools (GIT is preferred), geographic information systems (GIS), and tools like FME, ArcGIS en QGIS.

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:

Furthermore, with some own initiative and a good portion of curiosity, you are able to continue your career at Thales at a completely different department.

Join our team developing cutting\-edge models that formalise the connection between musical works in training data, generative music models, and their outputs.
   

  

 Join our research team!
   

  

 We want you to reimagine the future of creative AI attribution rather than just looking for ‘plagiarism’. Your research will help establish ethical frameworks for AI music creation that balance the interests of artists, the creative industries, and technological advancement. You will be collaborating with an interdisciplinary team of musicologists, legal scholars, and labour\-market specialists on the project ‘Fair Remuneration in Times of Generative AI: A Reality Check for the Dutch Music Sector’. In partnership with industry\-leading rights organisations, our goal at the end of the project is to recommend concrete policies for remunerating Dutch artists and rightsholders for the use of their music in AI training.
   

  

 This is what you will do
   

  

 Your work within this project will assess the extent to which current AI models incorporate specific copyrighted works and pioneer new methods for examining how traces of the training data appear within music embeddings and are regenerated in AI compositions. We are looking to quantify the influence of training examples on AI music compositions and use cutting\-edge explainable AI techniques to analysing their encoding paths within the ‘brain’ of generative AI systems. During your contract, you will produce a prototype assessment model for artist remuneration based on diagnostic classifiers, which we will release as open\-source software in tandem with a high\-impact journal or conference paper.
   

  

 Overall, we are striving to balance two competing societal objectives: fair remuneration of artists for using their work in training AI models that may potentially replace them at lower cost vs. ensuring that AI models are able to be trained on a sufficiently rich corpus of source material that artists will also benefit from revolutionary new tools that can support or even enhance their creativity.
   

  

 Your tasks will be:
   

  

* design and conduct research under the guidance of the project leader, resulting in at least one peer\-reviewed academic publication in international scientific conferences or journals;
* develop statistical models for assessing the relative contribution of training materials to generative music models and outputs;
* co\-organise expert meetings or symposia involving industrial and legal partners in the field; and
* contribute collaboratively to the software infrastructure of the Amsterdam Music Lab.


 This is what we ask of you
   

  

* a PhD in artificial intelligence, machine learning, audio signal processing, music technology, or a related field (although candidates with a related master's degree and relevant industrial experience can also be considered);
* demonstrable experience working with recent AI models for music or audio generation;
* experience presenting scientific results at international conferences or publishing in leading international scientific journals;
* a strong cooperative attitude and willingness to engage in collaborative research;
* enthusiasm for communicating academic research to non\-academic audiences;
* excellent social, communication, and organisational skills; and
* excellent command of written and spoken English.


 This is what we offer you
   

  

* a 12\-month researcher 4 (postdoc) contract starting 1 June 2025, with a probation period of 2 months;
* technical support from scientific programmers;
* excellent possibilities for further professional development and education;
* an enthusiastic and professional academic team;
* an inspiring academic and international work environment in the heart of Amsterdam; and
* the opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers and partners in the music industry.

----------------------------

***For this role we do not need to recruit abroad.***


The Senior Data Scientist at Odido develops and applies predictive models that have an impact on commercial performance and customer\-related processes. You are a real specialist. Important here is your deep knowledge of both data science and telecom. Ideally, you already have knowledge on designing human\-like interactions enabling direct customer interaction on multiple channels. Most of the time you will be working on Natural Language Processing (chatbot and voice\-bot), using generative models to help business partners to work more efficiently or help customers find their answers.


The role would be focused on scaling up and expanding the current initiatives using the latest Generative AI models. We use the models to help our colleagues internally to efficiently do their work. For instance, by creating RAG models to support our customer support agents. You would also be working on setting the techniques up to support customers directly with questions they are having.


Furthermore, you will be working with multi\-departmental teams where you have to be fully competent in different areas by showing business value through POCs and converting them into production\-worthy systems together with data engineers. Also, for explaining complex information to others, communication, tact and diplomacy skills are needed. You will be working very close to direct customer feedback. In this role you can help us to become a truly data\-driven organization. Working within an informal atmosphere where you have a lot of freedom to work as the data scientist you want to be. How good is that!


*Depending on your ambitions, there is also room to grow into a more product\-oriented role. In time, you may take partial ownership of the AI roadmap alongside our Product Lead AI Platform – bringing your technical perspective into strategic planning while remaining deeply rooted in hands\-on data science work (roughly 70/30 split).*


**With whom will you work?**


The Senior Data Scientist will be in the Data Science team, which is a part of the Information Technology department (IT). We have a diverse team with people from 4 continents! You will work with non\-technical customers and technical colleagues. The departments where you will be working with are the end\-users of the models (B2C, B2B, Finance or Technology). From the very beginning our models and processes are designed to go to production. You will see your models in action!


**Together we are**
-------------------


We are Odido, the new provider of mobile, fiber optic and TV. And with almost 2,000 colleagues, we show that telecom can be improved. Because technology is for everyone. Wherever you come from, wherever you go. With Odido everyone participates in the digital world. That is our ambition. Everyone at Odido helps to build a brand that is human, optimistic and progressive.


Is that really something for you? Then we might fit well together.


**This is what we stand for**
-----------------------------


Our name \- you can also read it from back to front \- consists of different shapes. Which together are one. Because that's how we look at the world around us. As a place where people, no matter how different, move forward together. We're there for each other. We always look at opportunities. We celebrate diversity and are committed to an inclusive work environment with equal opportunities for all. That sounds good of course. But we don't stop at fine words: at Odido we are a recognized Top Employer. A confirmation that we are proud of.


**What we offer**
-----------------

* Good salary and variable bonus scheme;
* Hybrid working;
* A progressive pension scheme;
* 30 vacation days (if you work for us full\-time) and an extra day off after Ascension Day;
* Redeemable holidays;
* An Odido subscription;
* Real growth opportunities;
* Personal annual learning budget and over 200 digital training and courses;
* Workshops, learning weeks, annual ski trip, fun outings and parties.


**You bring this**
------------------


Some things you cannot learn in a book or school, but you possess them by nature. Your core personality is empathic, decisive, humorous, people\-focused, authentic, and honest. You know the difference between managing and coaching and understand when to apply which. You embrace challenges and are eager to grow. These are traits we are looking for not only in managerial positions but in every member at every level of Odido!


* Master (WO) degree in AI, Machine Learning, Data Science
* Deep knowledge of AI/ML, 3\-6 years’ experience as (Senior) Data Scientist and preferably experience in telecom
* Knowledge of GenAI: LLM (essential) and text2image (nice2have)

* Know how to work with different algorithms (from deep learning, regression, decision trees, gradient boosting, reinforcement learning).
