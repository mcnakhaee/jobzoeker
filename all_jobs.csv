**The Opportunity: Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst**


We are looking for an experienced Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst to take a lead role in transforming data into actionable insights that drive strategic decision\-making across the company. In this hands\-on role, you will design and deliver business\-critical dashboards and analytical reports that inform how we improve patient access and grow our business. As a senior individual contributor on our Data \& Analytics team, you’ll work alongside a Data Engineer and fellow Analysts within our Product \& Engineering organization. You will collaborate cross\-functionally with stakeholders in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial, and Product, becoming a go\-to expert for data insights.


**What You'll be Doing:**


In your first 3–6 months, you will hit the ground running by spearheading the creation of several high\-impact dashboards, including:

* Client Program Performance Dashboards – to monitor and visualize our patient programs' performance and identify opportunities to improve outcomes.
* Revenue Tracking Dashboards – to provide real\-time visibility into revenue streams and financial KPIs, helping steer commercial strategy.
* Patient Source Attribution Dashboards – to trace and illustrate how patients find our platform (using tools like Sankey diagrams for flow visualization), informing marketing and outreach efforts.

**This is the right opportunity for you if:**

* Design, build, and maintain interactive dashboards and reports in Tableau (and other BI tools) to track key metrics across the business. You will own end\-to\-end dashboard development – from gathering requirements to data modeling and visualization – ensuring stakeholders have self\-service access to up\-to\-date insights.
* Deliver actionable insights for growth: Analyze operational and marketing data (from MySQL/PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases, Airflow, Excel, etc.) to understand key performance drivers. Translate data into clear findings and recommendations that drive user acquisition, patient engagement, and sustainable business growth.
* Be the analytical partner for leadership: Serve as a point of contact for the leadership team on all things data. Provide in\-depth reporting, ad\-hoc analysis, and executive\-friendly dashboards that inform strategic decisions and highlight trends in business performance.
* Focus on data quality and accuracy: Work closely with our Data Engineer and product engineers to ensure we have reliable, well\-structured data. Help maintain and validate data models, databases and data pipelines so that reports are accurate and reflect the single source of truth. Identify any data gaps or integrity issues and collaborate on solutions.
* Drive performance improvements: Monitor key KPIs (such as program success metrics, funnel conversion rates, revenue metrics) and proactively identify operational bottlenecks or areas for improvement. Provide insight\-driven suggestions to optimize workflows, improve patient recruitment, or streamline processes.
* Cross\-functional collaboration: Partner with teams in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial and Product to understand their analytics needs. Support these stakeholders by building custom reports or exploratory analysis, and ensure they can leverage your dashboards for day\-to\-day decision making. For example, you might deep\-dive into marketing funnel data to advise the Growth team, or analyze operational turnaround times to assist the Operations team.
* Advanced analysis and data exploration: Use Python (with pandas, numpy, etc.) and SQL for deeper ad\-hoc analyses, data discovery, and data preparation. When questions go beyond existing reports, you’ll dig into raw data to uncover insights, validate hypotheses, and prepare datasets for further analysis.
* Mentorship and best practices: As a senior analyst, mentor and guide junior analysts on the team. Review their work, share knowledge of best practices in analytics, SQL querying, and visualization. Lead by example in documentation and reproducibility. You will also enable business users’ self\-service by training stakeholders on how to use established dashboards and reporting tools effectively.
* Shape data strategy: Contribute to our overall data strategy by identifying new metrics or analytics opportunities that can drive value. Advocate for a data\-driven mindset across the organization. You’ll play a key role in evolving our analytics capabilities (for instance, suggesting new BI features or improving reporting processes) to support a scaling, high\-growth environment.

**You Have:**

* Experience: 5\+ years in data analytics, business intelligence, or a similar role, with a track record of handling complex data projects and delivering insights to business stakeholders. Experience in a growth\-stage tech company or digital health environment is a plus.
* Strong proficiency in SQL (ability to write complex queries in MySQL/PostgreSQL). Hands\-on experience with data visualization tools, especially Tableau (or similar BI platforms), to create dynamic dashboards. Familiarity with NoSQL databases and tools like Airflow is beneficial. Advanced Excel skills for quick analysis and data prep.
* Experience using Python for data analysis tasks – e.g. data cleaning, exploration, and validation using libraries such as pandas or numpy. Must be comfortable scripting to manipulate data when needed.
* Present data in a clear and compelling way. Experience creating a variety of chart types and visuals – from standard bar/line charts to more advanced visuals like Sankey diagrams or funnel charts – to illustrate user flows and attribution. An eye for design and attention to detail in dashboards ensuring they are accurate, easy to interpret, and visually engaging.
* Analytical Mindset: Excellent analytical and problem\-solving skills. Capable of interpreting complex datasets, identifying trends and outliers, and connecting the dots between data and business outcomes. You approach problems with curiosity and a hypothesis\-driven mindset.
* Business Acumen: Strong understanding of business metrics and growth drivers. Ability to translate business questions from non\-technical stakeholders into analytical approaches, and then translate back findings into business terms. Experience working on metrics like revenue, conversion funnels, customer acquisition cost, etc., is highly valued.
* Exceptional communication skills in English (our company language). You can distill complex analyses into clear insights and narratives for different audiences. Comfortable presenting findings to senior leadership and guiding discussions on data.
* Collaboration: Proven ability to work cross\-functionally and build positive relationships with diverse teams — from operations managers to product designers. You’re a team player who can align data projects with the needs of multiple departments and manage stakeholder expectations.
* Leadership \& Mentorship: Demonstrated experience mentoring junior analysts or leading analytical projects. You enjoy helping others grow their skills and can influence without formal authority. You’re enthusiastic about sharing knowledge and establishing best practices for analytics within a team.
* Self\-Driven \& Organized: Thrives in a fast\-paced, high\-growth environment. Able to manage and prioritize multiple projects and requests, deliver on deadlines, and adapt to evolving business needs. You take ownership of your work and proactively seek out ways to add value.
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in a relevant field (e.g. Data Science, Statistics, Business, Computer Science, or similar) is preferred, or equivalent practical experience in data analysis roles.

**What we offer**

* Impactful work that helps patients gain access to potentially lifesaving treatments.

In this thesis, you will generate synthetic training data by transforming low\-poly 3D models of hands and feet into photorealistic images with labeled key points. Using techniques like pix2pix GANs, you’ll explore and optimize the process to create a diverse and enriched dataset, enhancing pose estimation models for AI\-driven Parkinson’s symptom analysis.**

**Areas of Interest:** Generative AI, Controllable Image Generation, Few\-shot Learning


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


The examination of Parkinson’s symptoms is highly labor\-intensive, as it requires multiple trained neurologists to thoroughly analyze hand and leg movements. A group of hospitals aims to extend Parkinson’s treatment in the Netherlands to regions where such care is currently unavailable due to a shortage of trained neurologists. To achieve this, they want to make a pre\-selection through the help of AI on a smartphone. Part of the solution is a pose estimation model to track hand and foot movements. However, the current dataset for training the model is neither large nor diverse enough. The goal is to enrich the dataset with highly varied data while minimizing the need for manual effort.


Important features for detecting hands and feet could be better balanced by enriching the training dataset with synthetic data. To prevent manual labeling of the training data, it would be ideal if the ground truth for tracking key points is synthesized along with the training images. By converting low\-poly 3D models with key point rigs into photorealistic images, a synthetic dataset of labeled training images could be generated. Your task will be to investigate how to transform low\-poly models into photorealistic images using AI.

**The Assignment**
------------------


You will create a training dataset consisting of low\-poly 3D body rigs, focusing on the hands and feet. Next, you will explore transforming these low\-poly models into photorealistic images using a pix2pix GAN model. You may also fine\-tune the model to optimize hyperparameters for generating the best results. Your findings will be documented in a thesis and presented during your thesis defense.

However, these systems present challenges, particularly with model agnostic explanations which are more approximations. This includes global and local explanations, with local ones possibly misleading due to their narrow focus. Effective testing is crucial to verify if explanations are sensible to experts, consistent across different outcomes, and to understand when they might change.**

**Areas of Interest:** Artificial Intelligence, Explainable AI


Explainable machine learning and artificial intelligence models have been used to justify a model’s decision\-making process. This added transparency aims to help improve user performance and understanding of the underlying model. However, in practice, explainable systems face many open questions and challenges.


Model agnostic explanations are more approximations. In general there are two kinds of explanations: global and local explanations. For the latter, there’s the possibility that the explanation is off, because it only looks at the local inference. It’s possible that for opposite inference, we get exactly the same explanations. To get proper explanations we’ll need to be able to test them. Are the explanations sensible to business experts and aren’t there any same explanations for opposite outcomes? And do we know when explanations will change?

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

We’re crafting a metric that measures how achievable AI\-generated advice is—for real people. Think of it as teaching AI common sense; for instance, you can’t just age a decade instantly. Your challenge: integrate advanced language models like GPT to gauge if a “what if” scenario is useful or just a tech fantasy. Join us in shaping a more sensible, user\-centric AI future.**

**Areas of Interest:** XAI/Explainable AI, LLMs/Large Language Models, ChatGPT, NLP/Natural Language Processing


Counterfactual explanations are considered an intuitive and user\-friendly form of explainable AI. A counterfactual explanation proposes minimal changes to the input data that would lead to a different model output. As an example, a bank could make use of a model to determine if a customer can get a loan or not. If a customer was denied a loan, a counterfactual explanation could tell them that, for instance, “if their savings were increased by 10\.000€, they could get the loan”.


However, counterfactual explanations are not aware of the semantics of the input features. It might be that the minimal change for a customer to get a loan is to “increase their age from 25 to 35 years old” which, from a human perspective, is evidently unfeasible in a short time span.

**The Assignment**
------------------


In this project, we would like you to design a new evaluation metric to automatically determine the practicality of counterfactuals, that is, how attainable a counterfactual explanation is (or if it is even humanly attainable). Since the determination of practicality involves semantic understanding of the input features, our idea would be to leverage GPT and/or other large language model\-based technologies to accomplish this.


A user study could be conducted initially following the methodology proposed by Spreitzer et al (1\) to evaluate the practicality of different state\-of\-the\-art counterfactual techniques. The user study can then be extended to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed metric compared to the human evaluations.

 What we offer
   

  

**About Us**
 We are Xomnia, the AI consulting company. We’re curious problem solvers who believe data will change the way we live, work and communicate. Being at the forefront of this revolutionary change in a sustainable, positive way is what drives us.
   

  

 We solve challenging data science and engineering projects, from start to finish. From developing an application for real\-time fraud detection on Google Cloud Platform, to setting up a customized recommender engine in an existing Microsoft Azure environment \- we develop and deploy tailor\-made data science solutions.
   

  

 Xomnia started in 2013 in one room in the heart of Amsterdam. These days we take up nearly two houses. But more than just a workspace, we're a community that values authenticity. Here, everyone is encouraged to be themselves, to learn, and to have fun in the process.
   

  

 Representing over 20 nationalities, our team values the unique cultural perspective that each individual brings to the table. Moreover, with the Dutch tech sector seeing a female representation around 11%, we are proud that over 30% of our workforce is female. Nevertheless, we recognize that there is more to be done, and we continue working to overcome barriers that still exist.
   

  

 We encourage all candidates to apply, and we don’t discriminate based on race, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age. However, a reality that we face is that many of our clients prefer to communicate in Dutch, making Dutch proficiency essential for some roles. Additionally, while we wish that we could sponsor visas for everyone, there are instances when it is not feasible.
   

  

 If you're experienced, passionate, and align with our values, we want to hear from you.",Information Technology & Services,https://nl.linkedin.com/company/xomnia,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEMxcvPDbBSiQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1724141336408/xomnia_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=0v5TZXJBHiKRXgKL2iodt4MaQoB-A_OFbbEE8e8kKF0,,,,,,,,,,,,ai engineer,linkedin,en

Our clients offer top\-tier pay for top\-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?
   

  

 Master AI\-Driven Development or Step Aside. For Engineers Who Ship, Not Talk.
   

  

 Most development teams still operate in the dark ages—manual code reviews, reactive debugging, and AI as an afterthought. At Trilogy, we've rewritten the rules. Our entire engineering ecosystem breathes AI—from ideation to deployment, bug detection to optimization. This isn't about occasionally using AI tools; it's about fundamentally transforming how software gets built.
   

  

 We're seeking elite developers who refuse to accept the status quo of traditional software engineering. You'll deconstruct established B2B products and rebuild them as cloud\-native powerhouses with AI intelligence embedded at every level. You'll deploy features that leverage cutting\-edge retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG), automate defect detection, and deliver flawlessly—zero downtime, zero compromises.
   

  

 If you're ready to operate at the bleeding edge where AI meets software engineering, this position will accelerate your career trajectory. If you prefer architecture debates over shipping code or manual processes over automation, look elsewhere.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Harness advanced RAG vector stores and AI analysis tools to systematically identify, diagnose, and eliminate product defects with unprecedented efficiency
* Architect and implement AI development agents that transform how features are designed, developed, and deployed across cloud\-native applications
* Drive enterprise\-grade solutions through strategic collaboration with a distributed global engineering team


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Managing infrastructure overhead: Our streamlined processes eliminate traditional DevOps burdens so you can focus exclusively on high\-impact development
* Sitting through productivity\-killing meetings: We prioritize your technical output over discussion—expect focused collaboration, not endless conversation
* Writing code the conventional way: If your workflow still begins with manual coding rather than AI\-assisted generation, this position isn't aligned with our approach


**Full Stack Developer Key Responsibilities**
 Accelerate business transformation by implementing AI\-driven features that revolutionize service provider workflows and deliver measurable competitive advantage in the market.
   

  

**Basic Requirements**
* Demonstrated AI\-First Development Mindset: You must approach problems by leveraging AI capabilities first, then enhancing with human expertise—not the reverse
* 4\+ years of production software development experience with server\-side web applications
* Proven track record building mission\-critical B2B software applications that meet enterprise reliability standards
* Deep expertise in cloud\-native development and serverless architectures, specifically within AWS environments
* Advanced proficiency with GenAI code assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor.sh, v0\.dev) in professional development contexts
* Verifiable success implementing Generative AI solutions with quantifiable business impact


**About Trilogy**
 Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer\-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon\-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud\-based stack.

 You’ll join 15 analysts in Bol’s advertising analytics organization. Together you share a mission of making people performant through analytics. This role is for the versatile analyst, one that is equally comfortable talking to data as to stakeholders. Your stakeholders can be colleagues from the Advertising and Product domains as well as advertiser customers. Your days vary but at the core you’ll use SQL/Python/Tableau/dbt/git to provide metrics, analysis, and predictions that help advertisers make better decisions.
   

  

 You’ll collaborate with stakeholders to understand business needs, identify key performance metrics, define high value use cases for analytics to help advertising customers make better decisions. Your work will be input for amongst others client meetings, white papers, webinars, and public industry appearances.
   

  

* Analysing advertising KPIs in all stages of the Media Funnel and identifying relevant shopper behaviour across their journeys. You'll use your analytical skills to uncover patterns and insights in our data that help us understand how to optimize the effectiveness of our advertising propositions.
* Working closely with internal stakeholders (Sales, Customer Success, and Marketing) and top advertising and agency customers to identify high value applications of analytics. You use your data expertise to help guide decision\-making processes and ensure that data\-driven insights and recommendations are central to retail media plans.
* Developing extensive domain knowledge across our business to effectively manage and analyse advertising KPIs delivered through presentations, dashboards, white papers or public industry appearances.
* Developing high\-quality data pipelines for dashboarding and KPIs in collaboration with our analytical engineers (using dbt), ensuring that the data we use for reporting and analysis is accurate, complete, and up\-to\-date.
* Writing high\-quality and easily interpretable SQL and Python code that can be reused. You'll use your SQL skills to query large, complex datasets, extracting the data needed to answer key business questions. You'll also ensure that your SQL and Python code is reusable, well\-documented, and easily interpretable by other members of the team.


**Why you can make the difference?**
 You’re an enthusiastic team player who lives and breathes analytics. The ideal candidate for this role has a strong analytical mindset, a healthy appetite for making business impact and excellent communication and collaboration skills. You have experience working with SQL and dashboarding tools like Tableau and are comfortable navigating and analysing large, complex datasets. You also have a knack for translating complex data insights into clear, actionable recommendations.
   

  

**3 reasons why this is (not) for you** 
**Switch to find out**
* \- If you strongly value clarity No, if innovating, autonomy, and ambiguity sound terrifying to you.
* \- You only want to process data No, if you only want to process data and prefer someone else to handle project and stakeholder management.
* \- If you believe analysts don’t need domain knowledge No, if you don't want to dive into the world of advertising. Curiosity and willingness to learn about our domain and customers are key to your success.
* \+ You’re an analytics professional Yes, if you have 5\+ year experience delighting decision makers with your analytical skills. SQL is a must, Python scripting is a strong plus.
* \+ Obsess over creating value for advertisers Yes, if you believe output does not equal outcome and judge success by value creation.
* \+ You get (and create) energy by working with others Yes, if you can translate technical information into language anyone can understand. You enjoy working with both data and people.

Smart lighting goes far beyond simply switching lights on and off. We use our wireless mesh networks to control lighting and serve as a backbone for smarter buildings. This enables use cases such as tracking medical equipment, people counting, climate monitoring, and more.
 



  





 Our solution excels in the strength of our wireless mesh network, which is far more scalable and robust than any of our competitors. This enables us to cover cases and buildings that no one else can, such as explosion\-proof environments (refineries, mines), container ships, and similar challenging locations. We achieve this in collaboration with our wireless partner Wirepas, which provides industry\-leading IoT technology.
 



 The future of our solution is bright. Industry giants like ABB, Siemens, and Schneider Electric have announced plans to develop a new standard for wireless smart buildings using the same Wirepas technology that we use. This puts us in a leading global position to provide lighting control within this new standard. See:
 



  





 Our solution is deployed worldwide through partners such as Trilux, Royal BAM, Equans, and Schneider Electric, operating in countries including the U.S., Australia, South Korea, Brazil, France, the UK, and many more. Despite our global reach and collaboration with multi\-billion\-dollar clients, we remain a small, agile team (currently 15 people). We maintain short lines of communication and a fast\-paced, startup mentality. Expect to work closely with customers, see your code deployed on large\-scale sites rapidly, and make meaningful contributions to advancing our product. This is not the place for someone looking to hide in a corner and simply tick off Jira tickets!
 



  





**Your Role \& Responsibilities** 




 Ingy provides its products for truly large scale installations in warehouses, logistics centers, large office buildings: up to thousands of devices with multiple gateways each connected to the cloud. Ingy is evolving into a scale\-up, prioritizing the automation of provisioning new sites, supporting and diagnosing existing ones, and onboarding new partners. This transition requires a robust cloud infrastructure, where you will play a key role as a main contributor.
 



  





**Examples of Projects You'll Be Working On** 



* Use infrastructure\-as\-code (Terraform) to \- with one click of a button \- deploy our entire infrastructure on thousands of gateways supporting millions of devices.
* Completely revamp our firmware delivery to enable one\-click deployment of new software to hundreds of devices across dozens of manufacturers.
* Create a highly flexible, container\-based infrastructure where Docker containers can be seamlessly moved between gateways and the cloud for an optimal support experience.
* Creating the data infrastructure to store, analyse and display data collected by hundreds of thousands of sensors, sending data every few minutes.
* Add LLM based functionality to analyse and interact with the data stored.



  





**About the Team** 




 Ingy is a fast\-paced startup transitioning into a scale\-up. We have built a highly skilled, ambitious team with expertise across front\-end, cloud, gateways, and firmware. While everyone has at least one specialization, we value flexibility and encourage team members to expand their skills into at least one or two additional areas.
 



 We foster a culture of continuous learning and support personal growth. There are no rigid career steps—you can grow as quickly and in whatever direction suits you best, whether it's deep algorithmic coding, architecture, customer interaction, project management, Scrum mastery, or product management.
 



 Collaboration is key. All code is peer\-reviewed, and we see this as an opportunity to become better engineers every day. You are expected to actively contribute to the growth of your colleagues whenever possible.
 



 We also embrace innovation and strongly encourage you to explore and apply the latest LLM tools to enhance productivity and code quality.
 



 Our team is heavily technology\-focused—expect lunchtime discussions on everything from Minecraft to the validity of the Chinese Room Argument. And yes,
 *42* 
 is always a good answer.
 



  





**Your Skills \& Qualifications** 




 We are hiring for a junior position (0\-3 years of experience). While we welcome candidates with a broad skill set and diverse interests, you must have cloud development experience. This could come from your education, graduation project, or personal work, but you must have used Terraform or an alternative infrastructure\-as\-code approach.
 



  





**Must\-Have Skills** 



* Strong understanding of cloud computing, including:
* Building cloud infrastructure using infrastructure\-as\-code (Terraform)
* Good understanding of security principles (ideally tailored to AWS services and in general, no use of long\-term credentials, secure in transit and at rest, traceability, etc.)
* Containerization, dockers, orchestration
* Familiarity with cloud infrastructure, especially AWS (Cognito, Timestream, IoTcore, IoT greengrass)
* Knowledge of GitHub/Bitbucket pipelines, REST interfaces, the MQTT protocol, Linux systems, DNS records
* Understanding of trade\-offs between creating scalable services (in the cloud) and keeping things local from perspectives of availability, pricing, latency, etc.



  





**Bonus Skills (Highly Valued!)** 



* Experience with Python, Javascript, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Pulumi, Raspberry PIs
* Personal IoT projects or an active GitHub portfolio

Yes, we’re looking for a Full\-stack web developer. And yes, there are plenty of other opportunities out there. If you’re exploring your options, you might be thinking about growth, creativity, a sense of purpose, or just a healthier work\-life balance. We get it—everyone wants their own version of a “perfect fit.”
 



  




 So here’s why you might consider AIAIAI:
 
  





 We’re an early\-stage startup with significant traction, on track to become cashflow positive this year—so there’s no frantic chasing of funding to stay afloat. Our team is small (currently 8 of us) by design, and we plan to grow to around 15 by the end of the year to ensure profitability. From there, we’ll scale linearly—about 3–5 new hires a month—depending on our sales results.
 



  





 You’ll be working with an experienced development team that’s already built and scaled successful SAAS products. AIAIAI itself was born out of two sister companies, Lifely and Nucleoo, giving you access to a broader network of colleagues and experts in Amsterdam, Granada, and Madrid. We hope you look back in 20 years and say, “That’s where I did some of the most impactful and fulfilling work of my life.”
 



  





 AI—yes, it’s a buzzword filled with smoke and mirrors. That’s not us (or at least, we’re trying not to be). Because no matter how slowly actual adoption might be happening, we’re all being affected by AI in one way or another—teachers feeling the pressure to adapt, office employees expected to deliver more in less time. There’s a huge segment of people, especially once you drive a bit outside big cities, who aren’t “prompting” or tapping into AI to boost productivity. Their jobs—and the relevance of their employers—is at risk. That’s what we address at
 



  





 AIAIAI: helping everyday people use AI in a way that feels natural to them. We meet them where they are, instead of asking them to change. We’ve designed our product so that both employees and companies don’t end up saying “AI AI AI” three years from now because they were blindsided. It’s a product being used daily by users who’d typically fall into the late majority or even “laggards” on the adoption curve. And that’s the mission you’d help drive: making a fast\-changing world a bit more manageable for people who just need it to work.
   




 What can you expect from the role?
 
 As our Full\-stack web developer, you’ll help shape the core architecture of our platform—both front\-end and back\-end. You’ll be part of key decisions on how we build and scale, working alongside product managers, designers, and fellow engineers. You'll also implement AI features into our products, integrating with machine learning models, and crafting intelligent user experiences that leverage the latest AI technologies.

As our Backend Engineer, you'll design and scale backend infrastructure that powers LLMs and intelligent AI agents used across legal workflows.** 




  





**About Zeno** 




 Zeno is a legal AI startup building the next generation of intelligent software for legal professionals. The legal world runs on documents, context, and nuance — and we’re building AI tools that deeply understand that. Our end\-to\-end platform combines advanced language models, retrieval systems, and document intelligence to support the full legal workflow: from research and drafting to bulk contract review.
 



 We’re not just building features — we’re rethinking how legal knowledge work is done. Our clients include top\-tier law firms (50\+ FTE), and we’ve secured €2M in funding. Everything we build is hosted securely in Europe, fully ISO 27001 certified.
 



 What makes us unique is our approach: no shallow AI integrations, but agentic systems designed for real\-world performance and legal\-grade reliability. Everything is built in\-house by a small team of highly technical founders (backgrounds in AI, theoretical physics, infra), based in Rotterdam.
 



 You’ll join us at a pivotal moment. The foundation is there, the traction is real, and we’re scaling. As engineer \#5 or \#6, you’ll shape what Zeno becomes — in code, architecture, and culture.
 



  





**Use AI to help legal professionals think, reason, and draft smarter.** 




  





**Architect the systems that turn AI into real\-world legal tools** 




 Zeno’s platform depends on fast, scalable, and secure backend systems to make complex legal workflows usable and intelligent. As a Backend Engineer, you’ll take the lead in designing robust API infrastructure that enables our AI agents to reason over legal content, process documents at scale, and deliver precise outputs to our users. This role combines architectural thinking with hands\-on development — perfect for engineers who want to shape the core of an AI\-first product.
 



  





**What you'll do:** 



* Design and build RESTful APIs (FastAPI) that power our core platform features
* Integrate backend systems with AI agents, document parsers, and retrieval pipelines
* Own the backend for core legal workflows: from document upload to AI\-generated output
* Monitor and improve backend performance, reliability, and security
* Collaborate with AI engineers to align infrastructure with model needs and constraints



  





**What we're looking for:** 



* 3\+ years of backend experience with Python, ideally using FastAPI
* Experience with relational (PostgreSQL) and/or graph/vector databases (e.g. GraphDB, Pinecone)
* Solid understanding of API architecture, service orchestration, and system design
* Someone who likes to build clean, maintainable systems with real\-world usage in mind



  





**What we offer:** 



* A unique opportunity to work at a startup that is shaping the future of legal tech
* The ability to make a direct and tangible impact on the development and growth of our platform
* An inspiring place to work in an office located at the heart of Rotterdam
* Collaboration with a top\-tier team of engineers, researchers, and entrepreneurs
* Competitive compensation, including growth and equity opportunities within the company



  





**Recruitment process via Haystack People** 




 Zeno works exclusively with Haystack People to fill these key roles. Haystack helps us connect with engineers who can build exceptional systems and thrive in a culture of autonomy, focus, and momentum. You’ll be supported throughout the process — from first intro to final offer — by an experienced consultant who understands both the role and the team behind it. Interested or have questions?

Additionally, you will assist our client teams in developing strategies and technology roadmaps for implementing processes and operating systems that support applications connected to digital service operations.
As part of your role, you will help clients imagine and implement the future of service delivery—where AI, GenAI, and agentic technologies are reshaping how services are designed, delivered, and scaled.
You will work with cross\-functional teams to explore AI\-native operating models, integrate intelligent agents into service ecosystems, and help client’s future\-proof their service strategies by embedding emerging technologies across front\- and back\-office operations.
While hands\-on experience in these areas is a plus, what matters most is your ability to think ahead, connect technology to business outcomes, and inspire bold change.
You will also gain new skills and build on the strengths you bring to the firm. You will receive exceptional training, frequent coaching, and ongoing mentoring from colleagues and senior leaders on your teams.
As part of our two\-year Operations Excellence Program (OEP), you will work on client engagements in the same way as any other McKinsey consultant. You will gain leading edge operations and consultancy skills, primarily through on\-the\-job coaching, which will be complemented by the OEP’s structured capability\-building program.
We view the OEP position as the start of a rewarding, challenging and highly flexible career with McKinsey and the Operations practice. During your first few years with the firm, you will serve as a junior practice specialist on multiple client engagements and work with a number of colleagues and clients in a range of industry and operations service lines. You will acquire the necessary knowledge and expertise to help companies achieve excellence in their operations.
Along with other members of the OEP community, you will dedicate many days to functional training and knowledge development under the leadership of our operations experts. You will follow a curriculum based on operations excellence themes and will receive advanced training in one of six specific areas of operations: manufacturing, product development, purchasing, service operations, supply chain management, or capital excellence.
Upon completion of the program, successful consultants will join our global group of leading experts in operational excellence. We already have OEP graduates working at all levels of the firm from associate to partner.
Your application should be in English and include your CV and your transcripts (high school, university, etc.), indicating all relevant grades.

At Stacks, we’re transforming the way finance teams approach one of their most critical processes: the monthly close.

**Dit ga je doen****
 Door de energietransitie neemt ons werk ontzettend toe. Daarom zijn we ons werk aan het verslimmen met behulp van AI, zodat we samen werk kunnen maken van een leefwereld vol nieuwe energie. Dit is een mooie taak voor onze nieuwe Large Language Model (LLM) Ddeveloper collega. Als LLM Developer werk je in het functieteam Generative AI in het Digitale Innovatie \& AI team van Stedin. Het Generative AI team is speciaal opgericht om met volle focus de kansen en mogelijkheden van LLM’s uit te gaan nutten, want de mogelijkheden blijken eindeloos en de vraag uit het bedrijf is enorm. Hierbij draag je ook actief kennis over aan de rest van het bedrijf volgens het principe voordoen, samen doen, controleren.
   

  

**Hoe jouw dag als Large Language Model Developer eruitziet bij Stedin?**
 Na een heerlijke kop koffie (of thee) die je in gebarentaal bij onze ‘gebarista’ (slechthorende barista) hebt besteld, start je jouw dag met een stand\-up waarin je enthousiast de features bespreekt waaraan je werkt. Daarna heb je gelijk een meeting met de Lead Developer en Product Owner. Jullie kijken samen hoe een probleem uit het bedrijf opgelost kan worden met taalmodellen; iets waar de eindklant direct een bedrijfsproces mee kan verbeteren en echt resultaat oplevert voor in onze operatie. Wat zijn de wensen, en kan er direct nog meer waarde gecreëerd worden?
   

  

 Lunchen doe je in het bedrijfsrestaurant op de 18e verdieping, zo geniet je van je eigen of verse lunch en van het uitzicht over heel Rotterdam. Of je loopt even de stad in voor een wandeling. Na de lunch ga je aan de slag met het technisch uitwerken van pilots of opschalingen waar je onder andere Azure OpenAI voor gebruikt. Of je maakt een PoC van een ander taalmodel waarmee je in korte tijd toetst of de oplossing financieel, technisch en functioneel haalbaar is voor Stedin.
   

  

 Als afsluiter heb je nog een meeting met een architect en afdeling security over onze interne chat product StedinGPT. Hier heb je het over de toepasbaarheid van de gemaakte oplossing en hoe die terecht moet komen in het Stedin IT landschap; wat zijn de kaders, is de gemaakte MVP veilig en kunnen we dit in de toekomst beter standaardiseren? Aan het eind van je werkdag sta je in een paar stappen op station Blaak, zo ben je lekker snel weer thuis.
   

  

*‘Wat ik erg tof vind aan mijn werk als LLM Developer bij Stedin, is dat ik maatschappelijke impact maak en werk met de nieuwste AI\-technologieën. In onze Generative AI team ontwikkelen we slimme oplossingen, waarbij we elkaars ideeën versterken, onze passie voor AI delen en altijd de laatste technologische ontwikkelingen volgen.’ Felicia Redelaar, LLM Developer.*
**Jouw sterke punten
   

  

**Worden we blij van****
 Als onderdeel van het snel groeiende Generative AI team ben jij een verantwoordelijk persoon die veelzijdige taken op zich kan nemen en zelfstandig uit kunt werken. Generative AI is nog nieuw maar jij doorziet goed voor welk probleem welke oplossing geschikt is. Naast een dosis creativiteit zorg jij ook dat gemaakte oplossingen veilig zijn en klanten echt geholpen zijn met de eindoplossing. Als we zaken beter anders aanpakken of andere technologie moeten gebruiken om tot meer succes te komen kan je ons hier ook van overtuigen vanuit je technische basis. Je bent niet bang nieuwe ideeën uit te proberen in een PoC, maar bent ook sterk in langdurig goed werkende software af te leveren in productie, terwijl je steeds scherp blijft op het doel en de randvoorwaarden. Ook blijf je up\-to\-date met vernieuwingen op LLM gebied in de markt.
   

  

 Wat jou verder onze nieuwe Large Language Model Developer maakt?
   

  

* Je beschikt over hbo of wo werk\- en denkniveau bij voorkeur op het gebied van IT, AI en/of Computer Science.
* Je hebt kennis en ervaring op het gebied van LLM’s en weet hoe je deze kunt integreren in andere softwareproducten.
* Je beschikt over uitgebreide kennis van Python.
* Je beschikt over uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden en kan duidelijk de consequenties voor IT/technologie keuzes uitleggen aan verschillende doelgroepen. Je kunt wensen ophalen bij de klant en in begrijpelijke taal uitleggen hoe LLM technologie werkt, maar ook inhoudelijk schakelen met Developers van andere teams.
* Pré: ervaring met:
+ Azure (beheer)
+ E eerder LLM producten tot in productie geïmplementeerd.
+ RAG, LangChain
+ Ervaring met CI/CD, bij voorkeur met Azure DevOps
+ Beheersing van SQL
+ Kennis van Infrastructure as Code (IaC), bij voorkeur met Bicep
+ API ontwikkeling


**Goed om te weten:** 
 Bij Stedin hebben we genoeg te doen. Daarom is deze rol voor minimaal 32 uur beschikbaar. Meer uit je rol halen? 36 en 40 uur is ook bespreekbaar!
   

  

**Een goed team
   

  

**Daar hoor je bij****
 Meteen vanaf dag één werk je in het Generative AI team. Dit team opereert als een DevOps team binnen een groot bedrijf en bestaat uit gedreven en enthousiaste Developers, die op zoek zijn samen met de Product Owner naar het toevoegen van waarde d.m.v. Generative AI. Dit snel groeiende team is in staat om snel nieuwe ideeën om te zetten in realiteit binnen de complexe context van de netbeheerder, bijvoorbeeld door het uitvoeren van kleinschalige MVP’s, maar ook het naar productie brengen van Generative AI binnen het IT landschap van Stedin.
   

  

 Ons team werkt met een combinatie van de SAFe methode en probleemgericht innoveren en zorgt daarmee dat het bedrijf sneller en efficiënter kan werken. Daarmee hebben we dus een ontzettend belangrijke rol in het versnellen van de energietransitie! Ondanks dat we met 3 teams samen in onze ART opereren en ieder zijn of haar eigen specialisme heeft, hebben we heel veel contact met elkaar. Bijvoorbeeld als we allemaal samen zitten op onze 2 vaste kantoordagen, om te sparren over de beste oplossingsrichting, om te leren van elkaars ervaringen, tijdens de teamuitjes of met een lekkere kop koffie bij de koffiebar met het dakterras. We zijn goed op elkaar ingespeeld, ieders bijdrage wordt gewaardeerd en, niet onbelangrijk, elke dag moet er gelachen worden!
   

  

**Mooie arbeidsvoorwaarden
   

  

**Die wil je hebben****
 Dat je van ons je eigen telefoon (of een Bring Your Own Device vergoeding) en laptop krijgt, vinden we nogal vanzelfsprekend. Wat mag je nog meer van Stedin als werkgever verwachten?
   

  

 Alle financiële arbeidsvoorwaarden op een rij, weet je meteen waar je aan toe bent:
   

  

* Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden horen erbij. Zo krijg je een (maximaal) salaris van € 5\.700 gebaseerd op 40 uur per week en kennis en ervaring, 24,5 vakantiedagen en bouw je prima pensioen op bij het ABP.
* Boven op je salaris ontvang je een persoonlijk budget van 24% (inclusief 8% vakantiegeld). Jij kiest elke maand wat je met het budget doet. Elke maand extra salaris? (Zo kun je ook € 6\.612 per maand inclusief 16% Persoonlijk Budget verdienen) Of meer verlofdagen? In  onze nieuwe Rekentool  krijg je alvast een voorproefje van hoe jouw persoonlijk budget eruit zou kunnen zien en hoe je het zou kunnen besteden.
* Gezonde energie die heb je nodig. Daarom krijg je van ons ook een Duurzaam Inzetbaarheid budget van €500 bruto per jaar (bijvoorbeeld voor je sportabonnement, een hometrainer of je nieuwe sport outfit).
* Volgens ons Stedin@Work concept werk je 50% thuis en 50% op kantoor, wel zo flexibel. Wij zorgen voor jouw thuiswerkfaciliteiten, een thuiswerkvergoeding en reizen naar kantoor doe je met je OV vrij\-abonnement waarmee je ook buiten werk onbeperkt kan reizen!


**Daar Komt Dit Nog Boven Op**
* Werken bij Stedin betekent werken bij een World\-class Workplace. Een van de trotspunten van onze (en jouw toekomstige) collega’s? Werksfeer.
* Jouw ontwikkeling staat centraal: events bezoeken met collega’s, meedoen aan kennissessies, trainingen en opleidingen volgen. Zo geven we jouw talent écht alle kans en haal jij het beste uit jezelf.
* Goede koffie van Heilige Boontjes.


 We zijn een duurzaam bedrijf. Reis je met het OV naar je werk, dan krijg je van ons een OV Vrij\-abonnement 2e klas. Dit abonnement mag je ook privé gebruiken. Kies je voor een vaste reiskostenvergoeding dan ontvang je 13 cent per kilometer (maximaal 60 kilometer enkele reis) voor de dagen dat je reist voor je werk. Met je Persoonlijk Budget kun je dit aanvullen tot 21 cent netto per kilometer. Krijg je je eigen bedrijfsauto of \-bus, dan mag je deze ook gebruiken voor woon\-werkverkeer. Voor zakelijk verkeer gebruiken we deelauto’s.

Wij geloven in een integrale aanpak van mens, proces, systeem en informatie: de mens werkt in een proces, het proces wordt geborgd in een systeem, uit dit systeem ontsluiten we data, waar we vervolgens informatie voor de mens van maken. Met het inzicht uit deze informatie, stuurt de mens het proces aan.
 



  





 In deze functie ligt de focus ligt op het ontsluiten van data en het vertalen van deze data naar inzichten.

* Je hebt een positieve en proactieve instelling in combinatie met een groot relativeringsvermogen. Het is uiteindelijk maar werk ;).
* Je brengt passie, plezier en af en toe wat gekkigheid. Je krijgt het immers ook terug.
* Je kan goed zelfstandig werken, maar weet ook intern om hulp te vragen waar nodig.
* Jij kan ook goed samenwerken en communiceren, zodat jij bij opdrachtgevers de juiste mensen weet te vinden.
* Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal goed, het draait niet alleen maar om eentjes en nulletjes.
* Je hebt affiniteit met data en processen, of de wens je te verdiepen in de mogelijkheden hiervan. Wij leren je graag de ins en outs!
* Kennis van data analyse, Business Intelligence, Data Science en/of Lean SixSigma is een
 *pré* 
 .



  





**Dit krijg jij ervoor terug** 



* Met een bachelor op zak, ontvang je een minimaal startsalaris van €2\.900,\- op basis van 40 uren per week (of meer, afhankelijk van kennis en/of werkervaring). Aanstelling voor 32 uur ook mogelijk.
* Ruime mobiliteitsregeling: mogelijkheden voor een leaseauto, NS Business Card of ruime reiskostenvergoeding voor eigen vervoer.
* Hybride werken.
* Onbeperkt verlof.
* Een sportieve omgeving. Wil jij een marathon lopen of een toernooi voor het hele team organiseren? Leuk, wij vergoeden het voor je!
* Ruimte om je zowel persoonlijk als inhoudelijk verder te ontwikkelingen met diverse trainingen (denk aan datagedreven werken, verandermanagement en procesoptimalisatie). Allemaal in lijn met jouw eigen ambities.
* Passie en plezier. Naast hard werken vieren wij succes met borrels, uitjes en sportiviteit, zoals ons jaarlijkse skiweekend in Oostenrijk :).

 Als BI Consultant bij Solviteers krijg je de kans om zowel expertise op te bouwen in Business Intelligence als kennis op te doen van de bronapplicaties binnen de overheidssector. Dit biedt een unieke combinatie die snel veel kennis en ervaring oplevert en een sterke positie in de markt mogelijk maakt. De aanwezigheid van ervaren collega’s stimuleert jouw ontwikkeling, net als de complexiteit en uitdagingen tijdens opdrachten. Dagelijks sta je voor complexe puzzels en geniet je van de variatie en uitdaging die de opdrachten bieden, waardoor je voortdurend wordt uitgedaagd en gemotiveerd.
 



  





 Als BI Consultant analyseer je in eerste instantie de informatiebehoefte van de klant en ontwikkel je rapporten en dashboards. Je kunt je specialiseren in het maken van managementinformatie voor diverse bronapplicaties of nieuwe technieken toepassen. Verder kun je je verdiepen in datawarehousing als BI data engineer, een BI\-architectuur ontwikkelen als data architect of voorspellingsmodellen maken als data scientist. Ten slotte kun je een adviserende rol aannemen om klanten te helpen bij het bepalen van hun managementinformatiebehoeften.
 



  





*""Iedere dag krijg je te maken met complexe puzzels en veel afwisseling wat voldoende uitdaging biedt.""* 




  





**Wat je gaat doen** 




 Er zijn vijf hoofdrollen binnen BI, hoewel titels kunnen variëren. Vaak overlappen deze rollen, wat betekent dat je tijdens een opdracht elementen van meerdere rollen kunt tegenkomen.
 



  





 In de basis vraag je bij de klant de behoefte naar managementinformatie uit en vertaal je deze naar een rapport of dashboard. Als BI Consultant richt je je op het ontwikkelen van het rapport of dashboard met de beschikbare BI\-tool, terwijl je als Data Engineer meer bezig bent met de techniek achter het beschikbaar stellen van de data (en meestal) in de vorm van een datawarehouse.
 



  





**Jouw verantwoordelijkheden** 



* Je analyseert de informatiebehoefte en data;
* Je ontwikkelt rapporten en dashboards;
* Je ontwikkelt een datawarehouse en bijbehorende ETL\-processen;
* Je vertaalt klantvraagstukken naar passende en toekomstbestendige BI\-architectuur;
* Je komt tot resultaten waarmee de opdrachtgever echt blij is;
* Je adviseert over het gebruik van managementinformatie.



  





**Waar wij voor staan** 




 Bij Solviteers werk je samen met een team van deskundige collega's om complexe IT\-vraagstukken aan te pakken. Jouw bijdrage gaat verder dan waarde leveren aan klanten; het draagt direct bij aan positieve maatschappelijke impact. Binnen Solviteers staat professionele groei centraal, maar ook het plezier in samenwerken. Zo kan je naast goed samenwerken met professionals, ook op vrijwillige basis aansluiten bij leuke uitjes die georganiseerd worden door onze personeelsvereniging.
 



  





**Jouw ontwikkeling** 




 Bij Solviteers krijg je de kans om je breed te ontwikkelen en te ontdekken waar jouw kracht ligt. Hoewel je af en toe opdrachten krijgt die minder specifiek gericht zijn op één van onze stromingen binnen het BI\-team, bieden deze juist de mogelijkheid om een veelzijdige professional te worden. Je kunt je nog steeds richten op specialisatie binnen jouw interessegebied, terwijl je jezelf tegelijkertijd blijft uitdagen met nieuwe, diverse opdrachten die jouw professionele groei stimuleren. In ons ervaren BI\-team bouw je expertise op in verschillende rollen, met de ondersteuning van certificeringen en op maat gemaakte groeipaden. Als consultant ben je meer dan alleen een uitvoerder; jouw inbreng speelt een cruciale rol in de richting die we als team inslaan en in de verdere ontwikkeling van onze dienstverlening.
 



  





**Wat breng je mee?** 




 Om succesvol te zijn in deze rol is het belangrijk dat je analytische vaardigheden bezit en creatief bent in het bedenken van oplossingen. Jouw communicatieve vaardigheden en resultaatgerichtheid zorgen er daarnaast voor je dat je nieuwe concepten snel kunt oppakken, goed met stakeholders kan schakelen en flexibel bent in veranderende omstandigheden.
 



  





**Wat je verder meeneemt:** 




  




* Je hebt een hbo\-/wo diploma, bij voorkeur op het gebied van BI of ICT;
* Je hebt ervaring met BI\-tools (Cognos of Power\-BI);
* Je hebt ervaring met SQL (Oracle of SQL\-server);
* Je hebt ervaring met methodieken zoals Scrum en Agile en hebt affiniteit met het inzichtelijk maken van data.



  





**Wat we nog meer graag zouden zien, maar wat je ook bij ons kunt leren:** 




  




* Je hebt bij voorkeur kennis van datawarehouse concepten en architecturen zoals Stermodelleren, Kimball en/of Data Vault;
* Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring met het ontwikkelen van datawarehouses (Oracle of Azure);
* Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring in de (lokale) overheid.



  





**Wat krijg je van ons?** 



* Een vast salaris tussen de €3\.300 en €5\.500
* Winstuitkering en pensioenregeling
* Maatwerk ontwikkelprogramma
* 12 ontwikkeldagen en 12 kennisdelingsdagen met collega’s
* Eigen opleidingsbudget, waarvan een deel vrije keuze om jouw werk\-/privébalans nog beter te maken (gadgets, sportschool of een comfortabele thuiswerkplek)
* Leaseauto of OV\-kaart
* 27 vakantiedagen o.b.v. fulltime
* Hybride werken



  





**Heb je interesse of vragen?** 




 Ik help jou graag verder, je kunt mij bereiken via mail of telefoon.

 Als Junior BI Consultant bij Solviteers krijg je de kans om zowel expertise op te bouwen in Business Intelligence als kennis op te doen van de bronapplicaties binnen de overheidssector. Dit biedt een unieke combinatie die snel veel kennis en ervaring oplevert en een sterke positie in de markt mogelijk maakt. De aanwezigheid van ervaren collega’s stimuleert jouw ontwikkeling, net als de complexiteit en uitdagingen tijdens opdrachten. Dagelijks sta je voor complexe puzzels en geniet je van de variatie en uitdaging die de opdrachten bieden, waardoor je voortdurend wordt uitgedaagd en gemotiveerd.
   

  

 Als Junior BI Consultant analyseer je in eerste instantie de informatiebehoefte van de klant en ontwikkel je rapporten en dashboards. Je kunt je specialiseren in het maken van managementinformatie voor diverse bronapplicaties of nieuwe technieken toepassen. Verder kun je je verdiepen in datawarehousing als BI data engineer, een BI\-architectuur ontwikkelen als data architect of voorspellingsmodellen maken als data scientist. Ten slotte kun je een adviserende rol aannemen om klanten te helpen bij het bepalen van hun managementinformatiebehoeften.
   

  

 Er zijn vijf hoofdrollen binnen BI, hoewel titels kunnen variëren. Vaak overlappen deze rollen, wat betekent dat je tijdens een opdracht elementen van meerdere rollen kunt tegenkomen.
   

  

 In de basis vraag je bij de klant de behoefte naar managementinformatie uit en vertaal je deze naar een rapport of dashboard. Als BI Consultant richt je je op het ontwikkelen van het rapport of dashboard met de beschikbare BI\-tool, terwijl je als Data Engineer meer bezig bent met de techniek achter het beschikbaar stellen van de data (en meestal) in de vorm van een datawarehouse.
   

  

**Waar kom je te werken?**
 Bij Solviteers werk je samen met een team van deskundige collega's om complexe IT\-vraagstukken aan te pakken. Jouw bijdrage gaat verder dan waarde leveren aan klanten; het draagt direct bij aan positieve maatschappelijke impact. Binnen Solviteers staat professionele groei centraal, maar ook het plezier in samenwerken. Zo kan je naast goed samenwerken met professionals, ook op vrijwillige basis aansluiten bij leuke uitjes die georganiseerd worden door onze personeelsvereniging.
   

  

 Bij Solviteers zijn we ervan overtuigd dat je kunt blijven groeien. In onze op maat gemaakte ontwikkeltrajecten focus je op zowel persoonlijke\- als professionele groei. Met specifieke ontwikkelpaden voor elke functie, afgestemd op jouw sterke punten en ambities. Wij bieden trajecten aan waarin je werkt aan het versterken van hard skills, soft skills en praktijkervaring. Bij ons staat jouw groei centraal.
   

  

**Wat wij vragen?**
 Om succesvol te zijn in deze rol is het belangrijk dat je analytische vaardigheden bezit en creatief bent in het bedenken van oplossingen. Jouw communicatieve vaardigheden en resultaatgerichtheid zorgen er daarnaast voor je dat je nieuwe concepten snel kunt oppakken, goed met stakeholders kan schakelen en flexibel bent in veranderende omstandigheden.
   

  

**Wat je verder meeneemt**
* Je hebt een hbo\-/wo diploma, bij voorkeur op het gebied van BI of ICT;
* Je hebt ervaring met BI\-tools (Cognos of Power\-BI);
* Je hebt ervaring met SQL (Oracle of SQL\-server);
* Je hebt ervaring met methodieken zoals Scrum en Agile en hebt affiniteit met het inzichtelijk maken van data.


**Wat we nog meer graag zouden zien, maar wat je ook bij ons kunt leren:**
* Je hebt bij voorkeur kennis van datawarehouse concepten en architecturen zoals Stermodelleren, Kimball en/of Data Vault;
* Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring met het ontwikkelen van datawarehouses (Oracle of Azure);
* Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring in de (lokale) overheid.


**Wat wij bieden?**

* Winstuitkering en pensioenregeling
* Maatwerk ontwikkelprogramma

 You will be based in one of our European offices as part of our Operations Practice.
   

  

 Our Operations Practice assists our clients in solving complex operational challenges. Blending strategic thinking with hands\-on practicality, our teams of consultants and experts work to develop and implement operational strategies that solve our clients’ most pressing problems.
   

  

 McKinsey’s Service Operations service line is part of our Operations Practice. It helps clients create and execute service strategies that lead to competitive advantage, an improved customer experience, higher effectiveness and quality of work, and measurable bottom\-line impact.
   

  

 The service areas we work in range from end\-customer services (e.g., call centers and field services) to internal back\-office operations (e.g., in IT, HR, and Finance). In each of these areas, we help our clients enhance their productivity and set them up for the future, which, in many cases, leads to the longer\-term transformation of the operating model (including structures, processes, technology, and people).
   

  

 When you join McKinsey as a Consultant, you join a firm that will challenge you and invest heavily in your professional development. You will have the opportunity to work in dynamic teams and help leading global organizations solve some of their most challenging and complex problems.
   

  

**Your Impact**
 You will play an active role in problem\-solving for clients, including identifying issues, forming hypotheses, designing and conducting analyses, and synthesizing conclusions into recommendations.
   

  

 You will shape clients’ digital agendas and lead them toward next\-generation operational models—digitally transforming end\-to\-end journeys using advanced analytics, intelligent automation, GenAI, and agile methodologies in service\-oriented industries. Additionally, you will assist our client teams in developing strategies and technology roadmaps for implementing processes and operating systems that support applications connected to digital service operations.
   

  

 As part of your role, you will help clients imagine and implement the future of service delivery—where AI, GenAI, and agentic technologies are reshaping how services are designed, delivered, and scaled.
   

  

 You will work with cross\-functional teams to explore AI\-native operating models, integrate intelligent agents into service ecosystems, and help client’s future\-proof their service strategies by embedding emerging technologies across front\- and back\-office operations.
   

  

 While hands\-on experience in these areas is a plus, what matters most is your ability to think ahead, connect technology to business outcomes, and inspire bold change.
   

  

 You will also gain new skills and build on the strengths you bring to the firm. You will receive exceptional training, frequent coaching, and ongoing mentoring from colleagues and senior leaders on your teams.
   

  

 As part of our two\-year Operations Excellence Program (OEP), you will work on client engagements in the same way as any other McKinsey consultant. You will gain leading edge operations and consultancy skills, primarily through on\-the\-job coaching, which will be complemented by the OEP’s structured capability\-building program.
   

  

 We view the OEP position as the start of a rewarding, challenging and highly flexible career with McKinsey and the Operations practice. During your first few years with the firm, you will serve as a junior practice specialist on multiple client engagements and work with a number of colleagues and clients in a range of industry and operations service lines. You will acquire the necessary knowledge and expertise to help companies achieve excellence in their operations.
   

  

 Along with other members of the OEP community, you will dedicate many days to functional training and knowledge development under the leadership of our operations experts. You will follow a curriculum based on operations excellence themes and will receive advanced training in one of six specific areas of operations manufacturing, product development, purchasing, service operations, supply chain management, or capital excellence.
   

  

 Upon completion of the program, successful consultants will join our global group of leading experts in operational excellence. We already have OEP graduates working at all levels of the firm from associate to partner.
   

  

 Your application should be in English and include your CV and your transcripts (high school, university, etc.), indicating all relevant grades.

 Q42 bouwt digitale producten die het leven van mensen slimmer, beter en leuker maken.
   

  

 Al meer dan 20 jaar helpen we bedrijven als Rijksmuseum, PostNL, HEMA, Avis, AVROTROS en de Efteling met het bedenken en maken van schaalbare producten. Websites, apps, connected devices, AI\-toepassingen en meer. Van idee tot lancering.
   

  

 Tech zit in de kern van alles wat we doen. Onze teams van developers en projectleiders zijn altijd bezig met snel uitproberen, leren en verbeteren. Totdat het product fijn is in gebruik, de business laat groeien én wij er zelf een glimlach van krijgen.
   

  

****Pas jij bij Q42?****
 Ervaring is mooi meegenomen, maar niet het belangrijkste. Jouw technische potentie en de match wegen zwaarder.
   

  

* Zit je in je laatste jaar van een informatica gerelateerde HBO\- of WO\-studie, zoals HBO\-ICT, CMD of Creative Technology en zoek je een plek om een afstudeerstage te doen?
* Experimenteer je 't liefst de hele tijd met nieuwe technologie?
* Hou je van de juiste oplossing bedenken?
* Wil je verschil maken met je werk?
* En leer je graag nieuwe dingen?


 Dan ben jij de stagiair(e) die we zoeken!
   

  

****Past Q42 bij jou?****
 Wil je weten of Q \- zoals we Q42 meestal noemen \- bij jou past? We kunnen je alvast vertellen, wat wij te bieden hebben en waar wij van houden. Dan kun jij inschatten of er voldoende overlap is voor een gesprek.
   

  

* We noemen Q graag een happy place for nerds. We houden dan ook niet zo van kaders. Veel Q'ers doen er iets bij naast het programmeren. Dat houdt Q lekker plat en geeft iedereen de mogelijkheid om mee te sturen én te groeien.
* We houden van techniek. We verdiepen ons graag in dingen als Svelte, Kotlin Multiplatform, .NET en alle nieuwe AI\-tools. Tijdens onze tweewekelijks vrijgeplande dag aka Passietijd leren we het liefst iets nieuws en proberen we dat meteen uit. Maar soms bouwen we ook gewoon even iets geinigs binnen onze comfortzone. Of iets waarvan we vinden dat we dat écht nodig hebben. Zoals een connected glijbaan en connected toiletten.
* Met ruim negentig slimme engineers is er genoeg te leren bij Q. Van Bedenktijdjes en het schrijven voor ons Engineering Blog tot samen leerzame conferenties bezoeken.
* Ons werk is productontwikkeling: het allerbeste product neerzetten om de eindgebruiker te verbazen. Dat doen we met Wie is de Mol?, Efteling, Rijksmuseum, PostNL, gemeente Amsterdam, Philips Hue, HEMA , The National Gallery, Secrid en andere mooie klanten en partners.
* Maar we ontwikkelen ook eígen producten via onze ventures, zoals onze tech for good start\-up Hack The Planet. Die ventures maken ons beter in productdenken, wat we weer kunnen toepassen in onze projecten. En vice versa.
* Techniek is pas interessant met mensen erbij, vinden wij. We testen onze producten dan ook regelmatig met eindgebruikers en maken ons al jaren hard voor accessibility.
* Op onze stekkies in Den Haag en Amsterdam kunnen we fijn in the zone komen én heel goed feesten. Daar houden we sowieso wel van, samen leuke dingen doen: van het jaarlijkse Q\-uitje en onze hackathon tot pubquizzes en bordspelavonden in onze eigen bruine kroeg.
* Wil je nog meer weten, Kom eens langs tijdens een van onze openbare meetups of lees hier ons uitgebreide verhaal!
* Ook relevant: onze arbeidsvoorwaarden. De stagevergoeding bedraagt 600 euro per maand.


****Je ziet voldoende overlap?****
 Laten we dan eens kletsen! Je bent van harte welkom op ons kantoor in Amsterdam of Den Haag. Klik op de button hieronder, dan plannen wij een gesprek in.
   

  

****Stage\-opdrachten****
 (Afstudeer)stages zijn voor Q een manier om onze klanten een cadeautje te geven. Of onszelf natuurlijk. Want stage\-opdrachten leveren vaak nieuwe inzichten en toffe productideeën op.
   

  

 Nu hebben we zelf nog wel een paar voorbeelden van opdrachten. Zie hieronder. Maar we zijn vooral ook retenieuwsgierig naar jouw eigen creativiteit. Dus geef vooral aan als je een véél beter plan hebt waarmee je aan de slag wilt!
   

  

* Een eigen Q\-versie van Github Copilot maken door een open\-source AI\-model te finetunen op code uit onze projecten.
* Image recognition voor het Rijksmuseum.
* Een eigen GPT trainen met open source LLM's om de privacy\- en datazorgen van bedrijven weg te nemen.
* Manieren vinden om de milieu\-impact van een bestaande website of app te evalueren en te verminderen.
* Prepper CMS, Sanity of Q.CMS beter maken voor headless, met als doel om voor een klant een real\-time overzicht van hun inventory te presenteren op een scherm in hun kantoor, bijvoorbeeld door middel van websockets.
* Phoenix is een super scalable batteries included framework met live webview updates dankzij de Elixir programmeertaal. Bij Q doen we tot op heden weinig met deze nieuwe hippe stack. Maar dat kan jij veranderen!


****Onze 'procedure'.****
 ""Een wat? Een procedure?"" Ja, we weten ’t, wij houden er ook niet van. Hebben we gelukkig ook niet zoveel. Maar omdat we stagiair(e)s aannemen best wel heel erg serieus nemen, willen we dit zo goed mogelijk doen. We moeten in dit proces ook kritisch zijn, want we hebben maar ruimte om zo'n vier stagiair(e)s per jaar te begeleiden.
   

  

* Klik op 'Ik wil langskomen!' en maak er een mooi verhaal van.
* We organiseren een kennismakingsgesprek om te kletsen over een stageplek.
* We gaan samen op zoek naar een stage\-opdracht die bij jou en Q42 past. Soms vinden we 'm meteen, soms moeten we er even op broeden.
* We hebben een opdracht dan wel plek gevonden die goed bij je past. Nog een keertje langskomen om te kijken of het klikt bij het team en/of de begeleider waarmee je gaat samenwerken.
* We zetten een krabbel op alle officiële docs, en je komt hier lol en verschil maken.","Technology, Information and Internet",https://nl.linkedin.com/company/q42,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQHizVvJvr3SWw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630579658266/q42_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ioB0C8GJxp5ikQCZdBM6lBXSCTXYZv0kj9BbPPSAC_8,,,,,,,,,,,,llm,linkedin,nl

 Dit ga je doen
   

  

 Als AI Engineer bij Fellowmind ben je voornamelijk bezig met het ontwerpen, bouwen en doorontwikkelen van AI\-oplossingen voor onze klanten. Je werkt nauw samen met de andere Business Lines binnen Fellowmind waarbij je opereert op het snijvlak van AI en innovatie; als zij er niet meer uitkomen ben jij degene die ze raadplegen. Je hebt dan ook ervaring met het toepassen van 'best practices' en bent niet bang om nieuwe AI\-technologiën en –innovaties te verkennen.
   

  

 Met jouw scherpe vragen achterhaal je niet alleen de behoefte van onze klanten, maar jij vertaalt deze ook naar een passende, veilige en verantwoorde oplossing. Hierbij ben je een waardevolle bron van kennis en expertise voor je collega's. Op het gebied van AI help je hen de vertaalslag te maken van theorie naar praktijk. Het leuke hieraan is dat wij opereren in veel verschillende focusmarkten, waaronder manufacturing, finance en healthcare.
   

  

 Je zult deel uitmaken van de nieuwe Business Line AI, een Business Line die is gespecialiseerd in het ontwikkelen van low\- en pro\-code AI\-toepassingen op het Microsoft platform. Op dit moment zijn dat vooral Gen. AI agents, maar we zijn ook een propositie aan het ontwikkelen rond Machine Learning.
   

  

**Een dag als AI Engineer**
 De werkdag begint! Je start rustig op en om 09\.00 uur is het tijd voor de dagstart samen met jouw collega’s en de klant. Samen bespreek je hoe de dag eruitziet en welke acties eventueel extra aandacht vereisen of waar je hulp bij nodig hebt. Je hebt vandaag een afwisselende dag. In de ochtend heb je tijd om gefocust aan de slag te gaan met het ontwerpen en bouwen van een nieuwe AI\-oplossing voor een klant in de finance sector. Je gaat vandaag aan de slag met Python en Autogen om een multi\-agent systeem te ontwikkelen waarmee de klant beter inzicht krijgt in de financiële data. Als laatste test je nog in Promptflow of alles werkt zodat.
   

  

 Na een productieve ochtend is het tijd voor de lunch. Dit is een perfect moment om een lekkere wandeling te maken, een potje pingpong te spelen of in onze Social Clubroom samen met je collega’s te eten.
   

  

 In de middag heb je een meeting gepland staan met een klant uit de healthcare sector. Samen met je collega’s (in dit geval een Technology Specialist, een aantal Functioneel Consultants en een BI Consultant) en de klant bespreek je de specifieke behoeften en uitdagingen waar zij mee te maken hebben. Met jouw scherpe vragen achterhaal je de kern van hun probleem en begin je met het vertalen van deze behoeften naar een passende AI\-oplossing.
   

  

 Later op de dag werk je aan de doorontwikkeling van een bestaande AI\-agent die wordt gebruikt door een klant in de manufacturing sector. Je implementeert nieuwe functionaliteiten via een MCP server die de prestaties van de agent optimaliseren. Hierbij ben je niet bang om nieuwe technologieën te verkennen en toe te passen.
   

  

 Om de dag af te ronden, bereid je je voor op de AI ontwikkeling dag die de volgende dag plaats gaat vinden. Op deze dag ga je met je collega’s Max (AI Business Line Expert) en Reuben (AI engineer) kijken welke producten en services jullie nog meer kunnen gaan ontwikkelen om onze klanten nog beter van dienst te kunnen zijn.

 Bij Cardan zetten we ons dagelijks in voor een inclusieve digitale samenleving waarin iedereen – met of zonder beperking – volwaardig mee kan doen. Dat doen we met een team van betrokken professionals die toegankelijkheid niet alleen als wettelijke verplichting zien, maar vooral als maatschappelijke verantwoordelijkheid.
 



  





 We zijn toegankelijk, betrouwbaar, behulpzaam, innovatief en gepassioneerd. Die waarden zie je terug in onze aanpak én in de technologieën die we ontwikkelen. Zo hebben we onze eigen SaaS\-oplossing ontwikkeld. Deze krachtige tool ondersteunt organisaties bij het structureel verbeteren van digitale toegankelijkheid. Omdat de tool in elke audit enorme hoeveelheden relevante data genereert, vormt het ook een ideale basis voor het toepassen van AI\-oplossingen. Denk aan automatische rapportages, slimme analyses van auditbevindingen of gepersonaliseerde adviezen op basis van wet\- en regelgeving zoals de WCAG.
 



  





 AI is voor ons geen doel op zich, maar een strategisch middel om onze missie kracht bij te zetten: het versnellen van processen, het verhogen van kwaliteit en het vergroten van impact. Door slim gebruik te maken van data en technologie maken we onze dienstverlening niet alleen schaalbaar, maar ook toekomstbestendig.
 



  





 Het bewustzijn rond digitale toegankelijkheid groeit – mede door nieuwe wetgeving – maar dat is nog maar het begin. Daarom groeien we als organisatie hard en willen we onze impact verder vergroten, in Nederland én daarbuiten. Met jou zorgen we ervoor dat digitale producten toegankelijk worden voor iedereen. Zoals Artikel 1 van de Wet gelijke behandeling op grond van handicap of chronische ziekte stelt: “Ieder mens moet in staat worden gesteld aansluitend bij zijn eigen mogelijkheden autonoom te zijn.”

**Worden we blij van****
 Je bent een Developer die graag verantwoordelijkheid neemt voor eigen projecten en een sterke affiniteit heeft met technologie, digitalisering, robotisering en AI. Jij blijft jezelf continu ontwikkelen in deze domeinen. Qua development skills werken we het meest met fit for purpose development. Dit betekend ook vaak nieuwe talen en technieken (veilig)(leren) gebruiken. Laatste jaren gebruiken we een mix van python, SaaS (vnml Azure) en low code voor onze onderzoeken en implementaties. Voor GenAI hebben we toegang tot de nieuwste OpenAI modellen via Azure. We verwachten dus wel dat je wendbaar bent en dat jij je development skills toe kan passen binnen een breed scala aan (nieuwe) technologieën.

**Een goed team
   

  

**Daar hoor je bij****
 Meteen vanaf dag één maak je onderdeel uit van het net opgerichte R\&D team. Dat is één van de drie kleine teams binnen de Digitale Innovatie \& AI Agile Release Train. Samen met onze collega’s van het GenAI en Digitale Innovatie team zijn we een klein team dat opereert als een startup binnen een groot bedrijf. Binnen een afdeling van 13 enthousiaste en gedreven “ondernemers” zijn we op zoek naar het toevoegen van waarde d.m.v. Digitale Innovatie \& AI. Het team is in staat om snel nieuwe ideeën te onderzoeken of om te zetten in realiteit binnen de complexe context van de netbeheerder.
   

  

 Ons team werkt met probleemgericht innoveren, lean startup en/of technology pushes en zorgt daarmee dat Stedin sneller en efficiënter kan werken; een ontzettend belangrijke rol in het versnellen van de energietransitie! Ondanks dat we met 3 teams samen in onze ART opereren en ieder zijn of haar eigen specialisme heeft, hebben we veel contact met elkaar. Bijvoorbeeld als we allemaal samen zitten op onze 2 vaste kantoordagen, om te sparren over de beste oplossingsrichting, om te leren van elkaars ervaringen, tijdens de teamuitjes of met een lekkere kop koffie bij de koffiebar op ons dakterras. We zijn goed op elkaar ingespeeld, ieders bijdrage wordt gewaardeerd en, niet onbelangrijk, elke dag moet er gelachen worden!
   

  

*""Dit team is dé plek waar je de nieuwste digitale technologieën kan toepassen om de energietransitie te versnellen! Doordat je heel vrij bent om te bepalen welke oplossing jij denkt dat de juiste is voor een bepaald project, en door het gevoel van saamhorigheid binnen het team, hangt er een unieke en inspirerende sfeer."" – Boran Apak, AI Developer*
*“Met onze unieke plek binnen het bedrijf kunnen wij technologie oppakken waar wij enthousiast van worden en waarde in zien; Als ik iets nieuws tegenkom probeer ik het vaak ook direct uit. Die ruimte om buiten de gebaande paden te denken en het ook te implementeren als het goed werkt is op niet veel plekken te vinden.” Marnix de Graaf, Lead R\&D* 
 .
   

  

**Mooie arbeidsvoorwaarden
   

  

**Die wil je hebben****
 Dat je van ons je eigen telefoon (of een Bring Your Own Device vergoeding) en laptop krijgt, vinden we nogal vanzelfsprekend. Wat mag je nog meer van Stedin als werkgever verwachten?
   

  

 Alle financiële arbeidsvoorwaarden op een rij, weet je meteen waar je aan toe bent:
   

  

* Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden horen erbij. Zo krijg je een (maximaal) salaris van € 5\.700 gebaseerd op 40 uur per week en kennis en ervaring, 24,5 vakantiedagen en bouw je prima pensioen op bij het ABP.
* Boven op je salaris ontvang je een persoonlijk budget van 24% (inclusief 8% vakantiegeld). Jij kiest elke maand wat je met het budget doet. Elke maand extra salaris? (Zo kun je ook € 6\.612 per maand inclusief 16% Persoonlijk Budget verdienen) Of meer verlofdagen? In  onze nieuwe Rekentool  krijg je alvast een voorproefje van hoe jouw persoonlijk budget eruit zou kunnen zien en hoe je het zou kunnen besteden.
* Gezonde energie die heb je nodig. Daarom krijg je van ons ook een Duurzaam Inzetbaarheid budget van €500 bruto per jaar (bijvoorbeeld voor je sportabonnement, een hometrainer of je nieuwe sport outfit).
* Volgens ons Stedin@Work concept werk je 50% thuis en 50% op kantoor, wel zo flexibel. Wij zorgen voor jouw thuiswerkfaciliteiten, een thuiswerkvergoeding en reizen naar kantoor doe je met je OV vrij\-abonnement waarmee je ook buiten werk onbeperkt kan reizen!

Een goed team
  
Daar hoor je bij
  
  

Meteen vanaf dag één maak je onderdeel uit van het net opgerichte R\&D team. Dat is één van de drie kleine teams binnen de Digitale Innovatie \& AI Agile Release Train. Samen met onze collega’s van het GenAI en Digitale Innovatie team zijn we een klein team dat opereert als een startup binnen een groot bedrijf. Binnen een afdeling van 13 enthousiaste en gedreven “ondernemers” zijn we op zoek naar het toevoegen van waarde d.m.v. Digitale Innovatie \& AI. Het team is in staat om snel nieuwe ideeën te onderzoeken of om te zetten in realiteit binnen de complexe context van de netbeheerder.
  
  

Ons team werkt met probleemgericht innoveren, lean startup en/of technology pushes en zorgt daarmee dat Stedin sneller en efficiënter kan werken; een ontzettend belangrijke rol in het versnellen van de energietransitie! Ondanks dat we met 3 teams samen in onze ART opereren en ieder zijn of haar eigen specialisme heeft, hebben we veel contact met elkaar. Bijvoorbeeld als we allemaal samen zitten op onze 2 vaste kantoordagen, om te sparren over de beste oplossingsrichting, om te leren van elkaars ervaringen, tijdens de teamuitjes of met een lekkere kop koffie bij de koffiebar op ons dakterras. We zijn goed op elkaar ingespeeld, ieders bijdrage wordt gewaardeerd en, niet onbelangrijk, elke dag moet er gelachen worden!
  
  

""Dit team is dé plek waar je de nieuwste digitale technologieën kan toepassen om de energietransitie te versnellen! Doordat je heel vrij bent om te bepalen welke oplossing jij denkt dat de juiste is voor een bepaald project, en door het gevoel van saamhorigheid binnen het team, hangt er een unieke en inspirerende sfeer."" – Boran Apak, AI Developer
  
  

“Met onze unieke plek binnen het bedrijf kunnen wij technologie oppakken waar wij enthousiast van worden en waarde in zien; Als ik iets nieuws tegenkom probeer ik het vaak ook direct uit. Die ruimte om buiten de gebaande paden te denken en het ook te implementeren als het goed werkt is op niet veel plekken te vinden.” Marnix de Graaf, Lead R\&D.

### **Dit ga je doen**


Als Business Consultant AI bij Fellowmind ben jij de drijvende kracht achter innovatie. Je bent het vertrouwde aanspreekpunt voor klanten en voorziet hen van strategisch advies. Je schakelt soepel tussen klanten en collega’s, waarbij je jouw expertise inzet om processen, kansen en knelpunten om te zetten naar waardevolle AI\-oplossingen. Stakeholdermanagement is belangrijk waarbij je echt een regierol hebt en weet welke expertise je wanneer moet aanhaken.


Je hebt een voorliefde voor processen. Of je nu workshops faciliteert om de meest waardevolle use cases te identificeren, of samen met je collega’s werkt aan een innovatieve AI\-oplossing, jij speelt een sleutelrol in elke fase van het proces. De AI\-oplossingen moeten aansluiten bij de eindgebruikers en geen extra belasting vormen. Als Business Consultant AI aan tafel met de klant, zorg je dat de Engineers en de klant dezelfde taal spreken en durf je door te vragen.


Je maakt deel uit van de Business Line AI, waar ontwikkeling en samenwerking centraal staan. Gen. AI agents vormen de kern van ons werk, maar we breiden onze focus uit met interessant propositie\-ontwikkeling rondom Machine Learning. Met een sterke aanwezigheid in sectoren zoals manufacturing, finance en healthcare, biedt deze rol volop kansen om bij te dragen aan toekomstgerichte projecten.

**Zo ziet je werkdag eruit als Business Consultant AI**


Je start je ochtend op locatie bij een klant in de maakindustrie. Samen met deze klant en je F\&O consultants ga je aan de slag om de usercases te identificeren. Met deze output ga je morgen verder omdat er nog meer op de planning staat vandaag.


Zodra je weer op kantoor bent, start de meeting over een pilot waar wat uitdagingen lopen. Je communicatieve skills zijn hierin erg belangrijk zodat je deze uitdaging zo goed mogelijk kan oplossen en alle neuzen dezelfde kant weer uit krijgt.


In de middag is het tijd voor de lunch waar je in de Social Clubroom met je collega’s een boterham kunt gaan eten, een lekkere wandeling kan gaan maken of uitgedaagd wordt voor een potje tafelvoetbal.


Na de lunch ga je verder met de voorbereidingen voor een demo bij de klant. Dit wordt een hele interessant inspiratiesessie waarbij je de nieuwste technologieën op het gebied van AI laat zien aan deze klant. Om bij te blijven bij die nieuwste technologieën, heb je aan het einde van de dag nog een uurtje tijd om het laatste nieuws bij te lezen en de mooie dingen eruit te halen.


En morgen? Morgen is weer een nieuwe dag, vol mooie AI oplossingen, gesprekken bij andere klante en ontmoetingen met collega’s. De dag zal er weer anders uitzien, en vooral dat maakt deze rol zo leuk!

### **Dit ga je doen**


Als AI Engineer bij Fellowmind ben je voornamelijk bezig met het ontwerpen, bouwen en doorontwikkelen van AI\-oplossingen voor onze klanten. Je werkt nauw samen met de andere Business Lines binnen Fellowmind waarbij je opereert op het snijvlak van AI en innovatie; als zij er niet meer uitkomen ben jij degene die ze raadplegen. Je hebt dan ook ervaring met het toepassen van 'best practices' en bent niet bang om nieuwe AI\-technologiën en –innovaties te verkennen.


Met jouw scherpe vragen achterhaal je niet alleen de behoefte van onze klanten, maar jij vertaalt deze ook naar een passende, veilige en verantwoorde oplossing. Hierbij ben je een waardevolle bron van kennis en expertise voor je collega's. Op het gebied van AI help je hen de vertaalslag te maken van theorie naar praktijk. Het leuke hieraan is dat wij opereren in veel verschillende focusmarkten, waaronder manufacturing, finance en healthcare.


Je zult deel uitmaken van de nieuwe Business Line AI, een Business Line die is gespecialiseerd in het ontwikkelen van low\- en pro\-code AI\-toepassingen op het Microsoft platform. Op dit moment zijn dat vooral Gen. AI agents, maar we zijn ook een propositie aan het ontwikkelen rond Machine Learning.


**Een dag als AI Engineer**  

De werkdag begint! Je start rustig op en om 09\.00 uur is het tijd voor de dagstart samen met jouw collega’s en de klant. Samen bespreek je hoe de dag eruitziet en welke acties eventueel extra aandacht vereisen of waar je hulp bij nodig hebt. Je hebt vandaag een afwisselende dag. In de ochtend heb je tijd om gefocust aan de slag te gaan met het ontwerpen en bouwen van een nieuwe AI\-oplossing voor een klant in de finance sector. Je gaat vandaag aan de slag met Python en Autogen om een multi\-agent systeem te ontwikkelen waarmee de klant beter inzicht krijgt in de financiële data. Als laatste test je nog in Promptflow of alles werkt zodat.


Na een productieve ochtend is het tijd voor de lunch. Dit is een perfect moment om een lekkere wandeling te maken, een potje pingpong te spelen of in onze Social Clubroom samen met je collega’s te eten.


In de middag heb je een meeting gepland staan met een klant uit de healthcare sector. Samen met je collega’s (in dit geval een Technology Specialist, een aantal Functioneel Consultants en een BI Consultant) en de klant bespreek je de specifieke behoeften en uitdagingen waar zij mee te maken hebben. Met jouw scherpe vragen achterhaal je de kern van hun probleem en begin je met het vertalen van deze behoeften naar een passende AI\-oplossing.


Later op de dag werk je aan de doorontwikkeling van een bestaande AI\-agent die wordt gebruikt door een klant in de manufacturing sector. Je implementeert nieuwe functionaliteiten via een MCP server die de prestaties van de agent optimaliseren. Hierbij ben je niet bang om nieuwe technologieën te verkennen en toe te passen.

Als Business Consultant Innovatie word je verantwoordelijk voor het realiseren van de innovatie\- en digitale ambities van Stater in de tribe Origination!

  

#### **Over Stater**


**Wie zijn wij?**
=================


Wie is Stater eigenlijk? Wellicht heb je nog nooit van ons gehoord, dus wij leggen je graag uit wat we doen. Binnen stater ontwikkelen en leveren wij hypothecaire diensten en platformen voor externe geldgevers. Met onze producten en diensten beheren wij 40% van de hypotheken in Nederland. Werken bij ons is dus werken bij een organisatie die midden in de maatschappij staat met producten die veel Nederlandse gezinnen (in) raken. Onze klanten zijn o.a. grote Nederlandse banken en andere geldverstrekkers.


#### **Over deze functie**


**Wat ga je doen?**
===================


Zoals je weet zijn wij de grootse hypothecaire dienstverlener van Nederland! Dat willen wij uiteraard blijven en ook onze positie internationaal gaan uitbreiden en versterken. Daarom ben jij als Business Consultant Innovatie onder andere verantwoordelijk voor het vernieuwen van onze innovatieve dienstverlening aan de hand van (internationale) marktontwikkelingen, data en gesprekken met jouw stakeholders. Deze ontwikkelingen vertaal jij naar nieuwe producten en diensten voor het ‘mortgage origination’ domein.

  



Wat houdt dat nou precies in? Op dit moment zijn we druk met verschillende digitaliseringsprojecten als instant hypotheekacceptatie, toepassen van externe bronnen, maar ook projecten die zich richten op verdere integratie in de hypotheekketen en internationalisering van het platform. We zijn continue bezig met het verder verbeteren en vernieuwen van de dienstverlening in het Origination domein. Deze innovatie trajecten hebben invloed bij intermediairs, consumenten en natuurlijk onze klanten.

  



Dit doe je niet alleen, je werkt nauw samen met onze klanten, partners en interne kennishouders welke verspreid zijn over verschillende afdelingen binnen Stater. Zo weet je dat geen dag hetzelfde is!

  



Een collega aan het woord: “Hoe kunnen we consumenten en adviseurs zo snel mogelijk duidelijkheid geven over een hypotheekaanvraag? Welke data is er nodig voor de acceptatie van een hypotheek? Wat zijn de overeenkomsten en verschillen in de hypotheek journeys in Nederland, België en Duitsland? Dat zijn onder andere de vragen waar wij dagelijks mee bezig zijn. Samen met collega's in de landen waar Stater actief is, maar ook samen met onze klanten, werken we aan nieuwe proposities en het continue verbeteren van onze bestaande dienstverlening. Denk aan het automatisch ophalen van gegevens via externe bronnen, zodat consumenten en adviseurs geen documenten meer hoeven aan te leveren voor een hypotheekaanvraag. Mijn inspiratie haal ik vooral uit mijn verbinding met de gebruikers binnen het hypotheekproces, maar ook uit onze data en ontwikkelingen uit andere sectoren. Zo kunnen wij blijven innoveren, voor nieuwe én bestaande producten en diensten.”

  

#### **Skills**


**Naar wie zijn wij op zoek?**
==============================


Je bent van nature overtuigend en energiek en staat stevig in je schoenen. Of je nu bij e collega’s of bij klanten of business partners aan tafel zit, jij kunt en durft strategisch organisatieadvies te geven. Daarbij kun je ook wel tegen een beetje weerstand. Doelen en prioriteiten stellen gaat je niet alleen goed af, je kunt ook aan anderen uitleggen wat er moet gebeuren en waarom. Met jouw doorzettingsvermogen en vastberadenheid weet je ook anderen te motiveren tot verandering. Verder heb je:


* Minimaal hbo werk\- en denkniveau (met bijv. een Bedrijfskunde achtergrond).
* Minimaal 3 jaar aantoonbare ervaring in B2B consultancy.
* Ervaring in een commerciële omgeving.
* Ervaring in een innovatieve omgeving waar je van niets iets moest creëren.
* Bekend met IT\-technologieën, je hoeft geen IT’er te zijn.
* Affiniteit met de hypotheekmarkt, producten en processen, bij voorkeur het mid\-office domein.
* Affiniteit met digitale klantbediening.
**Wat bieden we je aan?**
=========================


Het begint natuurlijk bij een uitdagende functie en een werkomgeving waar jij je thuis voelt, maar ook de overige arbeidsvoorwaarden zijn belangrijk. Hier een aantal van onze arbeidsvoorwaarden op een rijtje:


* Een organisatie waar jij centraal staat met maximale aandacht voor jouw ontwikkeling. Ons Stater Learning Center biedt je op onze kosten de ruimte om sterker te worden op persoonlijk en inhoudelijk vlak. Interne doorgroei stimuleren en faciliteren wij.
* Ons salaris is opgebouwd uit twee componenten. Naast een bruto maandsalaris van €5\.222,\- en €6\.528,\- (schaal 22\), bieden wij een flexibel inzetbaar budget. Waar zet jij dit budget voor in? Geniet je van extra vakantiedagen, laat je dit liever uitbetalen of kies je een andere optie?
* NS Business card of een reiskostenvergoeding.
* Hybride werken is bij ons heel normaal. Om dat te faciliteren bieden wij je een goede thuiswerkvergoeding en een thuiswerkplek.
* Profiteer van onze aantrekkelijke collectiviteitskortingen op bijvoorbeeld je zorgverzekering en woonverzekeringen – extra zekerheid met een mooie korting!
* Een goede pensioenregeling, wij vinden het belangrijk dat je later ook nog profijt hebt van je inzet bij ons.

Bij Inpact helpen we verzekeraars innoveren, zodat zij tijd en focus overhouden voor het échte werk. Als AI/ML Engineer bouw je mee aan de toekomst van verzekeren. Zonder poespas, mét resultaat. Ja, we zijn ambitieus. Maar hier geen overmatig werken of competitie over functietitels. Grote ego's laten we buiten, grootse plannen verwelkomen we met open armen. Daarom nemen we ook aan op ambitie, in plaats van op ervaring. Ons team bestaat uit een hechte club van 100 nuchtere collega's (waarvan zeker 70 tech\-specialisten) met een passie voor technologie, AI en Data Science. We doen niet aan gedoe, we doen vooral heel normaal terwijl we complexe data omzetten naar waardevolle inzichten voor verzekeraars.

**Zo bouw jij mee aan de toekomst van verzekeren**

We hebben het al genoemd: wij zoeken mensen die gewoon goed werk doen. Geen poespas, wél baanbrekend werk. Geen opschepperij, wél trots op wat we samen bereiken. En als AI/ML Engineer verwachten we dat je:

* Een relevante wo\-opleiding hebt in Data Science, Informatica, Wiskunde, Kunstmatige Intelligentie of Econometrie.
* Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring hebt met frameworks en tools voor machine learning en deep learning, zoals PyTorch en Sklearn.
* Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring hebt met Large Language Models(LLM), waaronder fine\-tuning, prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\-systemen.
* Ervaring met het ontwikkelen en implementeren van machine learning\-oplossingen met grootschalige datasets, inclusief specificatieontwerp, dataverzameling en \-labeling, modelontwikkeling, validatie, implementatie en voortdurende monitoring.
* Ervaring hebt met Python, C\# of Java en source control (Git).
* Een pré als je ervaring hebt met cloudplatforms (bijv. AWS, Azure, GCP).
* Ervaring met data engineering pipelines.
* Proactief, analytisch en samenwerkingsgericht bent.

**Dit vinden wij de normaalste zaak van de wereld**

In één jaar van 10 naar 100 klanten groeien? Dat vinden wij niet gek. Een starter die binnen no\-time haar eigen team aanstuurt? Kan gewoon. En de koffie? Gewoon een kop normale koffie, ténzij je het anders wilt natuurlijk. Wat we nog meer normaal vinden?

* Een competitief salaris
* Prima pensioenregeling waarmee je oude dag gewoon goed geregeld is
* Nieuwe hardware zoals een Lenovo laptop, BOSE headset en veel AI tools
* Gewoon vanuit huis kunnen werken, met een onbelaste thuiswerkvergoeding van €2,35 per dag
* 25 verlofdagen op basis van een 40\-urige werkweek
* Een persoonlijk budget en ontwikkelplan om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen via o.a. Udemy Business
* Volop kansen om te groeien, zonder politiek geneuzel
* Gewoon op tijd naar huis voor het avondeten
* Je functie vormen naar je eigen ambities
* Gratis parkeren voor de deur
* Regelmatige gezellige uitjes, lunches, borrels, LAN\-party's en spelletjesavonden

**Ook gewoon goed werk doen?**

We kunnen jouw nuchtere instelling goed gebruiken om samen de beste insurtech van Nederland te worden. Klik op de solliciteerknop of stuur je sollicitatie naar gijs@inpact.recruitee.com.

Tijdens het sollicitatieproces houden we het graag simpel. We laten je vaak binnen twee werkdagen weten wat we van je sollicitatie vinden. Is er een match? Dan maken we kennis via Google Meet. Daarna volgen nog twee gesprekken bij ons op locatie.

gd-1009703819752,glassdoor,https://www.glassdoor.nl/job-listing/j?jl=1009703819752,,Machine learning engineer,Incentro,Nederland,2025-04-10,,direct_data,monthly,4000.0,5500.0,EUR,False,,,organic,,"**Van GenAI\-chatbots tot slimme modellen: hier maak jij het verschil met data.**  
Bij Van Ommen bouwden we een AI\-chatbot die klanten sneller naar het juiste product leidt én de klantenservice ontlast. Voor Simon Loos ontwikkelden we een oplossing die ritdata slim clustert – met directe kostenbesparing als resultaat. En bij PostNL zorgen onze modellen ervoor dat klantmails automatisch én klantvriendelijk worden afgehandeld.

Als Machine Learning Engineer bij Incentro werk je aan dit soort betekenisvolle oplossingen én aan innovatieve projecten zoals agentic AI oplossingen. Je krijgt het vertrouwen om je eigen keuzes te maken en jouw expertise zichtbaar in te zetten. Alles draait hier om autonomie, groei en echte samenwerking. Geen opgelegd pad, maar vrijheid in hoe je je werk doet.

**Wat je gaat doen**  
Samen met een betrokken team van data experts werk jij aan AI\-oplossingen die ertoe doen. Projecten waarin je vakmanschap zichtbaar wordt, en waarin jouw bijdrage het verschil maakt.

Wat je concreet doet:

* je ontwikkelt en traint machine learning\-modellen in Python, met behulp van TensorFlow, PyTorch en scikit\-learn, waarbij je nauwkeurig werkt aan prestaties, explainability en betrouwbaarheid
* je analyseert complexe datasets met Pandas en Numpy, en ontdekt patronen die leiden tot verrassende inzichten voor klanten
* je zorgt dat alles naar productie gaat via CI/CD, versiebeheer in Git, en containerisatie met Docker – jij houdt grip op kwaliteit
* je bouwt en integreert modellen in de cloud (denk aan Vertex AI, SageMaker, of Azure ML) en denkt actief mee over schaalbaarheid en betrouwbaarheid
* je past Generative AI toe via API’s van bijv. OpenAI of Anthropic, en weet hoe je met vector search en RAG slimme, persoonlijke oplossingen bouwt.
* Je experimenteert met agentic AI\-frameworks zoals LangChain, waarmee je systemen bouwt die zelfstandig kunnen redeneren en uitvoeren

**De impact die je maakt**  
Jouw werk heeft direct effect. Niet alleen op systemen, maar ook op mensen. Je helpt organisaties slimmer, sneller of klantgerichter te werken. En dat voel je – in de waardering van de klant, de erkenning van je team en de trots op je werk.

Voorbeelden?

* **Bij Van Ommen** ontwikkelen we een GenAI\-chatbot die klanten écht helpt zoeken. Het beoogde resultaat? Hogere conversie, minder vragen aan support en een soepelere klantreis.
* **Bij PostNL** automatiseerden we de afhandeling van klantmails met ML. Dat bespaart tijd, verhoogt de kwaliteit van reacties én maakt medewerkers blijer.
* **Bij Simon Loos** brachten we structuur aan in ritdata via clustering. Daardoor weten ze nu precies wat er gefactureerd moet worden – met directe besparingen als gevolg.
* **Voor PostNL marketing** bouwden we een model voor klantsegmentatie. Zo zetten ze campagnes gerichter in, met meer resultaat en minder verspilling.

**Wie ben jij?**  
Jij bent iemand die wil groeien in je vak én iets betekenen met je werk. Je zoekt een plek waar jouw ideeën welkom zijn, waar je autonomie krijgt en waar je wordt uitgedaagd om verder te denken dan het model alleen.

Wat jij meebrengt:

* Minimaal 3 jaar ervaring met Python en cloudplatforms als GCP, AWS of Azure
* Kennis van ML\-libraries zoals TensorFlow, PyTorch en sklearn
* Vertrouwd met Docker, Git, CI/CD en het bouwen van ETL\-pipelines
* Interesse in (of ervaring met) Generative AI, RAGs, LLM’s en vector search
* Je communiceert helder – in het Nederlands én in het Engels

Daarnaast herken je je in onze CBAM\-waarden:

* **Camaraderie** – We zijn meer dan collega’s: we inspireren, ondersteunen en vieren successen samen.
* **Boldness** – We durven te experimenteren én kritisch mee te denken voor echte impact.
* **Autonomy** – Jij krijgt het vertrouwen en de ruimte om je werk zelf vorm te geven.
* **Mastery** – We blijven leren en groeien, met een persoonlijk ontwikkelpad en volop kennisdeling.

*Twijfel je of je helemaal past? We leren je graag kennen – ook als je niet aan elk vinkje voldoet.*

**We bieden jou** 

* een vast contract bij de start
* de mogelijkheid om 32u tot 40u per week te werken
* een salaris tussen de €4\.000,\- \& €5\.500,\- \+ 8% vakantiegeld
* een onbeperkt opleidingsbudget, zónder studieschuld
* een elektrische leaseauto naar keuze of een extra €520,\- bruto én km\-vergoeding
* een NS\-Business Card voor je zakelijke reizen (én prive reizen, indien je geen gebruik maakt van een leaseauto)
* 27 vakantiedagen, 10 bij te kopen, vrije invulling religieuze vakantiedagen
* een premievrij\-pensioen
* elke 4 jaar €2700,\- budget to pick\-your\-own laptop \& gear
* de mogelijkheid om aandeelhouder worden (en zo samen met 150\+ andere collega's mede\-eigenaar te zijn van Incentro)
* mastery money: een jaarlijkse uitkering van €650 om jouw potentieel te ontketenen. Jij kiest wat jou helpt om het beste uit jezelf te halen: een cursus Spaans, een vakantie of nieuwe hardloopschoenen. It’s up to you!
* maandelijkse onkosten\- \& sportvergoeding en een tegemoetkoming voor het inrichten van je thuiswerkplek
* een team waar serieuze aandacht is voor diversiteit \& inclusiviteit en waar je ondersteunt wordt bij zowel fysieke als mentale gezondheid

Incentro biedt daarnaast nog veel meer. Samen organiseren we de nodige borrels, feestjes of meerdaagse ‘even met elkaar weg’... Elk jaar gaan we samen op **Wincentrosport** en zien we collega’s gezamenlijk workations organiseren.

Bij ons leer je in de praktijk, aan echte machines, voor echte klanten in de farmaceutische\- en maakindustrie.

Het Linux team beheert een aantal HPC’s en het configureren en beheren van deze geavanceerde High\-performance computing clusters valt ook tot een van de taken.  

  

Je bent een member van een team in een uiterst professionele, innovatieve werkomgeving, met internationale topexperts als collega’s. Als Linux Engineer ben je natuurlijk ook bezig met het beheren, bewaken en onderhouden van complexe en gevirtualiseerde IT\-Infrastructuren. Je zal ook meer ervaring op doen met verschillende Linux distros zoals RedHat Core \& Enterprise, Debian, OpenSUSE/SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Ubuntu, etc. En zal werken met Docker, Kubernetes, GPU\-accelerated computing en RH Openshift. Hierbij is het zaak dat zoveel mogelijk problemen worden voorkomen.  

  

Je onderhoudt de systemen accuraat en volgens vastgestelde TNO\-procedures en ISO\-normen.
**Wat wij van jou verwachten**
------------------------------


Als Linux Engineer sta je veel in contact met de business en heb je een cruciale rol als het gaat om optimalisatie en onderhoud van de Linux omgeving.  

  

Om deze rol goed uit te kunnen voeren is het van belang dat je jezelf herkent in het volgende profiel:
* Je hebt ervaring met Linux in een enterprise omgeving.
* Je hebt echt een passie voor Linux. Voor jou is er geen andere optie dan dat Linux hét standaard besturingssysteem zou moeten zijn. Je kunt wel leven met het feit dat dit bij TNO (nog) niet het geval is.
* Je hebt een passie voor het configureren en beheren van soft/hardware, maar weet ook dat het documenteren ervan belangrijk is.
* TNO is tweetalig dus een goede beheersing van de Nederlandse en Engelse taal is een must.
* Je bent een team\-player en plays nice with others.
* Dat je onze security screening en die van de AIVD en MIVD overleeft.
**Wat wij jou bieden**
----------------------


Uitdagend én afwisselend werk met serieuze impact. En volop kansen, want bij TNO heb je grotendeels zelf de regie over je carrière. Naast een bruto (fulltime) maandsalaris tussen € 3\.964,\- en € 5\.225,\- (afhankelijk van je kennis en ervaring), vakantiegeld (8%), een dertiende maand (8,33%) en een flexbudget (5,58% \+ €180\), krijg je alle mogelijkheden om jezelf te ontwikkelen.  

  

Daarnaast kun je bij TNO een ‘menu’ aan arbeidsvoorwaarden samenstellen dat bij jouw persoonlijke situatie past. Wat je ook mag verwachten:
* Een uiterst professionele, innovatieve werkomgeving, met topexperts als collega’s.
* Mogelijkheid om cursussen, opleidingen en workshops te volgen en congressen te bezoeken, en coaching als je daar behoefte aan hebt.
* 33 vakantiedagen (bij een fulltime dienstverband).
* Een uitgebreide en flexibele mobiliteitsregeling, inclusief volledige vergoeding van openbaar vervoer voor woon\-werk en zakelijke reizen.
* Gezellige activiteiten met je team en andere TNO'ers. Zo leer je snel veel mensen kennen.
* Flexibele werktijden, de mogelijkheid om parttime (32 of 36 uur) te werken en de mogelijkheid om thuis te werken.

Dit ga je doen
  
  

Door de energietransitie neemt ons werk ontzettend toe. Daarom zijn we ons werk aan het verslimmen met behulp van AI, zodat we samen werk kunnen maken van een leefwereld vol nieuwe energie. Dit is een mooie taak voor onze nieuwe Large Language Model (LLM) Ddeveloper collega. Als LLM Developer werk je in het functieteam Generative AI in het Digitale Innovatie \& AI team van Stedin. Het Generative AI team is speciaal opgericht om met volle focus de kansen en mogelijkheden van LLM’s uit te gaan nutten, want de mogelijkheden blijken eindeloos en de vraag uit het bedrijf is enorm. Hierbij draag je ook actief kennis over aan de rest van het bedrijf volgens het principe voordoen, samen doen, controleren.
  
  

Hoe jouw dag als Large Language Model Developer eruitziet bij Stedin?
  
Na een heerlijke kop koffie (of thee) die je in gebarentaal bij onze ‘gebarista’ (slechthorende barista) hebt besteld, start je jouw dag met een stand\-up waarin je enthousiast de features bespreekt waaraan je werkt. Daarna heb je gelijk een meeting met de Lead Developer en Product Owner. Jullie kijken samen hoe een probleem uit het bedrijf opgelost kan worden met taalmodellen; iets waar de eindklant direct een bedrijfsproces mee kan verbeteren en echt resultaat oplevert voor in onze operatie. Wat zijn de wensen, en kan er direct nog meer waarde gecreëerd worden?
  
  

Lunchen doe je in het bedrijfsrestaurant op de 18e verdieping, zo geniet je van je eigen of verse lunch en van het uitzicht over heel Rotterdam. Of je loopt even de stad in voor een wandeling. Na de lunch ga je aan de slag met het technisch uitwerken van pilots of opschalingen waar je onder andere Azure OpenAI voor gebruikt. Of je maakt een PoC van een ander taalmodel waarmee je in korte tijd toetst of de oplossing financieel, technisch en functioneel haalbaar is voor Stedin.
  
  

Als afsluiter heb je nog een meeting met een architect en afdeling security over onze interne chat product StedinGPT. Hier heb je het over de toepasbaarheid van de gemaakte oplossing en hoe die terecht moet komen in het Stedin IT landschap; wat zijn de kaders, is de gemaakte MVP veilig en kunnen we dit in de toekomst beter standaardiseren? Aan het eind van je werkdag sta je in een paar stappen op station Blaak, zo ben je lekker snel weer thuis.
  
  

‘Wat ik erg tof vind aan mijn werk als LLM Developer bij Stedin, is dat ik maatschappelijke impact maak en werk met de nieuwste AI\-technologieën. In onze Generative AI team ontwikkelen we slimme oplossingen, waarbij we elkaars ideeën versterken, onze passie voor AI delen en altijd de laatste technologische ontwikkelingen volgen.’ Felicia Redelaar, LLM Developer.
  
  

Jouw sterke punten
  
Worden we blij van
  
  

Als onderdeel van het snel groeiende Generative AI team ben jij een verantwoordelijk persoon die veelzijdige taken op zich kan nemen en zelfstandig uit kunt werken. Generative AI is nog nieuw maar jij doorziet goed voor welk probleem welke oplossing geschikt is. Naast een dosis creativiteit zorg jij ook dat gemaakte oplossingen veilig zijn en klanten echt geholpen zijn met de eindoplossing. Als we zaken beter anders aanpakken of andere technologie moeten gebruiken om tot meer succes te komen kan je ons hier ook van overtuigen vanuit je technische basis. Je bent niet bang nieuwe ideeën uit te proberen in een PoC, maar bent ook sterk in langdurig goed werkende software af te leveren in productie, terwijl je steeds scherp blijft op het doel en de randvoorwaarden. Ook blijf je up\-to\-date met vernieuwingen op LLM gebied in de markt.
  
  

Wat jou verder onze nieuwe Large Language Model Developer maakt?
  
  

Je beschikt over hbo of wo werk\- en denkniveau bij voorkeur op het gebied van IT, AI en/of Computer Science.

Een goed team
  
Daar hoor je bij
  
  

Meteen vanaf dag één werk je in het Generative AI team. Dit team opereert als een DevOps team binnen een groot bedrijf en bestaat uit gedreven en enthousiaste Developers, die op zoek zijn samen met de Product Owner naar het toevoegen van waarde d.m.v. Generative AI. Dit snel groeiende team is in staat om snel nieuwe ideeën om te zetten in realiteit binnen de complexe context van de netbeheerder, bijvoorbeeld door het uitvoeren van kleinschalige MVP’s, maar ook het naar productie brengen van Generative AI binnen het IT landschap van Stedin.
  
  

Ons team werkt met een combinatie van de SAFe methode en probleemgericht innoveren en zorgt daarmee dat het bedrijf sneller en efficiënter kan werken. Daarmee hebben we dus een ontzettend belangrijke rol in het versnellen van de energietransitie! Ondanks dat we met 3 teams samen in onze ART opereren en ieder zijn of haar eigen specialisme heeft, hebben we heel veel contact met elkaar. Bijvoorbeeld als we allemaal samen zitten op onze 2 vaste kantoordagen, om te sparren over de beste oplossingsrichting, om te leren van elkaars ervaringen, tijdens de teamuitjes of met een lekkere kop koffie bij de koffiebar met het dakterras. We zijn goed op elkaar ingespeeld, ieders bijdrage wordt gewaardeerd en, niet onbelangrijk, elke dag moet er gelachen worden!
  
  

Mooie arbeidsvoorwaarden
  
Die wil je hebben
  
  

Dat je van ons je eigen telefoon (of een Bring Your Own Device vergoeding) en laptop krijgt, vinden we nogal vanzelfsprekend. Wat mag je nog meer van Stedin als werkgever verwachten?
  
  

Alle financiële arbeidsvoorwaarden op een rij, weet je meteen waar je aan toe bent:
  
  

Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden horen erbij. Zo krijg je een (maximaal) salaris van € 5\.700 gebaseerd op 40 uur per week en kennis en ervaring, 24,5 vakantiedagen en bouw je prima pensioen op bij het ABP.
  
  

Boven op je salaris ontvang je een persoonlijk budget van 24% (inclusief 8% vakantiegeld). Jij kiest elke maand wat je met het budget doet. Elke maand extra salaris? (Zo kun je ook € 6\.612 per maand inclusief 16% Persoonlijk Budget verdienen) Of meer verlofdagen? In onze nieuwe Rekentool krijg je alvast een voorproefje van hoe jouw persoonlijk budget eruit zou kunnen zien en hoe je het zou kunnen besteden.
  
  

Gezonde energie die heb je nodig. Daarom krijg je van ons ook een Duurzaam Inzetbaarheid budget van €500 bruto per jaar (bijvoorbeeld voor je sportabonnement, een hometrainer of je nieuwe sport outfit).
  
  

Volgens ons Stedin@Work concept werk je 50% thuis en 50% op kantoor, wel zo flexibel. Wij zorgen voor jouw thuiswerkfaciliteiten, een thuiswerkvergoeding en reizen naar kantoor doe je met je OV vrij\-abonnement waarmee je ook buiten werk onbeperkt kan reizen!
  
  

**Daar komt dit nog boven op:**  

Werken bij Stedin betekent werken bij een World\-class Workplace. Een van de trotspunten van onze (en jouw toekomstige) collega’s? Werksfeer.
  
  

**Jouw ontwikkeling staat centraal:** events bezoeken met collega’s, meedoen aan kennissessies, trainingen en opleidingen volgen. Zo geven we jouw talent écht alle kans en haal jij het beste uit jezelf.
  
  

Goede koffie van Heilige Boontjes.

Bekijk Onze
  
arbeidsvoorwaarden
  
  

Elke maand je Persoonlijk Budget kiezen
  
  

Het Persoonlijk Budget is een percentage van je bruto maandsalaris en ontvang je bovenop je salaris. Afhankelijk van je salarisschaal is dat tot 24% van je brutosalaris, inclusief 8% vakantiegeld. Je bepaalt zelf waaraan je het Persoonlijk Budget wilt besteden. Zo kun je het uit laten keren voor een maandelijks extraatje. Of je koopt extra verlofdagen.
  
  

Flexibele werktijden
  
  

Wil je zelf je werkweek indelen? Samen met je leidinggevende bepaal jij zo veel mogelijk je eigen werktijden. We werken 8 uur per dag. Afhankelijk van je werkzaamheden, heb je de mogelijkheid om, wanneer het kan, thuis te werken.
  
  

Vervoer
  
  

We zijn een duurzaam bedrijf. Reis je met het OV naar je werk, dan krijg je van ons een OV Vrij\-abonnement 2e klas. Dit abonnement mag je ook privé gebruiken. Kies je voor een vaste reiskostenvergoeding dan ontvang je 13 cent per kilometer (maximaal 60 kilometer enkele reis) voor de dagen dat je reist voor je werk. Met je Persoonlijk Budget kun je dit aanvullen tot 21 cent netto per kilometer. Krijg je je eigen bedrijfsauto of \-bus, dan mag je deze ook gebruiken voor woon\-werkverkeer. Voor zakelijk verkeer gebruiken we deelauto’s.

Zin in deze baan waar je vooroploopt in de energietransitie? Genoeg te doen bij Stedin! Doe je mee? Dat doe je met de knop 'solliciteren', je CV en motivatiebrief. We kijken ernaar uit je te ontmoeten!
  
  

Wie je ook bent, wat je ook doet, bij ons ben je welkom. Want als je jezelf bent, werkt het net wat beter.
  
  

Dankzij een (pre) employment screening en een assessment kunnen wij jou (en jij jezelf) nog beter leren kennen. Daarom maken deze onderdeel uit van de selectieprocedure.

Zie jij het werken aan de beste insurtech software van Nederland als de normaalste zaak van de wereld? Mooi, wij ook!

Als AI/ML Engineer bij Inpact ben je onderdeel van een ambitieus Feature Team dat gespecialiseerd is in het bouwen van innovatieve AI\-oplossingen voor de verzekeringssector. Samen met collega\-experts werk je aan geavanceerde technologieën zoals Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) en Deep Learning (DL). Dagelijks werkt het feature team aan Inpact.AI, om verzekeringsprofessionals te helpen om snel en effectief grote hoeveelheden data te verwerken, waaronder polissen, claims, rapporten, e\-mails, PDF’s, afbeeldingen en andere vormen van digitale informatie.

In jouw rol ontwerp, ontwikkel en implementeer je ook nieuwe baanbrekende AI\-modellen en oplossingen—zoals Large Language Models (LLM’s) in combinatie met Retrieval\-Augmented Generation (RAG). Je werkt nauw samen met jouw team aan het optimaliseren van prestaties, verhogen van schaalbaarheid en het realiseren van tastbare resultaten die impact hebben.

**Een normale dag bij Inpact**

Bij Inpact helpen we verzekeraars innoveren, zodat zij tijd en focus overhouden voor het échte werk. Als AI/ML Engineer bouw je mee aan de toekomst van verzekeren. Zonder poespas, mét resultaat. Ja, we zijn ambitieus. Maar hier geen overmatig werken of competitie over functietitels. Grote ego's laten we buiten, grootse plannen verwelkomen we met open armen. Daarom nemen we ook aan op ambitie, in plaats van op ervaring. Ons team bestaat uit een hechte club van 100 nuchtere collega's (waarvan zeker 70 tech\-specialisten) met een passie voor technologie, AI en Data Science. We doen niet aan gedoe, we doen vooral heel normaal terwijl we complexe data omzetten naar waardevolle inzichten voor verzekeraars.

**Zo bouw jij mee aan de toekomst van verzekeren**

We hebben het al genoemd: wij zoeken mensen die gewoon goed werk doen. Geen poespas, wél baanbrekend werk. Geen opschepperij, wél trots op wat we samen bereiken. En als AI/ML Engineer verwachten we dat je:

* Een relevante wo\-opleiding hebt in Data Science, Informatica, Wiskunde, Kunstmatige Intelligentie of Econometrie.
* Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring hebt met frameworks en tools voor machine learning en deep learning, zoals PyTorch en Sklearn.
* Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring hebt met Large Language Models(LLM), waaronder fine\-tuning, prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\-systemen.
* Ervaring met het ontwikkelen en implementeren van machine learning\-oplossingen met grootschalige datasets, inclusief specificatieontwerp, dataverzameling en \-labeling, modelontwikkeling, validatie, implementatie en voortdurende monitoring.
* Ervaring hebt met Python, C\# of Java en source control (Git).
* Een pré als je ervaring hebt met cloudplatforms (bijv. AWS, Azure, GCP).
* Ervaring met data engineering pipelines.
* Proactief, analytisch en samenwerkingsgericht bent.

**Dit vinden wij de normaalste zaak van de wereld**

In één jaar van 10 naar 100 klanten groeien? Dat vinden wij niet gek. Een starter die binnen no\-time haar eigen team aanstuurt? Kan gewoon. En de koffie? Gewoon een kop normale koffie, ténzij je het anders wilt natuurlijk. Wat we nog meer normaal vinden?

* Een competitief salaris
* Prima pensioenregeling waarmee je oude dag gewoon goed geregeld is
* Nieuwe hardware zoals een Lenovo laptop, BOSE headset en veel AI tools
* Gewoon vanuit huis kunnen werken, met een onbelaste thuiswerkvergoeding van €2,35 per dag
* 25 verlofdagen op basis van een 40\-urige werkweek
* Een persoonlijk budget en ontwikkelplan om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen via o.a. Udemy Business
* Volop kansen om te groeien, zonder politiek geneuzel
* Gewoon op tijd naar huis voor het avondeten
* Je functie vormen naar je eigen ambities
* Gratis parkeren voor de deur
* Regelmatige gezellige uitjes, lunches, borrels, LAN\-party's en spelletjesavonden
* Regelmatige BBQ's, LAN\-party's en robot rally's

**Ook gewoon goed werk doen?**

We kunnen jouw nuchtere instelling goed gebruiken om samen de beste insurtech van Nederland te worden. Klik op de solliciteerknop of stuur je sollicitatie naar gijs@inpact.recruitee.com.

**The role**

The objective of the proposed internship is to review the characteristics (e.g. wear, corrosion and performance) of components subject to varying slurry pipe system conditions, such as flow, density, pressure and soil type.


**Key accountabilities**

### **Background**

Dredging equipment is subject to harsh conditions. Exposure to maritime, saline environments is already demanding for most steel structures. In addition, the dredging process itself and the way the equipment is operated and maintained pose extra challenges to the design of the equipment.


The RD\&I department of Damen Dredging Equipment (DDE) owns an innovative sediment transport test circuit. The circuit simulates all circumstances of the transport of a sand/water mixture and can be used for dredge production estimations and wear predictions. The infinite circuit is intended to simulate the harsh conditions of a real dredge installation. The standard test pipe is a 8\.0m long straight pipe section of ø250mm for the installation of components or prototypes to be tested in the dredge processes.


Test projects envisaged to be carried out in the near future are a.o.:


* Research and comparison on wear resistance of various liner materials for pipes and sensors;
* Testing pump performances under various wear conditions of pump parts, and predictive maintenance methods;
* Measuring the effect of different soil types, viscosity, gas content etc. on pump performance;
* Testing performance and life time of novel process sensors;
* Testing process control and visualization systems.

Details of above projects can be elaborated in a job interview with the candidate.


### **Description**

An internship project typically consist of the following activities, however these items are depending per test objective, and the terms defined by the educational programme:


* Literature study;
* Design and run analytical models of physical processes (by CFD, Matlab, MathCAD,…);
* Negotiations with the supplier of components which are to be tested;
* Set up of the test program, including all varying conditions;
* CAD design and coordinate fabrication of specific test sample holders, or modifications to the test circuit and facilities;
* Mounting of the samples in the circuit;
* Executing the tests, monitoring and possibly operating the circuit (partly remote controlled);
* Preferably coordinating or carrying out repair and maintenance on the test facility;
* Collecting test data and analyzing the measuring results;
* Validating analytical models with the measuring results;
* Reporting and demonstrations to stakeholders within the project;
* Taking responsibility for your own project management….

**Skills \& experience**

* Bachelor or secondary education student in Mechanical Engineering, Automotive Engineering, Maritime Engineering, Civil Engineering, Dredging Engineering, Fluid Dynamics, Material Physics or Energy Technology;
* Autonomous, practical mindset and result driven. Proven skills in repairing cars, motor bikes or any machine. A curious attitude. Good communication skills;
* Good command of English, especially in writing.

**What we offer**

The project will be carried out at the DDE yard location in Nijkerk. A monthly allowance will be paid for the duration of the assignment. Flexible working hours can be discussed and proper mentoring at HBO or academic level will be available throughout the project.

Description of the assignment
Data and Analytics are currently in the spotlight at Vanderlande. A large board\-level driven change program has led to the introduction of a new data platform according to the Data Mesh methodology and the rapid adoption of Azure cloud technology. This is an ideal time to come aboard and make your mark on a company that provides baggage handling systems for 600 airports around the globe and automates the warehouses and sorting centres of the world’s leading parcel and e\-commerce businesses.
Whether you join us as an intern to gain work experience or to write your thesis in a non\-theoretical environment, every bit of value you deliver for us is a win.
Department description
You will become part of Vanderlande’s growing Central Analytics department. Together with our Central Data organization we build and further expand our Analytical plane. By enriching and transforming data we allow our organization to work Data Driven. Our Director reports directly to the CFO of Vanderlande. Our Portfolio Management Board (the people who give us direction) consists of leadership from each of our domains like Sales, Finance, HR, Supply, Project Execution etc.

We trust you will like it enough to do a lot more than that.
Your profile
Our team writes most of the code in Python and/or SQL. Any experience with these languages will allow you to participate in the actual development. If you have none, we highly advice you to train yourself via one of the several available online resources beforehand.
Furthermore, knowledge on the following will help you, but is not expected:* Building data pipelines and managing them in a production environment.
* DevOps tooling like test automation and CI/CD.
+ Mandatory enrolment to a Dutch Education System \& resident of The Netherlands.

-----------------


Do you want to contribute and collaborate to shape the future of human\-centric computing models and applications with an eye on society? Then keep reading, this fully funded PhD position at Vrije Universiteit (VU)Amsterdam may be for you!


Human\-centric AI aims to steer the development and application of AI towards personal and social good while minimizing harm. It builds on the capabilities of generative AI and foundation model techniques and enhances their ability to be collaborative, adaptive, responsible, and explainable (abbreviated as CARE principles). Human\-centric AI can enable effective human\-AI teaming, leading to hybrid systems that yield more than the sum of their parts. However, as an emerging discipline, human\-centric AI and its principles have resulted in a wide range of proposed systems, leading to a poorly understood landscape of requirements, benefits, and limitations. It remains challenging to design effective human\-centric AI systems, i.e., systems that reliably achieve the CARE principles without substantially harming other important quality attributes (QAs) like maintainability or energy consumption. As a solution, the synthesis and curation of software architecture techniques like design decisions, architectural tactics, patterns, or reference architectures can enable practitioners to design human\-centric systems, while supporting the reasoning about trade\-offs between various quality attributes, e.g., explainability, maintainability, or energy consumption.


The Learning and Reasoning and the Software and Sustainability groups are looking for a joint PhD student in **software architecture for human\-centric AI**. The project will survey the emerging landscape of systems in human\-centric AI, investigate how to systematically organize them into modular building blocks, and from there into reusable software architecture techniques. The project will investigate how the various design decisions influence the CARE principles, as well as other QAs like maintainability, evolvability, or performance efficiency. Taking a system perspective that is shaped by quality attribute trade\-offs, the PhD student will synthesize and evaluate software architecture design techniques to support practitioners building such systems. To bridge the gap between these two fields, the PhD student will be supported by one supervisor with extensive human\-centric AI expertise (Dr. Filip Ilievski) and one supervisor with extensive software architecture expertise (Dr. Justus Bogner).


**Your duties**


* shape and refine the indicated research topic according to your interests
* conduct research on the indicated topic using a variety of research methods
* publish the results as scientific papers in prestigious SE and / or AI venues

**Jij en jouw functie**


Als Data Analist Thematic Investigations draag je bij aan een betere maatschappij door detectie en preventie van grootschalige financieel\-economische criminaliteit (FEC) door data te analyseren van onze 9\+ miljoen klanten.


Het bestrijden van witwassen en terrorisme financiering zijn belangrijke onderwerpen voor de maatschappij en voor onze organisatie! Om succesvol financieel\-economische criminaliteit te bestrijden hebben wij slimme mensen zoals jij nodig, die het uitdagend vinden om data, patronen en gedrag van onze klanten te bestuderen om illegale activiteiten te ontdekken. Je maakt deel uit van een expertiseafdeling die als doel heeft “*to detect the undetected*” en door nauw samen te werken met FEC\-analisten met verschillende domeinexpertise help jij mee om kenmerken van bepaalde FEC\-typologieën te abstraheren, te onderzoeken of die voorkomen in onze data en om die data om te zetten naar inzichten waarop gepaste actie kan worden ondernomen om het financiële stelsel integer te houden. Op termijn zullen geavanceerdere analyse technieken zoals Machine Learning een rol gaan spelen bij deze *feature and pattern discovery and extraction.*


Het werk vereist statistische kennis, een analytische geest en pragmatische operationele vaardigheden. Dit zal leiden tot het verbeteren van detectiemodellen en tot kennis die wij uitdragen naar de rest van de FEC\-organisatie om Rabobank robuuster te maken tegen misbruik van onze financiële producten.


Jouw data\-expertise is belangrijk voor het team; maar andersom zal je ook veel leren van de kennis en ervaring van je teamleden en FEC\-collega’s. De afdeling FEC Investigations valt direct onder de groepsdirectie via de Chief FEC Officer (CFECO) en bestaat uit management, analisten en adviseurs en kenmerkt zich door een diversiteit in achtergronden, kennis en ervaring. Je wordt onderdeel van het datateam dat zich bezighoudt met query's en analyses en je hebt een nauwe samenwerking met de overige teams binnen FEC Investigations te weten team Quick Response, /Subsidiaires/sancties, team CDD, team PPP (Publiek Private Partijen) en het Thema team.

**Voorbeelden uit de Praktijk**

* Je wordt betrokken bij verschillende projecten die gerelateerd zijn aan bepaald type financieel\-economische criminaliteit waarbij je nauw samenwerkt met FEC\-analisten.
* Je ‘vertaalt’, in multidisciplinaire teams, de thema onderzoek suggesties van de analisten in data query's en regels die helpen bij het ontdekken van patronen van illegale activiteiten.
* Je draagt bij in de verdere ontwikkeling van onze (data) onderzoeks omgeving, nieuwe tooling, GenAI en data capabilities van onze FEC analisten;
* Je wacht niet af, maar je zoekt mee naar meer nuttige databronnen zowel binnen als buiten de bank, die bij kunnen dragen aan verbetering van de rule\-based modellen. Je stemt dit af met de FEC Investigations analisten om tot de juiste keuzes te komen.
* Samen met domeinexperts op het gebied van betalen, financiële producten, witwassen en terrorisme financiering ga je op zoek naar nieuwe criminele modus operandi die mogelijk nog verborgen is in de data.
* Je werkt samen met andere data\-experts binnen de bank om nuttige combinaties van data te vinden, de juiste context te snappen en om goed te begrijpen hoe de data kan worden gebruikt.
* De datakwaliteit bewaak je en houdt dataleveranciers hierop scherp.
* Je ondersteunt de analisten bij het visualiseren van data voor beter inzicht en rapportage naar het management in rapporten en dashboards.
* Wanneer en dataverzoek bij een ander tem wordt neergelegd, werk je samen met de analist om tot de juiste vraagstelling te komen en om de opgeleverde dataset te beoordelen.

**Feiten \& Cijfers**

* Het betreft een functie voor 32\-36 uur per week;
* Bij FEC Investigations heb je ongeveer 90 collega's;
* Je werkt hybride: je bent gemiddeld 1 dag per week aanwezig op kantoor Croeselaan Utrecht en verder werk je vanuit huis of een ander Rabobankkantoor.

**Jij \& Jouw talent**

*Een salaris in schaal 9 of 10 kan van toepassing zijn voor deze rol, dit is afhankelijk van jouw ervaring in vergelijking met de andere collega’s die in dezelfde schaal werken en wordt nader bepaald op basis van de interviews.*


Dat klant\- en resultaatgerichtheid, communicatiekracht, flexibiliteit, pro\-activiteit, innovatiekracht, zelfstandigheid en overtuigingskracht onmisbaar zijn voor de functie van (Senior) Analyst Thematic Investigations is logisch. Daarbovenop is het belangrijk dat je jezelf in onderstaande zaken herkent:

* Academische opleiding in Data Science, Statistiek, Econometrie, Wiskunde of vergelijkbaar;
* Minimaal 5 jaar ervaring in advanced analytics, modelling, AI (idealiter met big data), SQL, PowerBI, Python, PySpark en Spark (Azure Synapse Analytics, en/of Azure Databricks experience is een plus);
* Uitstekende algemene IT vaardigheden voor een bredere context;
* Uitstekende beheersing van het Nederlands en Engels in zowel woord als geschrift;
* Je werkt gestructureerd, precies en met collega’s met verschillende achtergronden en ervaring. Je hebt een ‘can\-do’ mentaliteit en maakt daarmee het verschil in onze ambitie tot ‘detect the undetected’;

Zo staat ITQ bekend als een innovatieve IT Solution Provider en heeft ITQ o.a. een sterke positie binnen de Nederlandse Healthcare\-markt waar we ruim 65\.000 zorgprofessionals voorzien van een moderne digitale werkplekken. Tevens bieden we hoogwaardige diensten en oplossingen op het gebied van hybride cloud, MSP\-services en cloud\-native technologieën.

  

Om onze groei verder te versterken, zoeken wij een ervaren dealmaker / bidmanager met minimaal 8 jaar ervaring in IT\-sales. Dus ben jij op zoek naar een rol waar je écht impact kan maken? Solliciteer dan snel.

  



**Jouw rol als dealmaker / bidmanager bij ITQ:**


Als dealmaker \& bidmanager ben je verantwoordelijk voor het coördineren en beheren van het gehele bid\-proces, vanaf het moment dat we verwachten dat de RfP komt, tot en met het indienen van de definitieve offerte en daarna, bij voorlopige gunning, voor de onderhandelingen en contractering. Waarbij hij gedurende de bid fase\* ook verantwoordelijk is voor het bepalen, samen met het team, van de winstrategie.


Deze functie vereist een combinatie van projectmanagement\-vaardigheden, strategisch en analytisch denken, uitstekende communicatievaardigheden waarbij het ook belangrijk is dat de bidmanager zijn regie\- en coördinerende rol durft te pakken.


De toekomstige bidmanager dient niet alleen bids te begeleiden, deze dient tevens te kijken hoe ITQ slimmer en steeds efficiënter offertes kunnen gaan schrijven.


Je werkt nauw samen met collega’s zoals Solution Sales, Pre\-Sales Consultants, Service Delivery Managers en Solution Architects om op maat gemaakte oplossingen te bieden die waarde toevoegen voor onze klanten.

 **Wat je gaat doen:**


Een Dealmaker/Bidmanager speelt een sleutelrol in het binnenhalen van strategische deals en aanbestedingen. Hij of zij maakt, samen met het bidteam, een dealkwalificatie, analyseert klantbehoeften, coördineert interne teams en stelt concurrerende offertes en voorstellen op en is verantwoordelijk voor een kloppende businesscase inclusief risico log. De focus ligt op het ontwikkelen van een winnende strategie, onderhandelen over contractvoorwaarden en het bewaken van deadlines. Een dealmaker richt zich meer op de commerciële en strategische aspecten van een deal, terwijl een bidmanager zorgt voor een gestructureerd en compliant bidproces. Samenwerken met interne\- en externe stakeholders is essentieel om een sterke waarde propositie neer te zetten en gedragenheid te verkrijgen. De bidmanager beheert het volledige tenderproces en zorgt ervoor dat alle technische, juridische en financiële aspecten kloppen. De dealmaker stuurt het onderhandelingsproces en zorgt dat de deal wordt gesloten onder optimale voorwaarden voor beide partijen.

 **Jouw profiel**


Je hebt bij voorkeur meer dan 8 jaar ervaring in deze rol. Het is een pre als je die ervaring hebt opgedaan binnen de IT dus dat je begrijpt hoe IT\-oplossingen waarde toevoegen voor klanten en dat weet te positioneren. Het is ook nadrukkelijk een pre als ervaring hebt in 'legal'.

 **Wat we verder van jou vragen:**

*✔ Projectmanagement \& bidcoördinatie – Beheer van complexe bidtrajecten met strakke deadlines en meerdere stakeholders waarbij je het vermogen hebt om onder druk te werken en deadlines te halen*

*✔ Goede communicatieve vaardigheden – Zowel schriftelijk als mondeling overtuigend richting klanten en interne teams*

*✔* Teamgericht en in staat om effectief samen te werken met verschillende afdelingen

*✔ Strategisch\- als ook analytisch\- en probleemoplossend vermogen*

*✔ Kennis van IT\-aanbestedingen \& contractmanagement – Ervaring met Europese aanbestedingen, contractstructuren en SLA\-beheer*

*✔ Commercieel en strategisch denken – In staat om marktkansen te herkennen en winnende proposities te ontwikkelen voor managed services en cloudgebaseerde IT\-infrastructuur.*

*✔ Sterke onderhandelingsvaardigheden – Ervaring met het sluiten van langlopende IT\-contracten, outsourcing en pay\-per\-use modellen.*

*✔ Kennis van Managed Werkplek \& Cloud\-oplossingen – Inzicht in Microsoft 365, Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD), Intune, endpoint security, DaaS (Desktop\-as\-a\-Service) en ITSM\-frameworks (ITIL, COBIT).*

*✔ Uitstekende beheersing Nederlands en Engels in woord en schrift*

*✔ Hands\-on mentaliteit*

**Interessegebieden:** Cloud, Kubernetes, energie, green software, duurzaamheid, open\-source


Een van onze klanten binnen de industriesector draait meer dan 170 Kubernetes\-clusters, verspreid over on\-premise datacenters en Azure. Voor hen is het belangrijk om inzicht te krijgen in het energieverbruik van applicaties binnen die clusters, niet alleen voor intern gebruik, maar ook om hierover te kunnen rapporteren richting hun eigen klanten.


Maar dat is makkelijker gezegd dan gedaan. Kubernetes\-omgevingen zijn complex en zijn dynamisch van aard. Er bestaan wel open\-source tools, maar het is nog de vraag of die goed genoeg werken om energieverbruik en CO2\-uitstoot echt nauwkeurig en bruikbaar in beeld te brengen en te verminderen. Er is een gebrek aan duidelijkheid over de geschiktheid en toepasbaarheid van deze oplossingen in de context van energieverbruik en CO2\-uitstoot binnen het IT\-landschap, daarom is het tijd om dat uit te zoeken.

**De opdracht**
---------------


Jij gaat oplossingen onderzoeken en vergelijken voor het meten van energieverbruik binnen Kubernetes\-omgevingen. Het doel: aantonen dat dit verbruik inzichtelijk te maken is via een Proof of Concept.

  

Daarnaast onderzoek je hoe je real\-time CO2\-uitstoot van Kubernetes\-omgevingen inzichtelijk kunt maken, bijvoorbeeld via een koppeling met de lokale energiemix. Ook kijk je hoe je hierover kunt rapporteren op applicatie\- of productniveau. Zulke rapportages zijn waardevol om plannen te maken voor het terugdringen van uitstoot en het zichtbaar maken van de impact van IT.


Deze afstudeeropdracht biedt je de kans om te werken aan een actueel en technisch uitdagend vraagstuk, terwijl je relevante ervaring opdoet met duurzaamheid binnen Kubernetes\-clusters. En nog belangrijker: je draagt direct bij aan het verduurzamen van IT.


Je zou bijvoorbeeld kunnen werken aan:

* Een onderzoek naar de beste methodes en tools om energieverbruik te meten in Kubernetes, inclusief aanbevelingen voor gebruik bij klanten van Info Support.
* Een Proof of Concept voor een tool die energieverbruik in Kubernetes\-clusters effectief kan meten en visualiseren.
* Een vergelijkend onderzoek naar open\-source oplossingen voor het meten van energieverbruik en CO2\-uitstoot, gecombineerd met een Proof of Concept voor de meest veelbelovende oplossing.
* Een applicatie die real\-time inzicht geeft in CO2\-uitstoot via koppeling met data over de lokale energiemix.


Samen bepalen we welke scope en resultaten het best aansluiten bij jouw opleiding en interesses. Zo krijg je ruimte om je eigen stempel te drukken op de opdracht én op het eindresultaat.

Op dit moment kost het handmatig onderhouden van Infrastructure as Code (IaC) nog veel tijd, terwijl die beter besteed kan worden aan innovatie en development. In deze opdracht onderzoek je hoe monitoring en automatisering kunnen helpen om dit proces te verbeteren. Jouw uitdaging: een slimme aanpak ontwikkelen waarmee IaC moeiteloos up\-to\-date blijft, zodat developers efficiënter en effectiever kunnen werken.**

**Interessegebieden:** Azure, infrastructure, pipelines

  

Om de infrastructuur vast te leggen en herhaaldelijk uit te rollen, wordt gebruik gemaakt van BICEP of ARM, de Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\-oplossingen van Microsoft.


Hoewel deze aanpak helpt om infrastructuur gestructureerd en herbruikbaar te definiëren, is het proces om de IaC te onderhouden grotendeels handmatig. Dit proces kan behoorlijk tijdrovend zijn, terwijl deze tijd beter elders besteed kan worden.


We zien daarom een kans om dit proces gedeeltelijk te automatiseren. Zo is er meer tijd voor development\-georiënteerde projecten en klantgerichte features en hebben developers de ruimte om te focussen op het creëren van waardevolle functionaliteiten die directe impact hebben voor de klant.


Hieronder staan drie belangrijke uitdagingen die kunnen ontstaan wanneer IaC niet goed wordt bijgehouden. Dit biedt juist kansen om met een geautomatiseerd proces deze problemen op te lossen en de infrastructuurbeheerprocessen te verbeteren.


**Verouderde infrastructuur en onnodige kosten**


Wanneer de code niet regelmatig wordt bijgehouden, kunnen nieuwe infrastructuurversies of configuraties worden gemist. Dit kan leiden tot:

* Componenten die ""end of life"" zijn en niet meer worden ondersteund.
* Onnodige kosten doordat er nieuwere, goedkopere versies beschikbaar zijn die niet worden benut.

**Handmatige aanpassingen**


Handmatig uitgevoerde wijzigingen die niet in de IaC zijn vastgelegd maken het lastig om inzicht te krijgen in de infrastructuur. Dit leidt tot:

* Problemen bij latere updates of aanpassingen, omdat de code niet meer overeenkomt met de daadwerkelijke infrastructuur.
* Tijdrovende en foutgevoelige processen bij het handmatig controleren en bijwerken van de code, vooral in complexe omgevingen.

**Inconsistenties door tijdsdruk en handmatig werk**


Onder druk, bijvoorbeeld bij beveiligingsupdates of strakke deadlines, wordt de IaC soms genegeerd of worden wijzigingen handmatig doorgevoerd. Dit brengt risico's met zich mee, zoals:

* Inconsistenties tussen de code en de infrastructuur.
* Onduidelijkheid over welke wijzigingen zijn doorgevoerd en wat de impact ervan is.

**De opdracht**
---------------


Gedurende deze opdracht moeten de volgende drie onderzoeksvragen worden beantwoord:


* **Hoe kan de monitoring van nieuwe versies van infrastructuurcomponenten het beste worden geïntegreerd in bestaande projecten?**
Deze vraag richt zich op het vinden van de optimale methode om een monitoringoplossing te implementeren die automatisch controleert op nieuwe versies van de gebruikte infrastructuurcomponenten, zodat de code up\-to\-date blijft. Het is ook belangrijk om te onderzoeken hoe uitgebreid deze analyse kan zijn: blijft het beperkt tot het herkennen van nieuwe versies, of kan er ook advies worden gegeven over het gebruik van nieuwe componenten om kosten te besparen?


* **Hoe kan de consistentie tussen Infrastructure as Code en de werkelijke infrastructuur gewaarborgd worden?**
Deze vraag onderzoekt welke maatregelen genomen kunnen worden om ervoor te zorgen dat BICEP een valide bron van waarheid blijft voor de staat van de infrastructuur. Dit kan ook inhouden dat handmatige wijzigingen in het Azure Portal worden beperkt, hoewel dit ook zijn eigen nadelen met zich meebrengt. Het is dus niet noodzakelijk om naar een softwarematige oplossing te kijken.


* **Welke andere metrics met betrekking tot Infrastructure as Code zijn relevant om te monitoren, zodat de kwaliteit van de code verder kan worden verbeterd?**
Dit is een bredere vraag die onderzoekt of er, naast versies en consistentie, nog andere metrics van belang zijn voor het effectief onderhouden van infrastructure as code.
Tijdens deze opdracht moeten de volgende twee problemen worden aangepakt:


* **Onvoldoende inzicht in nieuwe versies van infrastructuurcomponenten**
Het is lastig om te weten wanneer er nieuwe versies van de gebruikte componenten beschikbaar zijn. Dit kan leiden tot verouderde configuraties, die mogelijk niet optimaal of veilig zijn.


* **Inconsistentie tussen de Infrastructure as Code en de werkelijke infrastructuur**
Handmatige wijzigingen in de werkelijke infrastructuur worden niet altijd in de code vastgelegd, waardoor de code niet meer overeenkomt met de feitelijke situatie. Dit kan leiden tot misconfiguraties en onderhoudsproblemen.


Het doel van de opdracht is om deze problemen op te lossen, op basis van de bevonden methoden uit het onderzoek.

Zo staat ITQ bekend als een innovatieve IT Solution Provider en heeft ITQ o.a. een sterke positie binnen de Nederlandse Healthcare\-markt waar we ruim 65\.000 zorgprofessionals voorzien van een moderne digitale werkplekken. Tevens bieden we hoogwaardige diensten en oplossingen op het gebied van hybride cloud, MSP\-services en cloud\-native technologieën.

  

Om onze groei verder te versterken, zoeken wij een ervaren dealmaker / bidmanager met minimaal 8 jaar ervaring in IT\-sales. Dus ben jij op zoek naar een rol waar je écht impact kan maken? Solliciteer dan snel.

  



**Jouw rol als dealmaker / bidmanager bij ITQ:**


Als dealmaker \& bidmanager ben je verantwoordelijk voor het coördineren en beheren van het gehele bid\-proces, vanaf het moment dat we verwachten dat de RfP komt, tot en met het indienen van de definitieve offerte en daarna, bij voorlopige gunning, voor de onderhandelingen en contractering. Waarbij hij gedurende de bid fase\* ook verantwoordelijk is voor het bepalen, samen met het team, van de winstrategie.


Deze functie vereist een combinatie van projectmanagement\-vaardigheden, strategisch en analytisch denken, uitstekende communicatievaardigheden waarbij het ook belangrijk is dat de bidmanager zijn regie\- en coördinerende rol durft te pakken.


De toekomstige bidmanager dient niet alleen bids te begeleiden, deze dient tevens te kijken hoe ITQ slimmer en steeds efficiënter offertes kunnen gaan schrijven.


Je werkt nauw samen met collega’s zoals Solution Sales, Pre\-Sales Consultants, Service Delivery Managers en Solution Architects om op maat gemaakte oplossingen te bieden die waarde toevoegen voor onze klanten.

 **Wat je gaat doen:**


Een Dealmaker/Bidmanager speelt een sleutelrol in het binnenhalen van strategische deals en aanbestedingen. Hij of zij maakt, samen met het bidteam, een dealkwalificatie, analyseert klantbehoeften, coördineert interne teams en stelt concurrerende offertes en voorstellen op en is verantwoordelijk voor een kloppende businesscase inclusief risico log. De focus ligt op het ontwikkelen van een winnende strategie, onderhandelen over contractvoorwaarden en het bewaken van deadlines. Een dealmaker richt zich meer op de commerciële en strategische aspecten van een deal, terwijl een bidmanager zorgt voor een gestructureerd en compliant bidproces. Samenwerken met interne\- en externe stakeholders is essentieel om een sterke waarde propositie neer te zetten en gedragenheid te verkrijgen. De bidmanager beheert het volledige tenderproces en zorgt ervoor dat alle technische, juridische en financiële aspecten kloppen. De dealmaker stuurt het onderhandelingsproces en zorgt dat de deal wordt gesloten onder optimale voorwaarden voor beide partijen.

 **Jouw profiel**


Je hebt bij voorkeur meer dan 8 jaar ervaring in deze rol. Het is een pre als je die ervaring hebt opgedaan binnen de IT dus dat je begrijpt hoe IT\-oplossingen waarde toevoegen voor klanten en dat weet te positioneren. Het is ook nadrukkelijk een pre als ervaring hebt in 'legal'.

 **Wat we verder van jou vragen:**

*✔ Projectmanagement \& bidcoördinatie – Beheer van complexe bidtrajecten met strakke deadlines en meerdere stakeholders waarbij je het vermogen hebt om onder druk te werken en deadlines te halen*

*✔ Goede communicatieve vaardigheden – Zowel schriftelijk als mondeling overtuigend richting klanten en interne teams*

*✔* Teamgericht en in staat om effectief samen te werken met verschillende afdelingen

*✔ Strategisch\- als ook analytisch\- en probleemoplossend vermogen*

*✔ Kennis van IT\-aanbestedingen \& contractmanagement – Ervaring met Europese aanbestedingen, contractstructuren en SLA\-beheer*

*✔ Commercieel en strategisch denken – In staat om marktkansen te herkennen en winnende proposities te ontwikkelen voor managed services en cloudgebaseerde IT\-infrastructuur.*

*✔ Sterke onderhandelingsvaardigheden – Ervaring met het sluiten van langlopende IT\-contracten, outsourcing en pay\-per\-use modellen.*

*✔ Kennis van Managed Werkplek \& Cloud\-oplossingen – Inzicht in Microsoft 365, Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD), Intune, endpoint security, DaaS (Desktop\-as\-a\-Service) en ITSM\-frameworks (ITIL, COBIT).*

*✔ Uitstekende beheersing Nederlands en Engels in woord en schrift*

*✔ Hands\-on mentaliteit*

**Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Senior Manager Data Architect help je organisaties binnen de financiële sector met de ontwikkeling en implementatie van data platformen en \-oplossingen. Je speelt hierbij een vooraanstaande rol in de opdrachtuitvoering, onderhoudt contacten met belangrijke stakeholders en bouwt sterke relaties op met leveranciers van data platformen. Je werkt nauw samen met experts uit andere Data \& Analytics\-specialisaties, zoals BI, data analytics en data management.


Het Connected Enterprise\-framework helpt bedrijven succesvol te digitaliseren door meerdere bedrijfsgebieden met elkaar te verbinden, zoals klantenservice, technologie en processen, waarbij de klant centraal staat. Door deze geïntegreerde aanpak kunnen organisaties efficiënter en flexibeler opereren, waarde creëren en duurzame groei bevorderen, terwijl ze beter inspelen op de behoeften van hun klanten.


Bij KPMG zien we digitalisering niet als een einddoel, maar als een middel om organisaties om te vormen tot een Connected Enterprise die zowel wendbaar als efficiënt is in een steeds veranderende toekomst. Het transformeren van een productgeoriënteerde naar een klantgeoriënteerde organisatie, waarbij de klant centraal staat in elke stap van de transformatie; dát is waar het uiteindelijk om gaat. Dit betekent dat we bedrijven helpen niet alleen hun interne processen te verbeteren, maar ook om strategische verbindingen te leggen tussen hun medewerkers, klanten en partners. Je werkt intensief met elkaar samen in interdisciplinaire teams, waarbij jij vanuit het klantperspectief bijdraagt. Samen komen we met passende strategische oplossingen voor onze klanten om hen te helpen bij het realiseren van hun (digitale) ambities.

At Stacks, we’re transforming the way finance teams approach one of their most critical processes: the monthly close.

We believe this needs to change.


Our vision is bold. With the power of AI, we’re reimagining the monthly close to be as simple as a single click—providing the most accurate, detailed financial insights on day one of each month. By giving finance teams their time back, we enable them to focus on high\-impact, strategic work that drives their companies forward.


Our team is a blend of finance, product, and technical experts from top\-tier companies like Uber, Plaid, Miro, Mollie, and Bunq, united by the drive to create a game\-changing solution. Based in the heart of Amsterdam, our office offers inspiring views over the iconic canals.
