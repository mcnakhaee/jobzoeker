**Background**


Within ING we make use of data science for a variety of use cases (such as improving financial health of our customers by transaction forecasting). The data science models which run in production all generate output this data needs to be delivered to different destination within ING. These destinations vary from data lakes and kafka topics to Cassandra datastores.


In the past a generic Interface format (GI) was developed as a one size fits all solution to standardize the output delivery for our data-scientists. Over time many models have adopted this interface but we are now facing challenges such as files which became too big or the throughput time is too long.

**The opportunity**


We would like to deep-dive into this topic by dedicating an intern as engineer to investigate our use cases and look for a future proof solution. This includes gathering information, do market research (buy vs built) and design / develop one or more prototypes together with our data-scientists data engineers.

**Team** **overview**


You, as an intern will join one of our data-engineering teams which support the ING data-scientists. The teams work on a variety of topics to maintain and evolve our data-analytics environment in Google Cloud.

* Located in our Amsterdam office.
* Mix of local and off-shore colleagues (so multiple nationalities)
* We work in agile teams based around Scrum and continuous delivery principles.
* Our teams work in hybrid mode, we work from home when possible and work from the office at least one day a week.
* We have 36 hour working weeks.

**Roles and responsibilities**


This assignment is about understanding and improving our way of distributing data-science model output. The current implementation of GI (Generic Interface) needs to be examined as well as our use cases and the industry standards available. The goal is to boost new alternatives and bring us further in achieving an excellent data-driven organization.

**Expected l****earnings**

You will be working in an environment with modern continuous delivery tools with people who have a continuous improvement mindset. Tools include Azure (CDaaS), Google GCP (Terraform, Vertex AI, BigQuery), NiFi for data flow management.


Working in a complex environment such as ING can be challenging and this is part of the learning and our people and teams are there to help you.


Communication and collaboration are key and this involves working closely together with domain experts such as data-engineers, data-scientists and machine learning engineers.

**Expected output**


An inventory of required features, an improved understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the current implementation and a redesign plus implementation plan (part of this can also contain a buy vs built decision or a vendor selection).


When time allows the output also consists of the implementation of a prototype solution.

**How to succeed**


You can succeed in this role by showing:

* a “can-do” mentality
* you are a “self starter” (pro-active)
* you speak out and like to challenge yourself and the people around you
* you have a background in IT, information management or similar
* experience and affinity with machine learning is very useful
* it helps if you like programming (python, java, scala) though this is not a show stopper

**Rewards and benefits**  

This is a great opportunity to train with highly skilled people who are experts in their field. You’ll do a lot and learn a lot –  

not only about your specialist area and the bank, but also about yourself and whether this type of environment is right for you.

  

You’ll also benefit from:

* Internship allowance of EUR 700/month for 36 hours (maximum)
* Compensation of travel costs
* Your own work laptop
* Hybrid working to blend home working for focus and office working for collaboration and co-creation

**Background information**

Within the Machine Control group, we are responsible for orchestrating and synchronizing all high-level behavioral actions. We have a large number of modules working in parallel in a large configuration space. Due to the large scale and complexity of the system, there is a need for an abstracted overview of the system.

  

We need such an overview for multiple reasons. It can be used to improve the overall understanding of the system, and it can be used by experts to quickly diagnose unexpected behavior, considerably reducing investigation time.

  

Currently, the process of creating such an overview is mostly manual and labor-intensive task sometimes assisted by rudimentary tooling. The existing tooling does not support diagnostics enough due to low user-friendliness and missing features.

**Assignment description**

The aim of your project is to take the existing tooling as a starting point, polish and extend it such that it can better facilitate diagnostics of the system behavior. In this assignment you will:

* Gather the needs of the experts;
* Ensure the system stores the data required to generate the overview;
* Streamline the tooling to improve the diagnostic workflow of the user;
* Closely interact with users to iteratively create a polished product.

**Your Profile**
----------------


To be a perfect fit for this assignment, you:

* Have background in Computer Science or related;
* Are a bachelor student looking to do your thesis (bachelor graduation project/thesis), or a master student looking to gain work experience (master apprentice);
* Are able to translate functional requirements and design in to software designs;
* Are experienced in Python (required), and experienced in C and/or C++ is a bonus.
* Have knowledge in diagnostic methods (preferred);


Other requirements you need to meet:

* You are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship;
* You need to be located in the Netherlands to be perform your internship. In case you ‘re currently living/studying outside of the Netherlands, please include in your CV/motivation letter willingness to relocate.

***This position seeks a junior scientific programmer to further develop and integrate existing movici and multi-model.nl platforms and support the development of new (multi-)models of infrastructure interactions. The work will be done in close cooperation with PhDs, postdoc, senior experts on modeling theory and decision-making and practitioners from infrastructure providers. This position can potentially be turned into a PhD postion.***


Job description


Infrastructures provide the basis for many critical societal processes, from economy to education, from healthcare to housing and more. The infrastructures are increasingly interdependent on each other, from providing mutual services (like energy and data for mobility), via to providing alternative capacity (like rail, road and waterways), to competing for the same space (like in urban contexts).



Models and simulations are key tools for decision makers, allowing them to build, design, and plan infrastructures. As the need for integrated, cross system insight rises, current monodisciplinary and mono-sectoral models are increasingly unable to provide the required insights. A promising direction is multi-modelling, where different models and simulations are combined in an ecosystem of tools, that can be used and re-used in different configurations. The model ecosystem, and the socio-technical approach to modelling poses new methodological and technical challenges.



Models are instrumental for supporting the social process of decision-making, and are not a goal in themselves. Key model and software requirements will stem from the users and the social process that they are involved in. You, as a developer will be involved in these processes where needed, but are not expected to organize and manage them.



Work will consist of two main lines, platform development and model development support. Platform development involves integration of existing open-source platforms MOVICI and multi-model.nl, identifying new requirements and features from the users and developing them. Model development includes software implementation and general computing and data analysis support for researchers, modelers and modelling and simulation theorists. You may also be asked for advice on the most suitable software solutions, data structures, architectures, code redesign where necessary.



Goal of the position is the further development of the MOVICI and multi-model.nl platform towards a tailored tool for broad impact analysis in a complex stakeholder environment. The later means a lot of attention for describing and modeling scenario’s, a wide range and flexible approach towards evaluative criteria for these scenario’s, clear visualizations in space and time on scenario development, and interconnection with other modeling platforms.



We are looking for a person who enjoys (re)design and implementation ""done right"", with long term maintainability, reusability and generalizability being important, without losing sight of practicality. Willingness to work closely with domain experts and modeling theorists is paramount. Correct and clean representation and implementation of the relevant concepts is much more important than churning out features quickly. You will be working in research focused academic setting, so affinity with science, scientific methods and processes is useful.


Requirements


The software stack is organised around open source workflows: git, python, docker, Apache Airflow, linux shell and some C++. We also make use of REST interfaces and client-server architectures where relevant. Prior experience with these technologies is desirable but is explicitly not expected. We do expect solid python programming ability, high level of general computing skills and eagerness to learn more, as well as a good command of the English language. Dutch proficiency is desired but not necessary.



This is a junior position, and your interests, willingness to learn and team fit are much more important than prior experience with specific technologies.



We are seeking a recent graduate from a computer science/ computer engineering / programming and/or data science-oriented MSc program, but candidates with different background are also encouraged to apply. The position could in term be changed to a modeling and simulation focused PhD position.



We expect that you will take the initiative, be independent and can handle a high degree of freedom, especially in the technical domain. However, you will not be left alone to “figure it all out by yourself”. You will be part of a team that takes personal development and growth, mental health and neurodiversity seriously. You will be working closely with Dr. Ir. I Nikolic, and Prof. Dr. W. Veeneman.

* A salary based on scale 9 of the CAO for Dutch Universities with a minimum of €3.377,- and a maximum of €4.640,- gross per month based on a fulltime contract (38 hours), plus 8% holiday allowance and an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%.

Then we have an opportunity for you.

  



**Job Description**  

In the plastic packaging value chain, there is only limited information available on the plastics in that chain to assess circularity and recyclability goals, especially the use of post-consumer recyclates (PCR) in packaging.

  


Quality specifications, monitoring, and standardisation of materials are common in certain industries like chemistry and pharma but are, at this point, only in an infancy state in plastic waste management. A major challenge when it comes to mechanical recycling of plastics is that the quality of the material is not monitored throughout the whole process. Inline monitoring is however essential for predicting the final quality of PCR.

  


In the MoQuP-R project, we focus on the necessary quality monitoring tools and the application of existing models related to the prediction of recyclate quality in order to increase the use of PCR in packaging. In this project your responsibilities will entail:


* Review literature to identify potential inline analytical methods to monitor quality parameters.
* Adapt laboratory and/or offline analytical techniques to be used inline in polymer processing equipment.
* Propose and execute design changes to polymer processing equipment to enable inline measurements.
* Design experiments using polymer processing equipment and post-consumer plastics to apply and develop monitoring tools.
* Evaluate the different methods in relation to PCR quality.
* Manage a work package in the MoQuP-R project.
* Present your work at international conferences, MoQuP-R consortium meetings, and other events and write scientific papers for international peer-reviewed journals.
* Provide teaching assistance and/or supervision of researchers and students.

  




As a Postdoctoral Researcher you will work in the Circular Plastics team in the Faculty of Science and Engineering located at Brightlands Chemelot Campus in Geleen. You will become part of a young international research group, specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics with a strong polymer science background. Your will work together with Rudinei Fiorio on this exciting topic.

  


**Requirements**  

We expect you to have the following experience, knowledge, and skills:


* A PhD degree in mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, process analysis, mechatronics, or similar;
* Advanced skills in CAD and interfacing sensor data to analysis software (e.g. Python, Matlab, Simulink);
* Good knowledge on analytical techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, GCMS;
* Skills in polymer processing;
* Experience with industry collaborations is considered advantageous;
* Proficiency in both written and spoken English.

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.
* Masters degree, PhD or equivalent experience in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, etc.).
* We prefer candidates with Deep Learning experience, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. Experience with TensorFlow is a plus.
* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.

Then this is the perfect job for you!
  
Knab was founded in 2012. We are an online bank, but one run by real people. We are known for being different because we want to do things differently. Simpler, smarter, and more affordable for our customers. By combining smart technology with a healthy dose of common sense, we create financial services that meet your needs. We add sublime, personal service to this, creating something unique in the financial sector.  

  

**Your role and responsibilities**  

Are you passionate about problem solving and combining the use of different tools in your daily work? And are you interested in the interest rate risk and enjoy improving processes? As a Senior ALM Specialist you will be responsible for managing and modelling interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) in a small and engaged team.  

  

Furthermore, the role will include at least the following:


* Managing the interest rate risk through hedging and designing optimal risk steering;
* Developing and refining interest rate related models (e.g. non-maturing deposits, cash flows, prepayments, mortgage pipeline, hedge accounting);
* Shaping decision-making, policies and analyses for senior management;
* Reporting the IRRBB and FX position to ALCO;
* Staying up-to-date with the latest changes in regulation (i.e. EBA, BCBS 239) related to IRRBB management;
* Enhancing reporting processes with regard to the automation and quality of the reported data;
* Assisting junior team members in their professional development.


The current interest rate environment and changes in EBA IRRBB regulation make it a very dynamic and exciting time to be part of a first-line of defence ALM team. The combination of the current economic climate, a flat-structured bank and a wide range of projects offer you a great opportunity to grow professionally and develop a holistic view on interest rate risk of the bank.  

  

**The team**  

The Asset and Liability Management & Methodology (ALM&M) team’s goal is to deliver on Knab’s strategy by optimizing the balance sheet of Knab. We do this by ensuring that the interest rate risk and funding positions of Knab are managed within the boundaries set in the strategies for those risks whilst not losing sight of the profitability of the bank.  

  

We believe in assigning ownership instead of tasks and, as a result, everyone within the ALM&M team gets the chance to own and be in the lead of a focus area within our team. This creates a flat structure which enables people to take initiative and develop their professional career on their own terms.  

  

On a personal side, we are a fun and multi-national team of curious and knowledgeable people. We perceive work as a challenge to improve ourselves and the bank. We like to work together and learn from each other through regular knowledge sharing sessions. We also enjoy spending time together outside of the work (e.g. having a drink or a game of padel.  

  

**Your profile**  

To be successful in this role, this is the kind of traits we have in mind:


* Completed masters degree in (Quantitative) Finance, Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics or similar;
* 5-7 years of relevant working experience in financial modelling, ALM or balance sheet management;
* Experience with Python, R, VBA (Excel) or C++ is a must, SQL is a plus;
* Experience with ALM / risk software solutions such as QRM or Ambit Focus is preferred;
* Ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and concise way;
* Self-starter with the ability, agility and motivation for self-learning;
* Excellent control of the English language, both written and verbally. Dutch is a bonus.


Did you know that according to research, women are less likely to apply than men when they don't meet all the job requirements? What a shame. Because, in our view, 'the perfect candidate' is a myth. So, if you have the drive to grow in aspects of this role, we look forward to your application.  

  

**This is Knab and this is what we offer you**  

Come as you are. Knab is an open workplace with positive vibes. We are inclusive of all nationalities, races and genders. We feel comfortable to bring our authentic whole selves to work and like you to do so too.  

  

If you come to work with us, Knab will become a significant part of your life. Therefore, we make sure the ambiance is just as exciting as your job. If you have any questions regarding this role or the process, please feel free to reach out to us.

=====================

* **We are on a mission** to make programming biology easy. We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.
* We're an **experienced team**. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!
* We're focused on building the **best possible team culture**. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.
* We offer **top of the market** salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.


**Responsibilities**:


As a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:

* Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools
* Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations
* Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process
* Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain
* Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.
* Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem

**Need to haves**
=================

* Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills
* You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.
* You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer\*, or even implement a UI plugin.
* You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.
* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**
=================

* Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.
* A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.
* You have worked with databases or big data systems.
* You have designed user interfaces and are familiar with one or more of the popular frameworks.
* You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.
* Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Cradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.**  

  

We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.


You will be joining a high-growth, highly ambitious startup with an experienced founding team, whose motivation is building a more sustainable world using biology. We are backed by some of the most well known investors and industry veterans.

Do you want to help identify how Rabobank can increase its positive impact on nature and reduce its negative impact?

**You and your job**  

As Quantitative Analyst for Biodiversity at RaboResearch you know the secrets of modelling the impact of human activities on nature. This includes combining deep knowledge of top-down models on Nature impact with a good understanding of how bottom-up primary data can be integrated into the picture. You will be part of the team that delivers Rabobank’s first quantitative nature impact report. In addition, as a Quantitative Analyst you create actionable insights on how to implement Rabobank’s Nature vision.

Felix Beckebanze, Quantitative Analyst with a focus on Biodiversity at RaboResearch.

 **The big picture**


Rabobank finances farmers and food supply chain clients around the world. Farming impacts biodiversity, both positively and negatively. How can we quantify the financed impact on nature? Which type of data do we need to do so? And how can we reduce the negative impact and increase the positive impact? Answering these questions is how you share your talent as a Quantitative Analyst at Rabobank.

**We achieve more together than alone**  

We believe in the power of difference. Bringing together people's differences is what makes us an even better bank. So we are very curious about what you can bring to our team at RaboResearch.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

The sub-team focusing on ESG Data has been active for almost a year. As a member of this team, the goal is to collaboratively build an ESG Data platform with IT Developers to supply the team involved in Sustainable Finance Regulation Modelling with the necessary data to monitor ESG risk.  

  

Given the significance that regulatory authorities attribute to modelling and the underlying data, this role is challenging and impactful.

* Gap analysis of the data requirements for the SFR regulation and the data already available on the platform;
* Planning of the delivery of the required data;
* Actual delivery of dataset to the consumers.


  

Once the platform is ready, you will be involved in the data collection process. Your duties will encompass technical aspects such as SQL and Python programming, performing Data Quality analyses, and integrating datasets. Simultaneously, you'll be working on documentation and utilizing your communicative skills for stakeholder alignment. Active participation in frequent team meetings, where knowledge-sharing and progress transparency are key, is also expected.

* Make an inventory of the relevant databases within the bank and gain access to them;
* Combine tables (merge / link) and aggregate data in SQL and Python;
* Apply Data Quality Analysis, for example, course over time, missing values, extreme values;
* Investigate the plausibility of the new data;
* Document the data sourcing process and descriptive statistics and discuss this with the business parties;
* Additionally, there are many ad hoc activities, and you will regularly participate in cross-departmental projects. Your ability and willingness to collaborate are crucial for success in this role. You naturally take initiative, organize work effectively, and eagerly work with others to deliver tangible results. You possess a practical, analytical approach and strong communication and presentation skills. Being a robust team player, you take responsibility for your work.

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=0c48e3966dd23e85,indeed,Site Reliability Engineer (DevOps),Vattenfall,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Vattenfall,"Amsterdam, NH, NL",fulltime,2024-07-23,,,,,False,,,ewa.krajewska@vattenfall.com,"**Over de functie**
-------------------

 **Do you want to commit to a critical challenge and help to shape our future?**


We keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages, and configuration errors.


We are looking for a team member who is driven by technical challenges and the urge to always find better and more efficient ways of delivering services to the customer.  

  

**What will you do?**


In the role as SRE engineer you will combine the skillset of dev teams and operations teams by applying a software engineering approach to IT operations.


To succeed in this role it is important that you are self-driven, exact, analytic, critical and know how to prioritize. You are not only an expert in your field but you also have social competence and understand the business needs. You always challenge yourself and others to improve. You are also open for suggestions from others and can also give your own.


You are a team player and have a hands-on mindset, a strong customer- and problem-solving orientation. You show fast results, and you have demonstrated good communication skills, especially in an international organization. You need to be able to work independently in an international team that meets more virtually than physically.

  

  

**Your tasks and responsibilities:**

**Maintaining Applications to Help Operations and Support Teams**


As a SRE you are in charge of proactively implementing and maintaining infrastructure and business applications. This can be anything from provisioning servers, updating systems, deploying new software, providing pre-emptive maintenance to monitoring and alerting to code changes in production. A site reliability engineer can be tasked with building a homegrown tool from scratch to help with weaknesses in software delivery or incident management.


You must always be looking to improve quality and efficiency and cut costs.

**Fixing Support Escalation Issues**


Similarly to the point above, a site reliability engineer can be expected to spend time fixing support escalation cases.

**Optimizing On-Call Rotations and Processes**


More times than not, site reliability engineers will need to take on-call responsibilities and improve system reliability through the optimization of on-call processes. You will help add automation and context to alerts – leading to better real-time collaborative response from on-call responders. Additionally, you will update runbooks, tools and documentation to help prepare your on-call team members for future incidents.

**Documenting “Tribal” K****nowledge**


As you gain exposure to systems in both staging and production, as well as all technical teams, you will take part in work with software development, support, IT operations and on-call duties – meaning you will build up a great amount of historical knowledge over time. Instead of keeping this knowledge in the mind of one team or one person, as SRE you are expected to document much of what you know. Constant upkeep of documentation and runbooks can ensure teams get the information they need right when they need it.

**Conducting Post-Incident Reviews**


Without thorough post-incident reviews, you have no way to identify what’s working and what’s not. As such you will be participating in post-incident reviews, documenting your findings and taking action on your learnings.


Maybe also add \""provision new servers\""... it is attractive to have a more technical approach to woo away developers and coordinators!

 **Location**  

  

Katowice, Gliwice, Amsterdam or Solna

**Jouw profiel**
----------------

 **Who are you?**  

  

As our Site Reliability Engineer you:

* Are an expert in your field, strong technical and analytical skills, can solve impossible problems.
* Have the ability to translate complicated technical matters into simple understandable language.
* Have experience in building and operating of server virtualization environments.
* Have thorough knowledge of operating systems (Linux/Windows 2019 and up).
* Work with Agile methodology.
* Have experience in troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
* Are able to deal with tight deadlines when they arise.
* Have automation experience with at least one configuration/deployment management system (Ansible, Jenkins pipelines, Azure DevOps…).
* Have experience with at least one of the following scripting languages (Powershell, Shell, Python…).
* Have experience working with GIT.
* Have experience developing CI/CD.

  

Next to this you bring:

* Experience in a large international environment is desirable.
* Experience with containers is a plus.

**Strategic Leadership:** Responsibilities include leading the strategic direction of the team's engagements and collaborating with stakeholders. While not directly involved in software delivery, the role necessitates a profound understanding of technical architecture, potential challenges, and aligning the team's work with broader organisational goals.

 **Qualities we look for**

* Significant experience in leading Developer Experience roles, focusing on improving DORA metrics
* Leading leaders: The team currently has two engineering managers who will report to you

* Experience with a wide range of observability practices (SLOs, Dashboards, Alerts,..) for business-critical systems

 **What we offer**

* **Diverse and internationally distributed team**: joining our team means becoming part of a large, global community with people of more than 90 nationalities. We're more than just colleagues; we're a group of professionals with a shared mission to connect diverse cultures. Our global presence is growing–we've doubled in size nearly every year, with our employees based in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the US, and Japan, and we continue to expand our network.


* **Open communication, regular feedback**: as a language-focused company, we value the importance of clear, honest communication. We value smooth collaboration, direct and actionable feedback, and believe that leading with empathy makes us better together.


* **Remote work, flexible hours**: whether you're near or in our hubs in cities like Cologne, Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Austin, or Tokyo, or prefer the comfort of your own home, you decide where your office is. We offer remote opportunities, flexible working hours and trust in your productivity, all in sync with your team's general locations and time zones to foster effective and seamless collaboration. Our aim is to integrate your work with your lifestyle, ensuring a balance that respects both your needs and our operational requirements.


* **Regular in-person team events**: we bond over vibrant events that are as unique as our team, from local team and business unit gatherings, to new-joiner onboardings and company-wide events that bring us all together–literally.


* **Monthly full-day hacking sessions**: every month, we have Hack Fridays, where you can spend your time diving into a project you're passionate about and get the opportunity to work with other teams–we value your initiatives, impact, and creativity.


* **Comprehensive health insurance**: your health comes first. With our comprehensive insurance, we'll make sure you're covered from head to toe.


* **30 days of annual leave**: we value your peace of mind. With up to 30 days off (excluding public holidays) and access to mental health resources, we make sure you're as strong mentally as you are professionally.
* **Annual learning budget**: because we never stop learning, we’ve set up an annual budget for your professional development—pick a learning path which contributes to your career development and we'll back you up.

At DeepL, it's about the value you bring and the growth we can foster together. Go ahead, apply—let's discover your potential together. We can't wait to meet you!**

* Apply Data Quality Analysis, for example, course over time, missing values, extreme values;
* Investigate the plausibility of the new data;
* Document the data sourcing process and descriptive statistics and discuss this with the business parties;
* Additionally, there are many ad hoc activities, and you will regularly participate in cross-departmental projects. Your ability and willingness to collaborate are crucial for success in this role. You naturally take initiative, organize work effectively, and eagerly work with others to deliver tangible results. You possess a practical, analytical approach and strong communication and presentation skills. Being a robust team player, you take responsibility for your work.

 ***We do it right:*** When you’re moving fast it can be tempting to constantly cut corners to things done. But this results in a product that is a struggle to work with and has unhappy users. We make that extra effort to be proud of what we’re building; understand the problem we’re solving, write one more test or tackle technical debt.

 ***We are empowered to act, challenge and lead:*** To work effectively as a team everyone must have a voice and feel they can stand up and be counted. As a software engineer at Returnista we want you to feel empowered. That could mean proposing new ideas, fixing things without seeking permission or challenging the CEO.

 ***We are intrepid:*** We want our engineers to show initiative and to innovate. Intrepid Friday’s give us the opportunity to work on things that might not ostensibly be the highest priority, but can make a big difference to our product or how we work.

* Contribute towards the drafting of key findings, research reports and articles.
* Suggest ways to improve methodologies, scoring guidelines, research workflows, and analytical techniques.

* At least three years of professional research experience in relevant fields.

**What are you going to do**  

The Postdoc will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.  

The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and one Postdoc, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).

Wij maken van Albert Heijn het beste omnichannel Food & Tech bedrijf en willen digitaal gemak voor iedereen. We testen en experimenteren, zijn innovatief en verleggen grenzen. Voor die reis hebben wij het Data Talent Track. Een track waarin wij jouw carrière als Data Analyst bij Albert Heijn een vliegende start geven binnen onze Digital Analytics afdeling. Is dit echt iets voor jou? Word dan de nieuwe Data Analyst in ons Data Talent Track!

  

  

**Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst ken jij onze klant het beste. Deze kennis verkrijg je door gebruik te maken van data (zoals bijvoorbeeld data over koopgedrag), om zo de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van data-oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk met de nieuwste data analytics technieken. Je maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Analytics & Data Science team, en bent daarmee onderdeel van de grotere Analytics community binnen Albert Heijn. Je beweegt makkelijk tussen Tech, Data Science en de business teams, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data analytics toepassingen. Je maakt impact als Data Analist door:

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

  



**Dit doe je als Data Analyst Digital**

Het Digital domein richt zich op digitale relevantie, experimentation, eCommerce en klantloyaliteit. Hiervoor voeren we data-analyses uit of ontwikkelen wij dataproducten om onze e-commerce en Digital-afdelingen te ondersteunen met inzichten rondom onze klanten, het verbeteren van e-commerce en het verbeteren van de customer journey. Denk daarbij aan projecten zoals het relevanter maken van onze aanbiedingen (Mijn Bonus Box) of marketing, inzichtelijk maken van de omnichannel customer journeys en het analyseren van onze spaarprogramma’s.

  



**Jouw ontwikkeling in het Data Talent Track**


Het Data Talent Track is een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen die je helpen om jouw professionele vaardigheden te ontwikkelen. Zo zijn er trainingen zoals persoonlijk leiderschap en het efficiënter schrijven van code, maar ga je bijvoorbeeld ook een dagje meehelpen in de winkel of bouw je mee aan de ideeën van de toekomst in een Hackathon. Wil je meer weten over hoe het Data Talent Track eruitziet? Neem dan vooral ook eens een kijkje hier.

 **Dit breng je mee**


Als grootste supermarkt van Nederland vullen we met meer dan 100.000 medewerkers dagelijks zo'n 5 miljoen borden. En als het aan ons ligt, doen we dat binnenkort ook samen met jou als onze Data Analyst. Zeker als je de broodnodige pro-activiteit en resultaatgerichtheid naar Albert Heijn meebrengt. Jij bent gedreven, staat sterk in je schoen en de ambitie spat van je af. Ook heb je:

* Een afgeronde wo-opleiding met data- en/of statistische basis zoals Econometrie, Operations Research, Wiskunde, Informatica, Business Analytics of Marketing Intelligence
* Ervaring met werken met grote databases (Python / PySpark / R / SQL)
* Ervaring met het oplossen van business vraagstukken met data analytics en/of Data Science technieken d.m.v. Python / R
* Ervaring met visualisatie tools zoals Tableau of Power BI is een pré


En, niet onbelangrijk, ben je:

* Proactief; je geeft zowel gevraagd als ongevraagd advies
* Sterk in het adviseren van de business en meenemen van stakeholders
* Communicatief sterk; je weet complexe informatie aan een niet-technisch publiek uit te leggen

 **De beste ingrediënten voor een betekenisvolle baan**

* Een salaris van max € 4000,- per periode van 4 weken (afhankelijk van je ervaring)
* Een winstuitkering oplopend van 45 tot 130% van je gemiddelde periodesalaris

We sparen samen voor een heel goed pensioen. En wij betalen ruim 5 keer zo veel als jij. Zo ben je ook later verzekerd van een goed inkomen* Je kunt 45 (ja, vijfenveertig) dagen vrij nemen; 25,5 vaste vakantiedagen en 19,5 ADV dagen. Veel plezier!
* Je ontwikkelt je even snel als de tech waar we mee werken. Dankzij feedback loops met de best & the brightest tech savvy collega’s. En door actief bij te dragen aan de AH Technology community – plons in een zee aan kennis en inzichten!
* Een moderne laptop en smartphone zijn ‘inbegrepen’. Bovendien hamster je kortingen. Op verzekeringen en je boodschappen bijvoorbeeld
* Je neemt deel aan het Data Talent track, een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen, en daarnaast heb je ook toegang tot onze AH Data Academy met nog veel meer trainingen zowel op hard- als soft skills. Jou een vliegende kickstart geven en de kans om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen vinden wij namelijk erg belangrijk
* Een werkgever die het beste van twee werelden combineert: de kansen die je met een corporate associeert plus de autonomie en de “to boldly go where no person has gone before” drive die scale-ups kenmerkt
* De kans om miljoenen mensen gezonder, lekkerder en makkelijker te laten eten

 **Solliciteer**


Klik op de sollicitatiebutton en ontdek hoe je dat, samen met enorm diverse én enorm enthousiaste collega’s, werkelijkheid maakt. We willen je daarbij vragen om geen standaard motivatiebrief te sturen, maar een antwoord te formuleren op de volgende vragen:

* Waarom zou je bij Albert Heijn willen werken?

**What will you be doing?**
Historically-collected, long-term datasets are some of the most valuable assets in ecology and environmental science. Their preservation is of paramount importance, especially in light of ongoing environmental change. Yet many such datasets remain effectively inaccessible because they are not publicly shared or, more concerningly, only exist in non-digital or obsolete formats. The urgency of these issues increases with the age of the data. Indeed, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and Open data biodiversity data from prior to the mid-20th century or exceedingly rare.; further reason to preserve those data that do exist.  


This position forms part of the *NESKAST 1.0* project, with funding provided by the Netherlands Biodiversity Information Facility (NLBIF). In this project, we seek to apply best practices in data management to digitise and FAIRify historical (1922 - 1950) data on the breeding ecology of hole-nesting birds, which are currently stored as paper ledgers in the archives of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW). The data, spanning a nearly 30-year time period in the early professionalisation of ecology and biodiversity monitoring, were rigorously collected and stored by amateur naturalists. The data are especially valuable given their duration and coverage of a time period that is not well-represented by existing long-term studies.In particular, these data, in combination with those from the long-term nest box studies conducted by NIOO-KNAW and its predecessors since 1955, will extend our ability to understand how recent environmental change is impacting the ecology and population persistence of wild birds.  


In this short-term position, the prospective applicant will focus on three primary tasks:
* Digitisation of the historical nest box data — automated data extraction, manual data entry and cross-checking


* FAIRification of the data — generate metadata, apply standard data vocabularies, and map tabular data


* Prepare outreach materials — summarise project results for presentation to NESTKAST 2.0 community
  


**What will you be contributing?**
As part of a team working on data rescue and FAIRification, you will apply your knowledge and skills to digitise and archive the historical data described above. You will develop and implement a script for automated data extraction using script-based approaches in R (or other relevant languages), wrangling the extracted data into tidy, tabular data frames, and evaluating and correcting errors in the compiled datasets. Subsequent work will include the extraction of relevant metadata from the legders, creation of a data dictionary, and application of common data standards to ensure the data meeting FAIR practices. This work will be carried out in close collaboration with team members well-versed in these standards and their application to ecological data, and researchers actively collecting similar data from our long-term studies. You will be involved in preparing a summary presentation on the outcomes of this initiative.  


**Desired qualifications, skills and competences:**
* Basic experience with script-based data wrangling, standarisation, and visualisation, with a preference for the R programming language
* Experience with or knowledge of automated processes for extraction of tabular data from PDF scans of hand-written documents
* Experience with data validation, including assertative programming techniques
* Basic knowledge of or strong interest in data standards and metadata schema relevant in ecology and related disciplines (e.g., DarwinCore, Ecological Metadata Language)
* Strong interest in Open and FAIR research practices, and transparent and reproducible science
* Profiency in English, both written and verbal

  


**What are we offering?**
This technical/research support position will be hosted in the Department of Animal Ecology at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) in Wageningen. The work will be carried out in collaboration with research personnel in the Department spearheading efforts in data rescue and FAIRification, and will link closely with the LTER-LIFE large-scale infrastructure project hosted at the Institute. The employee will work in a vibrant research group and have the opportunity to create strong links with collaborators and partners involved in national Open and FAIR Science initiatives.

**De afdeling -** ***Directie Grote Ondernemingen***  

De Directie Grote Ondernemingen (GO) is verantwoordelijk voor de fiscale behandeling van de ongeveer 9.000 grootste ondernemingen en non-profit organisaties in Nederland. Daarnaast behandelt GO een aantal dossiers van zeer vermogende personen en voeren we een aantal zeer uiteenlopende specialistische taken uit zoals de kansspelbelasting en constructiebestrijding. Onze klanten vertegenwoordigen zo’n 75% van de belastinginkomsten van de rijksoverheid. Ook genereren zij veel informatie die de overheid gebruikt voor bijvoorbeeld toeslagen of studiefinanciering.


De uitvoerings- en toezichtstrategie van GO is gericht op bereidwillige naleving van wet- en regelgeving door deze organisaties. Zij kenmerken zich door relatief grote financiële belangen en complexere fiscale vraagstukken. In het geval van multinationals komt daar nog een component bij in de vorm van internationale wet- en regelgeving en samenwerking met buitenlandse belastingdiensten.


Om er voor te zorgen dat de belastingafdracht van deze organisaties soepel blijft lopen werkt GO met behandelteams. In deze teams wordt kennis over de specifieke branche, de individuele ondernemingen en kennis van de verschillende belastingmiddelen samengebracht.


Zo werkt GO aan een zo efficiënt en effectief mogelijk proces voor het heffen, controleren en innen van de belastingen bij de grootste ondernemingen en non profit organisaties en zo dragen we bij aan een financieel gezond Nederland.

**Faculteit/Dienst:** Faculteit der Maatschappij- & Gedragswetenschappen
**Opleidingsniveau:** Master
**Functie type:** Promotieplaats
**Sluitingsdatum:** 23 September 2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13280
*Are you passionate about advancing our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying social media's impact on youth?*
*Is it your ambition to be a part of an international team of researchers?**Are you enthusiastic about multi-method approaches that combine computational modeling, experience sampling, social media data donation and questionnaires with intervention-, experimental- and neuroimaging- studies?*  

*We would like to get to know you!*  

*The Connected Minds Lab* *at the department of Developmental Psychology is looking two PhD Candidates who are interested in joining our team.*  


**What are you going to do**  

The PhD canidates will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.
The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and two Postdocs, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).  

**What are you going to do**  


As a part of this team consisting of national and international researchers, and societal partners, you will play a central role in one of the work packages of this project. You will work on a wide array of research tasks, that include designing and performing empirical studies, and co-supervising RA’s working on the project.
Your tasks as a PhD within this ERC Consolidator project will include the following:
* Recruiting teens, students, parents for your studies;
* Draft pre-registrations and submit ethics reviews.
* Conduct data-analysis and prepare results for publications;
* Draft articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals;
* Contribute to the Connected Minds Lab and the wider scientific community through collaborations, workshops, presentations/talks, attending conferences.

  


**What do you have to offer**  


We are looking for a dedicated candidate who is eager to conduct basic/fundamental research on the psychological mechanisms underlying social media engagement and who is excited about making societal contributions. The candidate must thrive in a collaborative environment that calls for autonomy, creativity, and commitment. Given the quantitative focus of the projects an affinity with computational modeling and programming is recommended.  

***Your experience and profile***
* You hold a master’s degree in psychology, pedagogics, sociology, educational science, or an associated field. If you completed your master’s degree in the Netherlands, we have a preference for a research master, although this is not a requirement;
* You have strong interest in quantitative research;
* You are motivated to design and conduct your own quantitative research;
* You have excellent quantitative data-analysis skills or you are interested in acquiring these skills;
* Affinity with Open Science (pre-registrations, sharing data etc.);
* Experience with R or Python
* You have excellent writing and presentation skills in English;
* You enjoy working in a team of ambitious researchers.

  

  

Because the project involves intensive data collection with youth, sometimes at schools, mastering the Dutch language is an advantage. Please note that this is **not** a requirement, because excellent candidates who do not speak Dutch may be able to collect data with the assistance of Dutch-speaking students.  

**What can we offer you**  


* A position in which initiative and input are highly valued;
* An enthusiastic and warm team that is open to new colleagues;
* An inspiring academic and international working environment, in the heart of Amsterdam.

  


The position concerns employment of 38 hours per week for 4 years (or 30,4 hours for approximately 5 years). The initial employment is for one year. Following a positive assessment and barring altered circumstances this term will be extended, which should result in the conferral of a doctorate. Together with you, your supervisors will put together a curriculum that will also include the opportunity to attend training courses and both national and international events. You will also have the opportunity to teach bachelor’s and master’s students.  

Your salary will be €2.770 gross per month in the first year and will increase to €3.539 in the final year, based on full-time employment (38 hours per week) and in keeping with the Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities. We additionally offer an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%  


The UvA offers excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.  


**About us**  

The University of Amsterdam is the largest university in the Netherlands, with the broadest spectrum of degree programmes. It is an intellectual hub with 39,000 students, 6,000 employees and 3,000 doctoral students who are all committed to a culture of inquiring minds.  

***About the faculty***
A challenging work environment with a variety of duties and ample scope for individual initiative and development within an inspiring organization. The social and behavioral sciences play a leading role in addressing the major societal challenges faced by the world, the Netherlands and Amsterdam, now and in the future.

*Are you passionate about advancing our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying social media's impact on youth?*
*Is it your ambition to be a part of an international team of researchers?**Are you enthusiastic about multi-method approaches that combine computational modeling, experience sampling, social media data donation and questionnaires with intervention-, experimental- and neuroimaging- studies?*  

*We would like to get to know you!*  


*The Connected Minds Lab* *at the department of Developmental Psychology is looking a Postdoctoral Researcher who is interested in joining our team.*  

**What are you going to do**  

The Postdoc will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.  

The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and one Postdoc, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).  

  

**What are you going to do**

* Supervise RA’s and PhD’s working on the project;
* Draft pre-registrations and submit ethics reviews.
* Conduct data-analysis and prepare results for publications;
* Draft articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals;

Contribute to the Connected Minds Lab and the wider scientific community through collaborations, workshops, presentations/talks, attending conferences.  
* 

**What do you have to offer**  

You are a conscientious and collaborative researcher who prefers to work in a team and has an affinity with computational modeling and programming.

* Affinity with Open Science (pre-registrations, sharing data etc.);
* Independence, but also a strong capacity for teamwork;
* Full professional working proficiency in English (speaking, writing, reading).

---------------------------------------



In deze rol ga je werken voor de afdeling Zorggerelateerde Infecties en Antimicrobiële resistentie (ZIA). De afdeling ZIA is verantwoordelijk voor de surveillance en epidemiologisch onderzoek van zorg-gerelateerde infecties en antimicrobiële resistentie in Nederland.

Doordat je werkt binnen het Centrum Epidemiologie en Surveillance van Infectieziekten leer je veel over epidemiologische methoden en onderzoeken, ook buiten jouw aandachtsgebied. Er is ook ruimte en aandacht voor vakinhoudelijke ontwikkeling d.m.v. cursus en congres bezoek, maar ook op het gebied van zelfontwikkeling is er binnen het RIVM een uitgebreid cursusaanbod. Naast de werkdagen op kantoor (minimaal 2 dagen per week) is er ook ruimte om vanuit huis te werken en zo de privé-werk balans optimaal in te richten.

This PhD position is about the continuous visual guidance of locomotor behavior in team sports. In this project, you will develop and test ecological models of how athletes (decide to) act upon moving targets. Existing models typically dissociate decision making and motor control. Either focusing on the information that is needed to perceive relevant action possibilities (known as affordances) or focusing on the information that is needed to control behavior (known as control laws).



In a recent modelling study on the kinematics of catching in baseball, we found that the information that guides the control of action might actually be the same information that also informs decision making. This unification of information challenges traditional models of control in perception-action research. With this PhD project, we aim to extend our model to include all interceptive behaviors in sports, such as tackling / evading an opponent or running to receive a pass.



In this position, you will collect kinematic data that allows you to make inferences on the perceptual information that is used to guide interceptive behaviors in sports. Data may be collected using sensor platforms such as XSens Link; OptiTrack; JohanSports GPS tracking; and Tobii eye tracking. You will also work with – and build on – Virtual Reality setups that allow you to investigate interceptive behaviors in a range of sport specific scenarios. You will perform high quality and internationally visible research that gets published at top tier conferences and journals.

* You have experience in collecting, processing, and analyzing biomechanical / biodynamical / kinematic data.
* You have good scientific programming skills for example in MATLAB, Python, and R statistics. Experience with Unity is a plus.
* You are proficient in English for communication, both in writing and oral

Jij draagt daar ook je steentje aan bij.
Dit is je team


Bigdata


Miljoenen persoonsgegevens uit de Basisregistratie Personen zijn bij ons in veilige handen.

To empower this movement, we publish free and public corporate benchmarks on systemic issues related to sustainable development. We assess and engage with 2,000 companies across seven system transformations: digital, food and agriculture, nature and biodiversity, decarbonisation and energy, finance, social, and urban, and we collaborate with more than 350 Allies worldwide to facilitate the use of our research insights for stakeholder action.

  



In the coming year, we will be working towards the publication of all our corporate benchmarks: climate and energy, food and agriculture, finance, digital inclusion, human rights, gender, social, nature, and urban. We are seeking to scale up and strengthen our research on how companies perform on a range of sustainable development topics and are therefore looking to grow our research team.

  



We have several openings for the role of “Sustainability Research Analyst”. In this role, you will undertake research, from data collection to analysis, to shed light on how companies are contributing to the positive system changes needed to achieve the 17 United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. You will be objectively assessing companies to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement. You should thrive in a fast-paced and purpose-driven work environment that provides high levels of autonomy.

  


**What you will do:**


* Accurately and objectively assess company performance on sustainable development by applying several WBA benchmark methodologies and scoring guidelines on publicly available information. This could involve undertaking initial data collection from corporate disclosures and public databases and/or reviewing the initial data collected by external research partners.
* Draft company scorecards that provide clear insights into a company’s leading practices as well as risks and opportunities.
* Communicate and engage with benchmarked companies to ensure they understand the relevant methodologies, provide feedback or additional information, share their experiences on how benchmarking influences positive changes at the company level, and participate in peer learning activities and other relevant WBA convenings.
* Participate in the team’s effort towards data cleaning, data management, data analysis, and data visualization.
* Contribute towards the drafting of key findings, research reports and articles.
* Suggest ways to improve methodologies, scoring guidelines, research workflows, and analytical techniques.
* When required, undertake additional data collection and analysis to support the development of more nuanced and contextualized insights on corporate performance.
* Cooperate with your team to deliver accurate research outputs in a timely manner.
* Continually upskill on research methods and tools while enhancing your understanding of relevant industry trends and policy environments.

  


**What we are looking for:**


* At least three years of professional research experience in relevant fields. For this recruitment round, we are especially interested in candidates who are knowledgeable on the topics of human rights issues, or candidates with training and experience relevant to biodiversity, nature and ocean topics or the financial sector, or the food and agriculture sector.
* Strong academic qualifications and research skills, or equivalent hands-on experience. A relevant research PhD is an advantage and counts towards years of professional experience.
* Strong verbal and written English communication skills; able to write clearly and concisely for professional audiences. Additional language skills are a plus.
* Solid grasp of applied statistics and data analysis as well as familiarity with database querying and spreadsheets. Ability to script in R or Python is a plus.
* Data visualization and graphical design skills are a plus.
* Strong interest in research, especially on corporate performance on sustainable development and the business and policy environments that shape that performance.
* Passion for making a difference with a curious mindset and a ‘can do’, hands-on and professional attitude.
* Potential to thrive in a teal culture based on self-managed teams, able to take initiative, self-reflect and collaborate with colleagues.
* Comfortable in a globally inclusive, multi-cultural, fast-paced, agile, and virtual/hybrid environment that promotes flexibility whilst being able to meet deadlines.

  


**Our offer:**



We stimulate personal growth and believe in flexible working arrangements, and you will receive market-based employment benefits (the equivalent of the all-in annual compensation range of €44k - €49k gross). We have a physical presence in Amsterdam and London, alongside many employees who work across the world. You can be based anywhere for this role as inclusivity is one of our values.

Worldwide, over 30 million people with diabetes are insulin dependent. This means they need insulin to manage their blood glucose levels. They can either give themselves multiple daily injections, or use an insulin pump, which administers insulin on a continuous basis around the clock.

  



At ViCentra, we’re on a mission to design an insulin pump that delivers not just a best-in-class performance, but also gives our users an experience that empowers and excites them. Something a bit different from the usual medical experience!

  



It’s simple really: people with diabetes are people – not patients.

  



Our philosophy is all about simplicity, helping to carry some of the weight of day-to-day diabetes management for the user, adding a splash of colour and a whole lot of freedom! Kaleido is one of the smallest insulin pumps in the world. We have 10 colour combinations, from bright and joyful to sleek and chic. We want our users to wear their Kaleido proudly. Its size makes Kaleido discreet and easy to wear, so Kaleidoers can forget about diabetes (for a while, at least!) and focus on what truly matters - living life on their own terms!

  



ViCentra was founded in 2013 in the Netherlands, and while we still call Utrecht our home, we’ve now branched out to France and Germany, too. We're gearing up to spread our magic even further, with concrete plans to extend across Europe in 2024. We are CE marked, with in-house development and manufacturing, a state-of-the-art HQ, and a diverse and energetic team hailing from over 30 countries worldwide! We’re backed by heavyweight investors like EQT, INKEF, and Invest-NL, all helping us to launch our rocket ship journey and forge a steady course.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Wij maken van Albert Heijn het beste omnichannel Food & Tech bedrijf en willen digitaal gemak voor iedereen. We testen en experimenteren, zijn innovatief en verleggen grenzen. Voor die reis hebben wij het Data Talent Track. Een track waarin wij jouw carrière als Data Analyst bij Albert Heijn een vliegende start geven binnen onze Digital Analytics afdeling. Is dit echt iets voor jou? Word dan de nieuwe Data Analyst in ons Data Talent Track!

  

  

**Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst ken jij onze klant het beste. Deze kennis verkrijg je door gebruik te maken van data (zoals bijvoorbeeld data over koopgedrag), om zo de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van data-oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk met de nieuwste data analytics technieken. Je maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Analytics & Data Science team, en bent daarmee onderdeel van de grotere Analytics community binnen Albert Heijn. Je beweegt makkelijk tussen Tech, Data Science en de business teams, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data analytics toepassingen. Je maakt impact als Data Analist door:

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

  



**Dit doe je als Data Analyst Digital**

Het Digital domein richt zich op digitale relevantie, experimentation, eCommerce en klantloyaliteit. Hiervoor voeren we data-analyses uit of ontwikkelen wij dataproducten om onze e-commerce en Digital-afdelingen te ondersteunen met inzichten rondom onze klanten, het verbeteren van e-commerce en het verbeteren van de customer journey. Denk daarbij aan projecten zoals het relevanter maken van onze aanbiedingen (Mijn Bonus Box) of marketing, inzichtelijk maken van de omnichannel customer journeys en het analyseren van onze spaarprogramma’s.

  



**Jouw ontwikkeling in het Data Talent Track**


Het Data Talent Track is een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen die je helpen om jouw professionele vaardigheden te ontwikkelen. Zo zijn er trainingen zoals persoonlijk leiderschap en het efficiënter schrijven van code, maar ga je bijvoorbeeld ook een dagje meehelpen in de winkel of bouw je mee aan de ideeën van de toekomst in een Hackathon. Wil je meer weten over hoe het Data Talent Track eruitziet? Neem dan vooral ook eens een kijkje hier.

 **Dit breng je mee**


Als grootste supermarkt van Nederland vullen we met meer dan 100.000 medewerkers dagelijks zo'n 5 miljoen borden. En als het aan ons ligt, doen we dat binnenkort ook samen met jou als onze Data Analyst. Zeker als je de broodnodige pro-activiteit en resultaatgerichtheid naar Albert Heijn meebrengt. Jij bent gedreven, staat sterk in je schoen en de ambitie spat van je af. Ook heb je:

* Een afgeronde wo-opleiding met data- en/of statistische basis zoals Econometrie, Operations Research, Wiskunde, Informatica, Business Analytics of Marketing Intelligence
* Ervaring met werken met grote databases (Python / PySpark / R / SQL)
* Ervaring met het oplossen van business vraagstukken met data analytics en/of Data Science technieken d.m.v. Python / R
* Ervaring met visualisatie tools zoals Tableau of Power BI is een pré


En, niet onbelangrijk, ben je:

* Proactief; je geeft zowel gevraagd als ongevraagd advies
* Sterk in het adviseren van de business en meenemen van stakeholders
* Communicatief sterk; je weet complexe informatie aan een niet-technisch publiek uit te leggen

 **De beste ingrediënten voor een betekenisvolle baan**

* Een salaris van max € 4000,- per periode van 4 weken (afhankelijk van je ervaring)
* Een winstuitkering oplopend van 45 tot 130% van je gemiddelde periodesalaris

We sparen samen voor een heel goed pensioen. En wij betalen ruim 5 keer zo veel als jij. Zo ben je ook later verzekerd van een goed inkomen* Je kunt 45 (ja, vijfenveertig) dagen vrij nemen; 25,5 vaste vakantiedagen en 19,5 ADV dagen. Veel plezier!
* Je ontwikkelt je even snel als de tech waar we mee werken. Dankzij feedback loops met de best & the brightest tech savvy collega’s. En door actief bij te dragen aan de AH Technology community – plons in een zee aan kennis en inzichten!
* Een moderne laptop en smartphone zijn ‘inbegrepen’. Bovendien hamster je kortingen. Op verzekeringen en je boodschappen bijvoorbeeld
* Je neemt deel aan het Data Talent track, een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen, en daarnaast heb je ook toegang tot onze AH Data Academy met nog veel meer trainingen zowel op hard- als soft skills. Jou een vliegende kickstart geven en de kans om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen vinden wij namelijk erg belangrijk
* Een werkgever die het beste van twee werelden combineert: de kansen die je met een corporate associeert plus de autonomie en de “to boldly go where no person has gone before” drive die scale-ups kenmerkt
* De kans om miljoenen mensen gezonder, lekkerder en makkelijker te laten eten

 **Solliciteer**


Klik op de sollicitatiebutton en ontdek hoe je dat, samen met enorm diverse én enorm enthousiaste collega’s, werkelijkheid maakt. We willen je daarbij vragen om geen standaard motivatiebrief te sturen, maar een antwoord te formuleren op de volgende vragen:

* Waarom zou je bij Albert Heijn willen werken?
* Waarom zou je graag bij Digital Analytics willen werken?
* Waarom denk jij dat je succesvol gaat zijn in deze functie? Vermijd woorden die in deze vacaturetekst staan en houd het persoonlijk
* Als je één sterk en één persoonlijk verbeterpunt mag noemen, welke zouden dit dan zijn?
* Welke programmeer ervaring (Python, SQL, R, etc.) heb je al?

Dit team bestaat uit diverse functies namelijk; een product owner, (online) marketeerverenigingsadviseur en twee webredacteuren. Het team is gericht op alle individuele leden/klanten van VvAA.) Binnen het team richt de data analist zich bijvoorbeeld op klantcontact, waarbij de jij als data analist het proces meet als er een mail naar de klant uitgaat: hoe vaak word de mail geopend, hoe vaak wordt er op de link geklikt, etc.. Vervolgens kan je advies geven aan de hand van de verkregen data voor eventuele toekomstige verbeteringen.  

Alle agile-teams werken aan één doel in sprints van twee weken en juist de grensoverschrijdende samenwerking maakt het werk uitdagender. Zo krijg jij als data analist je eigen focusgebied waarin je aan diverse datavraagstukken werkt.

**Dit is wat je nodig hebt**



Wij willen innoveren op het gebied van data en daarbij is het belangrijk dat jij jouw kennis en ervaring met enthousiasme weet over te brengen op je VvAA-collega’s.

**Why?**

Every swipe, every like, every TikTok video we upload, every Zoom call we have, every Netflix video we watch, or everything we buy online is all processed and depends on… data centers. However, these data centers consume large amounts of energy due to the underlying technology we use every day all day.

**How?**

We have developed an AI-based analytics platform that captures the entire data center (DC) infrastructure—""from roof to room""—to bring the whole DC into a more optimal state. This platform saves energy, water, and scope 3 emissions while increasing reliability and sustainability in data centers across countries like Germany, France, the UK, Australia, and The Netherlands.

We seek a highly qualified **Data Science Lead** with extensive experience in setting up and scaling machine learning infrastructure, processes and teams.

Your outstanding and in-depth knowledge of (the latest) ML/ AI architectures and techniques allows you to make trade-offs in applying effective models to our data center optimization platform.

**Additionally you will**

* Be able to perform hands-on model development and deployment activities.
* Work closely with the AI research team to quickly identify new and potentially impactful developments in ML and AI.
* Support and enthuse our product managers in their quest to develop and deliver a market-changing solution that has its foundation rooted in a relentless focus on cutting-edge AI.
* Closely collaborate with our software engineers, MLOps engineers, and other stakeholders to ensure seamless integration of machine learning solutions into our products and services.

As such, this role represents a unique opportunity to have a broad impact on our organization and to contribute significantly to our technological evolution.

Job requirements

* Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science , Mathematics or a Physics related field with abundant ML experience.
* 5+ years of proven experience as a Data Scientist, preferably in a SaaS product domain.
* 1+ years experience in hiring and managing a team of data scientists.
* A preferred experience with ML/ AI that deals with physical processes and relations.
* Experience with cloud platforms and containerization technologies.
* Experience with one or more data science platforms like Dataiku, Databricks, DataRobot, etc.
* Strong programming skills in languages such as Python, Java, or Scala.

* Strong communication skills and ability to effectively convey technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
* Strong pre: experience with on-prem ML model training, inference and deployment for production-grade solutions.
* Pre: experience with advanced ML/ AI deployments within an industrial domain.

* Working on making the world of data centers more sustainable
* Enjoy a competitive salary, pension scheme, holiday allowance, and disability insurance.

Jij helpt ze data te benutten en krijgt de vrijheid om dat te doen op basis van je eigen inzichten. Jij ziet Splunk als de hamer in een gereedschapskist; een onmisbare tool om je werk mee uit te voeren.

Daarmee hebben we naam en faam gemaakt in verschillende sectoren en daar gaan we het liefst nog even mee door.

CINQ is opgesplitst in 3 business units met ieder een eigen expertise. Niet dat we ervan houden om in hokjes te denken, maar dit werkt in de praktijk nu eenmaal het beste. Ook voor onze klanten die een beroep doen op data engineers. Bij een klant meedraaien in een Splunk-team tot aan het uit de grond stampen van een splinternieuwe dataomgeving: als dataspecialist komt er van alles op je bord.

Toen je voor het eerst het gebouw van Malvern Panalytical betrad, werd je overweldigd door nieuwsgierigheid. Je had namelijk geen idee van de verbazingwekkende complexiteit die schuilging achter de muren. Want wie had kunnen vermoeden dat de geavanceerde systemen die hier worden ontwikkeld en vervaardigd, een cruciale rol spelen bij het optimaliseren van gewasgroei op Afrikaanse velden? Boeren die hun oogsten tot bloei laten komen met behulp van onze technologie, het was een verrassend inzicht.
Je was net zo verbaasd toen je hoorde over onze bijdrage aan de voedselkwaliteitscontrole. Onze systemen die schadelijke stoffen in voedsel kunnen opsporen, en zo bijdragen aan wereldwijde voedselveiligheid.
Maar het hoogtepunt was toen je hoorde over onze betrokkenheid bij de ontwikkeling van steeds duurzamere materialen. Onze systemen, die worden gebruikt bij onderzoek en fabricage processen bij klanten, analyseren monsters om te onderzoeken of materialen (nog) duurzamer gemaakt kunnen worden. Het idee dat onze technologie letterlijk bijdraagt aan een betere wereld is ronduit fascinerend en motiverend.
En jij, als machine tester, speelt een cruciale rol in ons proces. Door onze systemen te verfijnen en te testen ben jij degene die bepaald wanneer ze worden vrijgegeven en klaar zijn om te verschepen naar onze klanten. Het maakt je trots dat jouw werk cruciaal is in de weg naar innovatie, ontdekking en verbetering.
We zullen ons eerst voorstellen:  

Malvern Panalytical is een toonaangevende ontwikkelaar en leverancier van analytische röntgeninstrumentatie. We richten ons op het ontwikkelen en leveren van geavanceerde technologieën en instrumenten die wetenschappers, ingenieurs en onderzoekers helpen om een dieper inzicht te krijgen in de eigenschappen van materialen. Dit doen we voor diverse industrieën, waaronder chemie, farmaceutica, voedsel, mijnbouw, energie en meer.
Wie zoeken wij?  

We zijn op zoek naar enthousiaste en technisch vaardige collega’s die een passie hebben voor precisie en die willen werken aan state-of-the-art apparatuur in een uitdagende, hightech productieomgeving.
Als machine tester:  

Is het jouw taak om machines na de voormontage af te bouwen tot ze helemaal voldoen aan de eisen van de klant. Je voert daarbij ook een aantal testen uit om te bepalen of de machine naar behoren functioneert. Deze mechanische en functionele testen voer je zelfstandig uit.
Maar jouw rol rijkt verder dan alleen assemblage en testen. Wanneer er onregelmatigheden optreden ben jij degene die deze moet interpreteren en oplossen, of het nu gaat om elektronische problemen of mechanische gebreken. Jij bent uiteindelijk degene die bepaald of het systeem vrijgegeven mag worden voor verzending naar onze klanten.
Wat vragen we van jou?
	+ Ervaring in het werken in een technische- of productieomgeving
	+ Een opleiding bij voorkeur in de richting elektronica, mechatronica, fijnmechanica of autotechniek
	+ Basiskennis van de Engelse taal
	+ Een proactieve instelling en een analytische blik
	+ Je kunt gedisciplineerd en zeer nauwgezet werken
	+ Je werkt net zo makkelijk zelfstandig als in teamverband
Met wie en voor wie werk je?  

Onze afdeling productie in Almelo bestaat uit verschillende onderdelen, het proces begint bij assemblage en eindigt bij de test afdeling. In totaal werken er 130 collega’s bij de productie (waarvan 35 bij de testafdeling). De groep Machine Testers zijn verdeeld over 2 systemen namelijk de XRD en XRF.
Dit krijg je van ons:  

Een veelzijdige, uitdagende en boeiende functie binnen een hightech organisatie en waar veel nadruk ligt op persoonlijke ontwikkeling en groei. Het salaris bedraagt tussen €2.700 euro bruto en €3.385 euro bruto per maand op basis van een fulltime dienstverband, daarbij krijg je 8% vakantietoeslag en 8,33% eindejaarsuitkering. We kennen daarnaast 27 vakantiedagen en 13 roostervrije dagen. We hebben een goede pensioenregeling belegd bij PME.
Waarom kiezen voor Malvern Panalytical?
	+ Je wordt onderdeel van een groeiend, internationaal hightech bedrijf
	+ Je mag werken aan state-of-the-art systemen
	+ Onze technologieën worden gebruikt om een betere wereld te creëren
	+ Je vindt onze systemen in de meest uiteenlopende gebieden. Van de mijnbouw in de outback van Australië tot aan bodemonderzoek op de Zuidpool.

Developing Digital Twin Capabilities for the Dutch Electricity Transmission System.


Job description


TenneTwin project in collaboration with TenneT TSO in The Netherlands aims to develop the digital twin foundation for the Dutch electricity transmission system by applying digitalization, unlocking an unprecedented level of transparency. This enables optimal operation, maintenance, upgrading, and expansion of the power grid to match with the government and TenneT Target Grid 2045 ambitions.



Within the TenneTwin project, TU Delft is hiring two doctoral candidates on the subject: ""Developing Digital Twin Capabilities for the Dutch Electricity Transmission System"". You will develop a digital twin of the Dutch power grid to better utilise the electricity transmission system, ensure system stability and resilience, and help transmission system operators and policymakers make informed decisions. The research questions answered in TenneTwin project are (1) how to model the TenneT power system to suit the needs of the digital twin, (2) how to determine the sufficient modelling details and verify the model accuracy, (3) how to tune the model parameters to continuously match them with present reality, and (4) how to detect the actual power grid state in sufficient details and update the digital twin model to run simulations and advanced grid analytics?



Tackling these scientific questions requires a multi-disciplinary approach combining knowledge in electrical power systems and information and communication technologies, and excellent software coding skills.



PhD-1 focuses on modelling, version control, and simulation. This includes:



* Investigate modelling, simulation, and related data needs of the digital twin


* Model and simulate various (cross-domain) systems that are part of the digital twin in an effective and comprehensive way, preferably using one solver engine for all


* Develop mechanisms for the model initialisation, e.g., combined power system, communication, and market models, in different operating conditions



PhD-2 focuses on data sources, model adaptiveness and parameter tuning. This includes:



* Investigate the systems’ data needs to suit the purpose of the digital twin for continuous mirroring


* Develop mechanisms to detect and mirror actual systems’ conditions to their digital model counterparts


* Develop mechanisms to fine-tune the digital model parameters based on actual systems' data


* Explore cross-domain sub-system interactions and interdependencies through sensitivity analysis using simulations



We offer four-year PhD appointments, with an anticipated start date in November 2024.



You will be a member of the section Intelligent Electrical Power Grids, in Electrical Sustainable Energy (ESE) Department, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science at TU Delft.

Ben je een ondernemend persoon, continu opzoek naar kansen en wil je je techniekkennis verdiepen? Lees dan snel door!

Stel je voor: een belangrijke brug op een drukke snelweg geeft een storing. Tijdens de ochtendspits. Als maintenance engineer gaan jouw radertjes draaien. Hoe had dit voorkomen kunnen worden? Welke signalen zijn gemist? Jij hebt in jouw werk namelijk inzichtelijk hoe de bedrijfsmiddelen, oftewel de assets, van jouw opdrachtgever ervoor staan. Je houdt je dagelijks bezig met asset- en reliability management. Op basis van analyses maak je een goede afweging tussen prestaties, risico’s en kosten en doe je verbetervoorstellen.

**Wat ga je doen als Junior Maintenance Engineer?**

Als Junior Maintenance Engineer heb je bovenal één belangrijke missie: leren, ervaren en beter worden! Net als onze andere collega’s ga je vier van de vijf werkdagen als consultant aan de slag bij onze opdrachtgevers in de productie-industrie of infrasector. Je bent verantwoordelijk voor het optimaliseren van onderhoudstrategieën voor de bedrijfsmiddelen (assets). Je stelt onderhoudsconcepten op en vertaalt deze naar onderhoudsplannen en begrotingen.

Wij helpen je met de vakinhoudelijke kennis die je nodig hebt om de taken goed uit te voeren. Je wordt begeleid door een ervaren collega waarmee je wekelijks spart over je ervaringen en uitdagingen die je tegenkomt.

Wij staan graag met onze voeten in de klei, waarbij onze mensen de rol pakken van vakinhoudelijk expert tot kennis partner voor de klant.Veerenstael stimuleert ook jouw persoonlijke ontwikkeling. Als kennisbedrijf zijn de mensen ten slotte onze belangrijkste middelen om de klant te kunnen helpen. Sowieso maak je, samen met je leidinggevende, een persoonlijk ontwikkelingsplan waarin jouw ambities worden gekoppeld aan mogelijke projecten, leerervaringen en opleidingen. Daarnaast wordt je lid van één van onze Gildes; dit zijn vakgroepen waarin ontwikkelingen in een specialisme worden gevolgd, besproken en vertaald naar ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden voor Veerenstael. Voorbeelden van Gildes zijn; Maintenance management, Procesbeheersing, Data analytics en Change management.Naast ontwikkeling is sfeer natuurlijk net zo belangrijk.

-------------------


  
Wil jij de Rijksoverheid helpen met het doen van data science onderzoeken op het gebied van HR? Vind je het leuk om bij verschillende Rijksorganisaties over de vloer te komen om inzicht op basis van data analyses te geven en beleid te verbeteren? Dan zijn we bij het Analytics Lab (aLab) op zoek naar jou! Wij zoeken een ervaren data scientist met ervaring in data en tekstanalyses, en interesse voor HR.  

  

Bij het aLab van O&P Rijk heb je de mogelijkheid om data onderzoek uit te voeren in opdracht van organisaties binnen het Rijk. Hierbij zet jij jouw data science kennis en ervaring in om inzicht te geven over de medewerkers van de desbetreffende organisatie. Denk hierbij aan onderzoeken over verzuim, bewegingen binnen de organisatie, maar ook hoe inclusief vacatureteksten geschreven zijn.



Tijdens de projecten bezoek je verschillende Rijksorganisaties om samen met de opdrachtgever het onderzoek uit te voeren. Zo probeer jij vanuit je data expertise en de opdrachtgever met de organisatiekennis, de data en inzichten te doorgronden om samen met de opdrachtgever tot antwoorden op de businessvragen te komen. Iedere opdracht is anders; je levert altijd maatwerk, stelt de juiste vragen en weet die vragen te vertalen naar onderzoek en antwoorden.  

  

Als data scientist binnen het team help je daarnaast mee aan het ontwikkelen van het data gedreven werken binnen het HR-domein van het Rijk. Zo vertel je graag aan andere HR-analytics geïnteresseerden binnen het Rijk, over de onderzoeken die je doet en ga je met hen in gesprek om hun organisatie te ontwikkelen op dit gebied. Ook organiseer je samen met het team een paar keer per jaar HR-analytics community bijeenkomsten, waarbij je HR-experts binnen het Rijk samenbrengt om kennis te delen over het gebruik van data science op HR-gebied.  

  

Verder sta je er voor open om projecten uit te voeren om de dienstverlening van de organisatie te verbeteren met behulp van jouw data science expertise. Zo hebben we eerder onderzoek gedaan naar het ontwikkelen van nieuwe Frequently Asked Questions op basis van gebruikersdata met behulp van tekst analyse. Daarnaast blijven we op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen in data science. Zo verkennen we momenteel de ontwikkeling en het gebruik van een synthetische dataset.  

  

In het team communiceren we op een open manier en geven elkaar regelmatig constructieve feedback. Zo zorgen we voor de ontwikkeling van jou en de rest van het team. Een voorbeeld hiervan is het controleren van elkaars code. Ook bespreken we maandelijks in teamverband hoe het werk loopt en of hier verbeteringen mogelijk zijn.  

  

In ons team vinden we verschillen belangrijk. Iedereen werkt op zijn of haar eigen manier en hier is ook ruimte voor. Wil jij even sporten in je lunchpauze of ‘s middags je (klein)kind van school halen en ‘s avonds je werk afmaken? Dit is zeker mogelijk, omdat we hybride werken. We hanteren flexibele werktijden, maar starten de dag altijd samen. Online of op kantoor.

The Institute of Environmental Sciences CML and Faculty of Science is looking for:

 **Postdoctoral Researcher on Actor-level Global Food System Footprinting**  

**Vacancy number: 15045**


**Overview**  

We are seeking a highly motivated researcher to join our team as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Leiden University's CML Institute of Environmental Sciences, to work in the nascent field of actor-level global environmental footprinting. The postholder will help to develop a new global model to study the different roles consumers, farmers and companies play in food system sustainability transitions.


Global food system models lack detail of food system actors and their uneven influence on environmental risks. Microdata on food consumers, producers, and companies offers tremendous potential to pinpoint high-impact actors and distinguish their roles in sustainable food futures. Yet, enriching global food system models with actor-level data remains hindered by technical demands of linking disparate, unaligned, and conflicting information, using methods from macroeconomic, environmental, and nutritional modelling. This project will develop and implement innovative methods to couple food system actor data with macroeconomic models, to assess the socio-environmental impacts of food system transitions from a multi-actor perspective, in individual countries and globally.

**Key tasks:**  

You will work in an interdisciplinary setting to integrate models and data from different fields (e.g. food sciences, economics, environmental science, epidemiology). Specifically, you will:

* Further extend an integrated food system model with microdata on consumer diets, farmer practices and food company activities, to better attribute socio-environmental impacts of food systems to individual food system actors.
* Perform several detailed analyses on the environmental and social impacts of global food systems and food system transitions, from a multi-actor perspective.
* Disseminate scientific findings via high-impact scientific publications, international conferences, and policy exchanges.
* Within the project, you will work closely with Ass. Prof. Oliver Taherzadeh and others to develop the methods, data, and analytical frameworks to overcome the limited actor-level detail of global food system sustainability models. Dr. Taherzadeh is dedicated to creating an inclusive and open research environment which nurtures critical scholarship and mentoring of early career researchers from a diversity of backgrounds. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach to problem-driven research in which we help one other thrive. You will be based in Leiden, a vibrant city known for its rich scientific heritage. The role may involve international travel for research to present research findings and collaborate with leading experts in this field.

**Selection Criteria**  

The following criteria are essential:

* PhD degree in Industrial Ecology, Environmental Economics, Geography, or a related discipline, specialising in global environmental footprinting of food systems or national economies.
* Proven ability using industrial ecology methods, such as LCA, MFA, and (MR)IOA to assess the scale, drivers and socio-ecological impacts of global resource flows within the food system or wider economy.
* Expertise modelling the global impacts of food system transitions across multiple impacts (e.g. climate, biodiversity, deforestation, water, nutrition, food insecurity).
* Evidence of publications in respected scientific journals related to the topics above.
* Great interpersonal and communication skills, and excellent English language proficiency, with experience communicating scientific findings to a wide audience (e.g. policy makers, industry and the general public).


Any of these criteria are highly valued:

* Experience with one or more of the following methods: Geographic Information Systems (GIS), machine learning, network analysis, and econometrics
* Practice combining Industrial Ecology models and data to improve the accuracy and scope of environmental footprinting analysis
* Use of microdata related to food consumption (e.g. food intake surveys), production (e.g. farmer surveys) and trade activities (e.g. company-level data).
* An interdisciplinary knowledge of the societal and policy levers related to environmental and/or food system challenges
* Interest and experience in teaching related to environmental change and food system sustainability.


We are committed to building an inclusive and diverse team, welcoming applications from individuals of all backgrounds and experiences. Applications are particularly welcome and encouraged from women, black, and minority ethnic candidates, who are under-represented in posts in the CML.

***Challenge: Predict reactive processes affecting groundwater quality***  

***Change: Quantify uncertainty of complex water quality models using surrogate modeling***  

***Impact: More reliable and safe water quality management***


Job description


Reactive transport models are essential for assessing groundwater quality and contamination risks, which are critical for safe drinking water. However, uncertainties in model parameters and data hinder accurate predictions. Traditional uncertainty quantification (so-called Bayesian) methods require extensive computational resources, hindering robust uncertainty quantification for complex models.



This PhD position offers an exciting opportunity to address this challenge by leveraging surrogate modeling techniques. Surrogate models approximate computationally intensive models at reduced cost, enabling uncertainty quantification despite time budget constraints. Recent advances in machine learning techniques also offer promising opportunities to improve surrogate modeling approaches. In this project, you will develop surrogate models tailored to reactive transport models and integrate them into an uncertainty quantification framework.


**Key responsibilities:**


* Design and implement surrogate modeling strategies for efficient uncertainty quantification of reactive transport models.
* Evaluate and propagate surrogate model errors to improve uncertainty estimates.
* Apply the developed framework to real-world case studies in collaboration with international working groups in the field of water quality modeling.


At the intersection of hydrogeology, biogeochemistry and statistics, this project bridges method development with applications in water quality modeling and process understanding. Our department brings together experts in water quality and reaction processes, mathematical modeling of environmental systems, and statistical and machine learning techniques in water resources. You will also collaborate with AIdroLab, part of TU Delft AI, and the Statistical Model-Data Integration group at the University of Stuttgart.


Requirements


* Very good Master's degree in a relevant field such as environmental science, environmental engineering, hydrogeology, physics, or applied mathematics.
* Strong interest in uncertainty quantification, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning techniques. Demonstrated experience in at least one of these areas is a plus.
* Familiarity with numerical modeling and scientific programming, for example using Python, Julia or R.
* Experience in modeling reactive transport in groundwater is preferred.
* Very good written and spoken English as you will be working in an international community.
* Enthusiasm for interdisciplinary research involving experts from hydrogeology to statistics.


Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis.

As Lead Product Manager IT & Analytics you can have societal impact by working on state-of-the-art analytical models that process transactions from 9.5+ million Rabobank customers in order to detect Financial Crime.

**You and your job**


Preventing Money Laundering & Terrorist Financing is one of the key aspects for our society and our organisation, and as a bank we play a major role in this field. Within the Area Transaction Monitoring (TM) Detection in Rabobank we have built a data driven solution that processes more than 11 million transactions each day to detect customers which launder money or finance terrorists. As Lead Product Manager IT & Analytics, you have a big impact on the TM Area by being responsible for delivering the IT and Data Science foundation, which is used by multiple other model owners and model developers to detect financial crime. Your sub-Area consists of 5 squads (2 Data Science and 3 IT squads, 50+ FTE) and you closely collaborate with 2 of the 3 other sub-Areas within the Area TM Detection. The Area consists of extremely motivated, capable, and cooperative professionals working in an open, positive and dynamic environment.

**Practical Examples**

As Product Manager IT & Analytics you will:

* Define (long-term) strategy and roadmap for the sub-Area which is complementary to the strategy of the entire Area and other sub-Areas
* Drive progress on important IT and Data Science topics by diving into details, successfully working with multi-disciplinary experts and by making both content and process decisions
* Function as first point of contact for key stakeholders on topics where multiple squads are involved and coordinate with Product Owners and other Lead Product Managers
* Prepare written communication to senior management (up to board level) regarding key milestones of the team, risks and mitigating options and present them

**Facts & Figures**

* 36 hours per week
* 5 squads to lead, with 50+ team members from different disciplines (e.g., Data Scientists, IT specialists, Developers, Analytics Translators)
* 5 Product Owners as direct reports

 **Top responsibilities**

* Keep the overview of the joint responsibilities and dependencies of all 5 squads, spot risks and mitigate them in a timely manner
* Take responsibility for maintaining and innovating the platform and data science components in our TM model landscape and ensure that the changes and decisions align with current and future goals of the Area
* Create an environment where IT and Data Science squads collaborate efficiently

**Together we achieve more than alone**  

We believe in the power of difference. Bringing together people's differences is what makes us an even better bank. So we are very curious about what you can bring to our team.


The 200+ people in our Transaction Monitoring team are responsible for detecting money laundering and terrorism financing risks, using analytics models. Working together is the way we work; as 1 multi-disciplinary, highly talented and motivated team at Rabobank. Talking of Rabobank: We are a Dutch bank that operates in 38 countries for over 9,500,000 customers. Together with these customers, our members and partners we stand side by side to create a world in which everyone has access to enough healthy food. In the Netherlands we work to create a country in which people are happy with how they live, work and do business.

**You and your talent**

* Academic degree in a technical field (e.g., computer science, mathematics, econometrics or similar)
* 5+ years of experience as Product Manager/Owner/Project Manager/Team Lead of multiple squads
* Professional experience with IT and Data Science, including bringing Analytics Solutions to production
* Strong consulting skills; excellent presentation, structuring and advisory skills including top-down communication
* Strong ability to manage people from different disciplines and motivate, inspire and coach them
* Thrive in a high-impact, dynamic and high-paced environment
* Pro-active, independent and have a can-do mentality
* No experience in Financial Crime required, because in this sub Area we believe we could benefit more from best practices in different industries

**This is what we offer you**

* A 36-hour works week with a salary in scale 10 or 11 depending on your experience.
* An Employee Benefit Budget 11% of your monthly salary. You decide how to spend this budget.
* Thirteenth month's salary and 8% holiday allowance.
* Personal budget of € 1.400 to spend on activities related to your personal development and career flexible working times and location-independent working.
* Hybrid working (we work 1 or 2 days from the office a week) & flexible working times.

However, the mechanism of action (MOA) of these components is poorly understood. As a PhD in this project, you will decipher the MOA of mEV-mediated metabolic modulation of immune, liver and neuronal cells, analyse mEV composition during lactation, and investigate the impact of milk processing on mEVs.


The positions are supported by the public-private Health Holland TKI-LSH SIGNALERS Project, aiming to unlock the MOA of human mEVs.


**Your job**
------------


In this project, you will develop human cellular in vitro functional readout assays to analyse the metabolic modulatory activity of mEVs (e.g. by metabolic tracing studies (fluxomics)). You will connect these findings to the mEV cargo analysed by multi-omics approaches (i.e., metabolomics, proteomics and lipidomics), and you will intervene in mEV cargo and intracellular pathways to link mEV-cargo to function.


You will benefit from a close collaboration with the University Medical Center Utrecht and Nestlé Research. You will collaborate with Professor Leusen (Center for Translational Immunology, UMC Utrecht) for milk sample collection, with Dr de Theije (Department for Developmental Origins of Disease, UMC Utrecht) for neuronal cell modulation, and with researchers of Nestlé Research for proteomics analysis, data integration and mEV analysis metrics development.


Throughout the project, you will develop core skills in fundamental cell biology and metabolism research, in mass spectrometry and integrated multi-omics analysis, and gain insights in the role of mEVs in the development and intricate relationship of the liver-immune-brain axis. You will execute parts of the project at the partner institutes.


As a team, we prioritise effective collaboration, ongoing feedback, and both professional and personal development. At Utrecht University there are plenty of opportunities to facilitate your development.


**Your qualities**
------------------


You enjoy new scientific concepts and working in an international multidisciplinary team in both academia and industry. You have affinity with fundamental cell biology, metabolism and mass spectrometry and/or multi-omics analysis. And you like learning technical mass spectrometry skills and computational skills needed for the integration of in vitro cellular read-outs and multi-omics analysis. You see it as an interesting challenge to present research at (international) conferences and to stakeholders, and to supervise and educate (master)students on related projects.


Furthermore, you have:


* an MSc degree in Biology, Biomedical sciences, Biochemistry, (Veterinary) Medicine or in a related field and have a good grounding in cell biology and/or metabolism, the immune system, the nervous system or liver biology;
* proficiency in English speaking and writing;
* experience working with in vitro cell cultures (especially with immune, neuronal, and/or liver cell cultures), and/or (multi-)omics analysis would be an asset.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a job for for one year, with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period;
* a working week of 36 to 40 hours and a gross monthly salary between €2,770 and €3,539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth.

**About the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM)**  

Established in 1971, IVM is a leading environmental research institute that is internationally recognised for its high quality research output in a range of environmental disciplines, as well as for its interdisciplinary work. The mission of the institute is to contribute to sustainable development and care for the environment through scientific research and teaching. IVM aims to do excellent problem-oriented research that is useful to a wide range of stakeholders in the Netherlands and internationally. A unique strength of our research is to understand sustainability problems in their social and economic context. IVM’s research community works within four departments: Environmental Economics; Environmental Geography, Environmental Policy Analysis; and Water and Climate Risk. Since 2001 IVM has been part of the Faculty of Science at VU Amsterdam (legal name Stichting VU).


The department of Water and Climate Risk (WCR) studies hydrological and climate processes, and how these processes lead to risks and opportunities for society, the economy, and the environment. A defining characteristic of the department is a multi-disciplinary approach that combines expertise from natural sciences with knowledge from the fields of economics, e-Science and geography. This approach has led to a unique research portfolio of water and climate risk projects, and the department is a global leading institute in flood and drought risk assessment, and risk management research.


The department of Environmental Policy Analysis (EPA) at IVM is a team of more than 25 researchers that was evaluated in the most recent international research quality review as “world leading” and as being “one of the highest profile academic research groups involved with sustainability governance from around the world”. We address questions related to institutional effectiveness and change, governance innovation and complexity as well as learning and adaptation. Empirically, we have a strong focus on water, climate change and biodiversity.


The department of Environmental Geography (EG) conducts interdisciplinary research on the spatial aspects of environmental and social challenges and the solutions sustainable land use can provide to these.


The department of Environmental Economics (EE) leads the institute’s efforts in improving insights into the interaction between the environment and the economy. The department is one of the main groups of environmental economists in Europe, consisting of around 35 scientific staff and PhD researchers. The department strategy is to consolidate and further strengthen its position as a major player in the European field of environmental economics. Important fields of application include climate change, energy, circular economy, water, ecosystem services, and environmental and natural resource management. The philosophy of the EE department is to closely integrate its research projects with its teaching programme and to initiate and conduct research jointly with stakeholders and collaborating institutes.

Wij maken van Albert Heijn het beste omnichannel Food & Tech bedrijf en willen digitaal gemak voor iedereen. We testen en experimenteren, zijn innovatief en verleggen grenzen. Voor die reis hebben wij het Data Talent Track. Een track waarin wij jouw carrière als Data Analyst bij Albert Heijn een vliegende start geven binnen onze Digital Analytics afdeling. Is dit echt iets voor jou? Word dan de nieuwe Data Analyst in ons Data Talent Track!

  

  

**Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst ken jij onze klant het beste. Deze kennis verkrijg je door gebruik te maken van data (zoals bijvoorbeeld data over koopgedrag), om zo de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van data-oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk met de nieuwste data analytics technieken. Je maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Analytics & Data Science team, en bent daarmee onderdeel van de grotere Analytics community binnen Albert Heijn. Je beweegt makkelijk tussen Tech, Data Science en de business teams, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data analytics toepassingen. Je maakt impact als Data Analist door:

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

  



**Dit doe je als Data Analyst Digital**

Het Digital domein richt zich op digitale relevantie, experimentation, eCommerce en klantloyaliteit. Hiervoor voeren we data-analyses uit of ontwikkelen wij dataproducten om onze e-commerce en Digital-afdelingen te ondersteunen met inzichten rondom onze klanten, het verbeteren van e-commerce en het verbeteren van de customer journey. Denk daarbij aan projecten zoals het relevanter maken van onze aanbiedingen (Mijn Bonus Box) of marketing, inzichtelijk maken van de omnichannel customer journeys en het analyseren van onze spaarprogramma’s.

  



**Jouw ontwikkeling in het Data Talent Track**


Het Data Talent Track is een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen die je helpen om jouw professionele vaardigheden te ontwikkelen. Zo zijn er trainingen zoals persoonlijk leiderschap en het efficiënter schrijven van code, maar ga je bijvoorbeeld ook een dagje meehelpen in de winkel of bouw je mee aan de ideeën van de toekomst in een Hackathon. Wil je meer weten over hoe het Data Talent Track eruitziet? Neem dan vooral ook eens een kijkje hier.

En, niet onbelangrijk, ben je:

* Proactief; je geeft zowel gevraagd als ongevraagd advies
* Sterk in het adviseren van de business en meenemen van stakeholders
* Communicatief sterk; je weet complexe informatie aan een niet-technisch publiek uit te leggen

 **De beste ingrediënten voor een betekenisvolle baan**

* Een salaris van max € 4000,- per periode van 4 weken (afhankelijk van je ervaring)
* Een winstuitkering oplopend van 45 tot 130% van je gemiddelde periodesalaris

We sparen samen voor een heel goed pensioen. En wij betalen ruim 5 keer zo veel als jij. Zo ben je ook later verzekerd van een goed inkomen* Je kunt 45 (ja, vijfenveertig) dagen vrij nemen; 25,5 vaste vakantiedagen en 19,5 ADV dagen. Veel plezier!
* Je ontwikkelt je even snel als de tech waar we mee werken. Dankzij feedback loops met de best & the brightest tech savvy collega’s. En door actief bij te dragen aan de AH Technology community – plons in een zee aan kennis en inzichten!
* Een moderne laptop en smartphone zijn ‘inbegrepen’. Bovendien hamster je kortingen. Op verzekeringen en je boodschappen bijvoorbeeld
* Je neemt deel aan het Data Talent track, een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen, en daarnaast heb je ook toegang tot onze AH Data Academy met nog veel meer trainingen zowel op hard- als soft skills. Jou een vliegende kickstart geven en de kans om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen vinden wij namelijk erg belangrijk
* Een werkgever die het beste van twee werelden combineert: de kansen die je met een corporate associeert plus de autonomie en de “to boldly go where no person has gone before” drive die scale-ups kenmerkt
* De kans om miljoenen mensen gezonder, lekkerder en makkelijker te laten eten

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)
* Python en SQL

**Fijne pre's:**

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.

  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.  

  

Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?  

  

Naast een afgeronde Bachelor of Master en enkele jaren werkervaring zijn dit de specifieke skills die we zoeken:

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

In this project we investigate both the structural differences between human-made and AI-generated output as well as people’s differential behavioural and physiological responses to them. Concretely, we will study: (1) the spatiotemporal patterns of human-made and AI-generated images/artworks, texts and conversations; (2) people’s behavioural and physiological responses when viewing and reading human-made and AI-generated images/artworks and texts, respectively; (3) the extent and effects of synchronisation when people engage in conversations with chatbots. The goal is to develop a Radical Embodied Turing Test (RETT), on which next-generation AI-detection tools can be based and which can also help to enhance user experience with AI.

The selection criteria, set out in this Vacancy Notice, will be assessed by the Selection Committee throughout the different stages of the selection procedure. Before the start of the selection procedure, the Selection Committee will decide which selection criteria will be used at each stage of the selection procedure. Certain selection criteria will be assessed only for shortlisted candidates during a written test and/or a competency-based interview.  

  

The Selection Committee will assess the applications received in order to make an initial selection of those candidates meeting all eligibility criteria and matching best the selection criteria (suitability).

The Selection Committee will shortlist the **8** highest scoring candidates. All candidates having a score equal to the **8th** highest scoring candidate will be invited to take part in the selection procedure. At shortlisting stage, the Selection Committee will establish the pass-mark for the selection procedure.  

  

It is intended for the selection procedure to be conducted remotely. Should the Selection Committee consider it necessary to conduct the selection procedure on-site at Europol in the interest of the proceedings, and subject to budget availability, the candidates invited to participate in the selection procedure will be informed accordingly.  

  

After the selection procedure has taken place, the Selection Committee will establish a list of successful candidates, i.e. those scoring above the pre-defined pass-mark, which is shared with the AACC.  

  

The Selection Committee makes a proposal to the AACC on the candidate(s) to appoint. Following that proposal, the AACC makes a decision of appointment.  

  

Candidates who participated in the interview will be informed of the outcome, i.e. whether they have been successful or not. In view of the list of successful candidates established by the Selection Committee, the AACC retains the discretion to constitute a Reserve List. A Reserve List is valid for 24 months.

You should thrive in a fast-paced and purpose-driven work environment that provides high levels of autonomy.

This could involve undertaking initial data collection from corporate disclosures and public databases and/or reviewing the initial data collected by external research partners.
* Draft company scorecards that provide clear insights into a company’s leading practices as well as risks and opportunities.

* Participate in the team’s effort towards data cleaning, data management, data analysis, and data visualization.
* Contribute towards the drafting of key findings, research reports and articles.
* Suggest ways to improve methodologies, scoring guidelines, research workflows, and analytical techniques.

* Cooperate with your team to deliver accurate research outputs in a timely manner.
* Continually upskill on research methods and tools while enhancing your understanding of relevant industry trends and policy environments.

  


**What we are looking for:**


* At least three years of professional research experience in relevant fields.

* Strong verbal and written English communication skills; able to write clearly and concisely for professional audiences. Additional language skills are a plus.
* Solid grasp of applied statistics and data analysis as well as familiarity with database querying and spreadsheets. Ability to script in R or Python is a plus.

* Strong interest in research, especially on corporate performance on sustainable development and the business and policy environments that shape that performance.
* Passion for making a difference with a curious mindset and a ‘can do’, hands-on and professional attitude.
* Potential to thrive in a teal culture based on self-managed teams, able to take initiative, self-reflect and collaborate with colleagues.
* Comfortable in a globally inclusive, multi-cultural, fast-paced, agile, and virtual/hybrid environment that promotes flexibility whilst being able to meet deadlines.

**Company**

A.P. Moller-Maersk (Maersk) is a worldwide transport and logistics company with offices in around 130 countries and with global headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark. Maersk is listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Maersk employs roughly 95,000 people and generated total revenue of 51 billion USD in 2023. Maersk is currently undergoing a complex transformation from having been a relatively diversified conglomerate to becoming a focused transport and logistics company.


APM Terminals (APMT), a maritime terminal operator and core business unit of Maersk, operates one of the world’s most comprehensive port networks, which is uniquely positioned to help both shipping line- and landside customers grow their business and achieve better supply chain efficiency, flexibility and dependability to compete and win in world markets. The APMT team of 23,000 industry professionals across 42 countries and spanning five continents, is focused on providing customers with the most advanced terminal technology, equipment and operations in the industry across a network of +75 ports. In 2023, APM Terminals generated revenues 3.8 billion USD and carried out 40 million TEUs.


APMT is, like Maersk, undergoing an all-encompassing transformation from a multi-local, loosely coupled portfolio of individual terminals towards an integrated, best-in-class global terminal operator and stevedore. We casually refer to the journey as ‘ *from freestyle to franchise’* . The transformation involves developing and rolling out APMT’s *Way of Working* , built around a common operating system founded on Lean principles. It also entails a fundamental overhaul of our (digital) enterprise architecture to enable data-fueled business decisions, and cross-pollination of standard processes across our operations, including automation. Finally, the transformation aims to embed a culture of joint problem solving, (local) entrepreneurship and a collaborative mindset across our organization, including strong(er) linkages between our HQ- and frontline teams.

**De rol in hoofdlijnen**  

Je gaat werken als journalist/redacteur voor **Assurantie Magazine (AM),** het grootste onafhankelijke nieuwsplatform voor financieel dienstverleners. Van verzekeraar tot hypotheekverstrekker en van schadebehandelaar tot pensioenadviseur; AM is al ruim 40 jaar de go-to nieuwsbron voor de verzekeringsbranche. Het is een competitieve, dynamische wereld vol botsende belangen, maar ook een branche met talloze mooie innovaties en maatschappelijke uitdagingen, zoals: hoe verzekeren we de energietransitie, en de steeds grotere cybercrime dreiging?


In deze rol:


* Draag jij met je spraakmakende, diepgravende artikelen en scoops bij aan structurele groei van het aantal betalende abonnees.
* Werk je voor AMweb.nl, waarmee je focus op digitale media ligt en je mede op basis van data je vervolgstappen bepaalt.
* Ben je binnen de redactie owner van je eigen dossiers die vallen onder belangrijke thema’s voor de verzekeringsbranche.
* Ben je als journalist actief betrokken bij de sector. Je kent onze doelgroep door en door, en je onderhoudt je netwerk goed.

De redactie van vijf redacteuren werkt aan eigen dossiers binnen thema’s zoals Schade, Hypotheken en het Intermediair, maar is ook nauw betrokken bij de AM Top 100 en ons jaarlijkse grote event voor de branche: AMdag.


Onze redactie ontmoet elkaar een vaste dag per week op kantoor, dan hebben we met elkaar ook de wekelijkse inhoudelijke redactievergadering, en daarnaast spreken we flexibel af en werken we samen via Teams.  



  

  

**Wat breng jij mee?**


* Je hebt journalistieke ervaring, en een portfolio van artikelen en verhalen waar je trots op bent.
* Je bent nieuwsgierig, onderzoekend en kritisch en verdiept je graag in de hete hangijzers en trends binnen de branche.
* Je houdt van de afwisseling die werken op een redactie meebrengt, je vindt het leuk mee te denken over en te schakelen tussen het schrijven van nieuwsberichten en scoops enerzijds en inhoudelijke artikelen die diepgravend onderzoek vragen anderzijds.
* Je hebt kennis van de financiële dienstverlening, of bovengemiddelde interesse en de wil om snel alles te weten te komen over onze doelgroep.


**Ons aanbod**


* Bij VMN kom je om te leren, de ruimte om je journalistieke ideeën te realiseren, en voor de goede werk/privé balans. Wij werken hybride en je hebt veel vrijheid om je eigen werkweek in te delen.
* Wij organiseren veel sociale en inhoudelijke bijeenkomsten, waar je ook de andere VMN collega’s ontmoet, zo kun je leren van en ervaringen uitwisselen met andere journalisten/redacteuren en externe sprekers of trainers. Hoogwaardige journalistiek is de kern van onze organisatie: hierin investeren vinden we belangrijk.

-------------------


  
Het ministerie van BZK ontvangt steeds meer en steeds omvangrijkere Woo-verzoeken. Om te zorgen voor de zorgvuldige én snelle afhandeling zoekt het ministerie enthousiaste en gedreven informatiespecialisten.


Als informatiespecialist werk je aan het efficiënt afhandelen van Woo-verzoeken. In Nederland heeft iedereen - burgers, bedrijven, het parlement en journalisten – recht op toegang tot informatie van de overheid. Dat is vastgelegd in de Wet open overheid (Woo), de opvolger van de Wet openbaarheid bestuur. Het is jouw taak om snel en zorgvuldig de benodigde documenten te vinden. Vervolgens beoordeel je de documenten en bereid je ze voor op openbaarmaking, door het lakken van de juiste informatie (zoals persoonsgegevens). Je werkt nauw samen met interne collega's, zoals dossierhouders en juristen, om ervoor te zorgen dat het proces soepel verloopt. Daarnaast draag je bij aan het verbeteren van onze processen door het implementeren van data-gedreven benaderingen en het verbeteren van onze tooling, zoals de laksoftware.


Je onderhoudt contacten met de collega’s binnen het ministerie en informeert betrokkenen over de voortgang van je werkzaamheden. Je signaleert snel problemen of stagnatie tijdens het afhandelingsproces en escaleert wanneer dat nodig is. Door goed samen te werken en oplossingsgericht te handelen, draag je bij aan een betere afhandeling van Woo-verzoeken.


Daarnaast werken we hard aan procesverbeteringen. Daarom willen wij het zoekproces naar relevante documenten steeds meer informatie gedreven inrichten, waarbij we gebruik maken van slimme tooling. Dat doe je als informatiespecialist door het bouwen van queries met de juiste zoektermen, om zo snel en gemakkelijk de relevantie documenten te vinden.


We zijn volop in ontwikkeling om dit te realiseren en zoeken nieuwe collega’s die hier hun steentje willen bijdragen. Ook draag je bij aan de doorontwikkeling van onze huidige instrumenten en tools, zoals onze laksoftware en de sturingsinformatie in ons dashboard.

-------------


  
* Je hebt ervaring in een rol als zoekspecialist en met het structuren en doorzoekbaar maken van data;

* Je weet snel een weg te vinden in verschillende informatiebronnen, zoals ons documentmanagementsysteem, mailboxen en netwerkschijven;
* Je hebt kennis van wettelijke gronden waarop informatie beoordeeld dient te worden of bent bereid dit te leren;
* Je bent flexibel en je werkt graag oplossingsgericht;
* Je bent gewend om gestructureerd en waar nodig onder hoge tijdsdruk te werken;
* Je beschikt over uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



In november 2023 is het Woo-team gestart om binnen BZK te zorgen voor een versnelling en verbetering in de afhandeling van Woo-verzoeken. Ons team heeft een centrale plek in de organisatie en ontlast de beleidsdirecties bij het afhandelen van Woo-verzoeken. We werken nauw samen met de juridische afdeling van BZK. In ons team werken informatiespecialisten en Woo-regisseurs samen om de Woo-verzoeker beter van dienst te zijn en te zorgen voor een vlot en open proces. De Woo-regisseur voert regie op het proces en onderhoudt contacten met de verzoeker. We maken nu een vervolgstap in de ontwikkeling van het team. Het Woo-team groeit in aantal collega’s, zodat we bij meer Woo-verzoeken ondersteuning kunnen bieden. Ook breiden we uit qua juridische expertise. Daarmee kunnen we ook meer stappen in het proces ondersteunen.



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.",data journalist,https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl/vacatures/informatiespecialist-woo-verzoeken-BZK-2024-0701,https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/ministerie-van-binnenlandse-zaken-en-koninkrijksrelaties,,,"5,001 to 10,000",,,,,,,57af6ec7f513cb63,,nl,,,

 **Vacature**

**Communicatiemedewerker GGD** **(24 uur)**

 **Hoe ziet jouw toekomstige werkdag eruit?**  

Je start de werkdag goed met een lekkere kop koffie. Samen met je collega’s praat je bij over het weekend. Maar niet te lang, want aan het begin van de ochtend heb je meteen de weekstart van de GGD. Samen met je communicatiecollega’s bespreek je welke gezondheidsonderwerpen je de komende periode uitlicht. Dit doe je aan de hand van de omgevingsscan waarop je aanhaakt bij de behoefte van de inwoners, de contentplanning en ons jaarplan.


Hierna ga je gelijk aan de slag met het maken van content. De nieuwe social mediacampagne moet namelijk vandaag worden ingepland. Jij weet als geen ander hoe je met creatieve content de doelgroep kan bereiken. Naast je eigen kennis en ervaring, gebruik je hierbij de data en resultaten van eerdere, gelijksoortige campagnes.


De tijd vliegt en voor je het weet is het lunchtijd. Je loopt een rondje met je collega’s om even de benen te strekken. Als je terugkomt start een online meeting met een projectleider over een nieuwe voorlichtingscampagne. Je stelt vragen over doel, doelgroep en adviseert vervolgens over middelen.


Na de meeting neem je de tijd om je mail bij te werken. Je ontving een vraag van een journalist. Samen met de inhoudsdeskundige die de woordvoering doet, formuleer je de antwoorden op de vragen. Later deze week begeleid je het persmoment. Het laatste uur voer je een maandelijkse analyse uit om het gebruikersgedrag op de websites in beeld te brengen. Dit geeft weer nieuwe inzichten om de website te optimaliseren. Voldaan klap je je laptop dicht en verheug je je op morgen. Want morgen is weer een nieuwe dag die totaal anders kan zijn!

**Wat ga je doen?**  

Binnen onze veiligheidsregio hebben we de unieke combinatie van gezondheid (GGD) én veiligheid (Brandweer, Crisisbeheersing). Als communicatiemedewerker richt jij je op operationele taken van de GGD. Jouw werkgebied is breed en omvat afgebakende, uitvoerende werkzaamheden waarbij je nauw samenwerkt en spart met je communicatiecollega's.


Daarnaast zijn we een crisisorganisatie, wat betekent dat je ook bereid bent deel te nemen aan een communicatiepiket tijdens crisissituaties. Gemiddeld ben je 8 tot 10 keer per jaar een week lang bereikbaar en beschikbaar voor communicatieve werkzaamheden tijdens crisissituaties. Dit doe je samen met andere collega's die piket hebben die week.

* Data checken: communicatiekanalen en communicatiecampagnes analyseren en data gebruiken om onze strategieën te verbeteren.
* Samenwerken: met verschillende teams en vormgever om communicatieprojecten van start tot finish te brengen.

**Wat breng je mee?**

* Diploma in communicatie of een vergelijkbare studie.
* Ervaring met traditionele en moderne communicatiemiddelen en campagnes.
* Top skills voor het maken pakkende teksten en beelden waarmee je onze doelgroep raakt.
* Sterk in vormgeving en bekend met tools, zoals Canva.

* Sterke verbale en schriftelijke communicatie.
* Zelfstarter met een proactieve mindset.

* Coachende vaardigheden en het vermogen om collega's te begeleiden en afdelingen te ondersteunen bij hun communicatie.

**Jouw team:**  

Je werkt in een leuk en enthousiast communicatieteam met 12 collega’s. Een team dat grotendeels bestaat uit jonge professionals, maar ook met enkele collega’s die al langer in het vak zitten. We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**  

Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA. Je komt te werken in een crisisorganisatie vol afwisseling. De coronacrisis, vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne, het hoogwater van de Maas of een grote brand. Wij waren erbij betrokken. Als communicatiemedewerker zit je bij ons nooit stil.


Je kunt je eigen werktijden en werkplek bepalen. Wij werken vanuit vertrouwen waarbij vrijheden en verantwoordelijkheden hand in hand gaan. Er zijn dus volop mogelijkheden om je privé- en werksituatie met elkaar te combineren.

Waarom goede Informatieverstrekking vanuit de RDW belangrijk is? De data waarover de RDW beschikt speelt elke dag een grote en belangrijke rol in de maatschappij: in de rechtszekerheid van mensen, in duurzaamheid, en vooral in de veiligheid van ons allemaal.

Werken aan de mobiliteit van morgen  
Van de politie die informatie opvraagt over een kenteken tot een journalist die onderzoeksvragen heeft over kentekens en rijbewijzen in Nederland: als unitmanager zorg jij dat alle externe partijen op tijd de juiste informatie krijgen. Je geeft leiding aan collega’s en zet hen in hun kracht, ontwikkelt strategische plannen en realiseert afspraken en doelen volgens het managementcontract.

Bovendien werk je samen met onze relatiemanagers om effectief contact te houden met externe partners, zoals brancheorganisaties en medeoverheden.

Daarnaast ben je teamlid van het managementteam van de afdeling, met wie je het beleid ontwikkelt en afstemt. We zijn volop bezig met de doorontwikkeling van onze afdeling. Jij helpt ons de volgende stap te zetten: je kijkt hoe we onze dienstverlening beter kunnen structureren en professionaliseren, bijvoorbeeld met de inzet van data-intelligence. Je houdt externe ontwikkelingen in de gaten, vertaalt deze naar onze afdeling en je unit en zet kansen voor innovatie om in projecten. Daarvoor werk je nauw samen met ICT-serviceteams om te zorgen dat de oplossingen onze doelen ondersteunen. Ook ben je opdrachtgever van stuurgroepen bij multidisciplinaire projecten.

Dit is jouw thuisbasis  
Jouw unit Informatieverstrekking bestaat uit zo'n 32 collega’s en je geeft direct leiding aan de teammanagers, unitadviseurs en onder andere de medewerkers die zich bezighouden met privacy en security. We vormen een hechte club: we zijn betrokken, staan altijd voor elkaar klaar en hebben oog voor wie jij bent, als collega én als mens. Ook organiseren we leuke teamuitjes om onze band te versterken. Door je centrale rol in onze organisatie ben je vaak op kantoor te vinden, maar thuiswerken kan ook: jij voelt goed aan wanneer dat kan!

Je vertaalt data naar concrete inzichten waarmee de redactie nog meer impact kan maken, duikt in de cijfers om trends te duiden en geeft journalisten advies hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter op de bezoeker afstemmen.  

  

**Functieomschrijving**  

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van het AD in Rotterdam. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data. Dat betekent dat je met cijfers bezig bent, maar ook veel met redactieleden overlegt en ze traint in hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter online presenteren. Je analyseert, rapporteert en geeft dus advies.

  


Je gaat op zoek naar antwoorden op vragen als: Waarom haken mensen af in een artikel? Wat is de ideale mix aan verhalen? Wat is de optimale spreiding van artikelen over de dag? En waarom stijgt of zakt het bezoek de afgelopen weken?

  


De adviezen geef je op drie ‘snelheden’: live, in dag- en weekrapporten en in losse analyses. Op de dag zelf kijk je met een schuin oog mee naar de cijfers en deel je belangrijke actiegerichte inzichten met de redactie. In dag- en weekrapporten geef je duiding aan de cijfers. Naast de dagelijkse taken voer je ook regelmatig diepgravende analyses uit.

  


Je bent een belangrijke sparringpartner voor de chefs en hoofdredactie bij AD en werkt nauw met hen samen.

Naast redactie-analisten zijn er diverse centrale rollen in het team die jou bij je werk zullen ondersteunen.  

  

**Functieprofiel**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.


**VOORWAARDEN**


* salaris, passend bij jouw ervaring;
* 38-urige werkweek, minder uur in overleg;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;
* ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden d.m.v. opleidingen en trainingen;
* We geloven in een gezonde werk-privébalans waarbij je voldoende ruimte krijgt voor jouw welzijn en flexibel werken.

Waag Futurelab doet al bijna 30 jaar onderzoek naar hoe technologie kan worden ingezet voor sociale innovatie. Bekende projecten van Waag zijn o.a. Fairphone, de meest duurzame smartphone ter wereld of De Digitale Stad, een van de allereerste social media platforms van Nederland. Of denk aan Operatie Sigismund, een van de eerste educatieve games in Nederland die leerlingen laat ervaren hoe spannend een archief is en nog steeds wekelijks gespeeld wordt in het Drents Archief.


 Je toekomstige collega Ouarda vertelt over werken bij Waag*: ‘De vrijheid die ik van de organisatie krijg om mijn eigen projecten in te kleuren doet mij heel erg goed. Collega’s waarderen mij, ik kan mezelf zijn en dat maakt het een fijne werkplek.’*


Waag werkt in een team van ontwerpers, kunstenaars en wetenschappers, dat publieke onderzoeksmethoden toepast op technologie en de samenleving. Daarmee stelt Waag zoveel mogelijk mensen in staat mee te ontwerpen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Dat doen we door gezamenlijk opkomende technologie te onderzoeken en onderliggende culturele aannames te bevragen en door alternatieven te ontwerpen op basis van publieke waarden. Zo proberen we bij te dragen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Op waag.org vind je meer informatie over Waag en over de projecten waaraan wij werken.


Diversiteit is cruciaal om technologie en de samenleving meer open, eerlijk en inclusief te maken. Daarom moedigen we kandidaten van diverse culturele achtergronden aan om te solliciteren. Mocht je denken niet aan alle eisen te voldoen, willen we je toch aanmoedigen om te solliciteren. Sommige kwaliteiten zijn niet in bulletpoints te vangen.

Van werkstress tot machineveiligheid en van hybride werken tot gevaarlijke stoffen. Arbo is het platform dat arboprofessionals ondersteunt in hun dagelijks werk. Door ze te informeren over ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken. Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.  

  

**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.



Als hoofdredacteur Arbo ben je onderdeel van de centrale redactie van het ‘professionals portfolio’ van VMN media, waar ook PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb onderdeel van zijn. Samen zijn we een team van 14 personen.

 **Wat krijg je:**


* **Fijn team** – Leuke, betrokken collega’s die samen mooie content voor de doelgroep maken. Binnen het Arbo-team, maar ook in nauwe samenwerking binnen het professionals portfolio.
* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.



Verder nog handig om te weten: het gaat om een functie van 36 uur per week. Het kantoor van VMN media staat in Zeist.


**Je bent overtuigd**  

Solliciteer dan direct! Heb je vragen over de procedure of over VMN media als werkgever? Neem dan contact op met onze Corporate Recruiter Jasper Magis via 06 15 64 39 50 of jaspermagis@vmnmedia.nl.
