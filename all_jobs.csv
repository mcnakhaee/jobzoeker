For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to preempt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

From our people who are caring, candid, and impact-driven to our business, which is innovative and rooted in science, we believe that being proudly unique, determined to be our best, and authentic is essential to fulfilling our purpose.
The role
Join our dynamic bioinformatics team at Genmab as a student data engineer, where you will play a crucial role in supporting our scientists by creating and managing sophisticated data architectures aligned with FAIR principles. In this position, you will focus on integrating real-world clinical and molecular data into graph database models to facilitate complex data analysis and enable innovative research methodologies. You will also explore the application of natural language processing for effective data querying. This internship offers a unique opportunity to develop expertise in data engineering technologies, contribute to bioinformatics solutions, and directly impact our research in developing groundbreaking therapeutic strategies. Your work will support essential projects aimed at enhancing drug discovery and development processes, fostering your growth as a data scientist and making a meaningful impact in the field of biomedicine.*Project Background*
Translational research leverages real-world data sets to study how patients respond to cancer treatments. This research often involves integrating complex and non-standardized molecular and clinical data. Clinical datasets, designed to answer specific scientific questions, typically lack detailed data granularity, making exploration challenging. Understanding the clinical data model is crucial to selecting the appropriate variables for analysis.
This project proposes the use of graph databases to overcome these challenges by organizing data into a flexible, multidimensional structure that facilitates easier access and more intuitive querying. Graph databases, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, allow for the discovery of implicit relationships within the data that traditional table-based databases might miss. Through this initiative, we aim to develop and evaluate AI-driven querying techniques using natural language, enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets in translational research.
Responsibilities* Technology Exploration: Investigate various graph database technologies and their applicability to managing clinical data, assessing their strengths and limitations in this domain.
* Data Model Comparison: Compare and analyze the data structures of graph and relational databases to identify the most effective frameworks for clinical data.
* Pilot Database Development: Design and implement a prototype database focused on the standardization of clinical real-world data, ensuring it supports robust data integration and access.
* Natural Language Query Development: Create methods to enable querying of graph databases using natural language, employing advanced AI technologies to facilitate intuitive data interactions.
* Findings Presentation: Regularly present progress and insights during team meetings, ensuring clear communication of developments and challenges.
* Bonus Objective: Develop a user interface that enables easy querying, and effective visualization and presentation of results from the database.


Requirements* Education: You are a BSc/MSc student in bioinformatics, computational biology or a related field.
* Technical skills: Demonstrated strong technical skills, with substantial experience in Python programming. Familiarity with AWS is an added advantage.
* Soft skills: Comfortable with pioneering research and creative processes; scientific thinking and connecting that to technical requirements.


About You* You are passionate about our purpose and genuinely care about our mission to transform the lives of patients through innovative cancer treatment
* You bring rigor and excellence to all that you do. You are a fierce believer in our rooted-in-science approach to problem-solving
* You are a generous collaborator who can work in teams with diverse backgrounds
* You are determined to do and be your best and take pride in enabling the best work of others on the team

**That’s why we love them!**

  


Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

  

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.


Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

  

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  

Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.



In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

  

**The role in 6 bullets**

  

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

 **Your track record mentions**

  

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

  


**Why join Orbisk?**



For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

  

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Are you fascinated by sustainability issues and do you have experience and affinity with researching the effects of land use on climate? Then we are looking for you!***  

  

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research into monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).  

  

While the team’s main focus is on forests we also conduct research into the role of land use and forest management in greenhouse gas emissions and removals in a broader context involving the whole LULUCF sector, including other land uses. Team members are responsible for the compilation of the national greenhouse gas inventory for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. For this we develop and work with geographically explicit instruments (such as models and monitoring) that can be used to determine the effects of the management or change in land use of forests, cropland, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other land. We closely collaborate with other experts on land use and soil at Wageningen Environmental Research and external research institutes to bring together all required information for the LULUCF monitoring.  

  

We use our knowledge and tools to draw up the international (Climate Convention, Paris Agreement, EU) and national (Climate and Energy Outlook) reports of greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. With our science-based expertise we also support the development and evaluation of climate policy of the Dutch government and European Commission. For instance, we currently support the European Commission in drafting the methodologies for certification of carbon removals in forests, wetlands and agricultural soils (carbon farming).  

  

**Your duties and responsibilities:**  

As LULUCF researcher you will contribute to further improving our methodologies for calculating carbon stock changes towards higher Tier levels according to the IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. This will involve the compilation and collection of new emission factors for carbon stock changes in living biomass, dead organic matter or soils and/or emissions of methane or nitrous oxide due to land use or land use change.  

  

Depending on your expertise you will be responsible for the improvements for several land use categories covered by the LULUCF sector and/or the further development of spatially explicit approaches. You also contribute to the acquisition of new externally funded projects.  

  

**You will work here**  

You will be placed in the team SFE of WENR, based at the Wageningen Campus of Wageningen University and Research, but you will also collaborate intensively with colleagues in other teams at WENR as well as with researchers in other research institutes in the Netherlands and internationally.  

  

You will be working in an enthusiastic team of about 24 colleagues working on options for conservation, restoration, development and sustainable use of trees and forests from an ecological perspective. We focus on the way in which policy, management and climate affect ecological processes and what their consequences are for climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and restoration, delivery of ecosystem services and other specific policy goals.

Are you an ambitious bioinformatician with a solid background in omics data analysis and experience in the field of immunology and/or infectious disease research? Then this bioinformatician position is the job for you!



Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”



Unique to this job  

We are an international, dynamic, highly motivated team of scientists at different stages of our careers with a strong drive to push research for the benefit of Public Health.

We know what it takes to lead UPS into tomorrow—people with a unique combination of skill + passion. If you have the qualities and drive to lead yourself or teams, there are roles ready to cultivate your skills and take you to the next level.

**Job Description:**

**IT Internship: GenAI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision**
==============================================================


Are you a student looking to launch your Information Technology career? If so, then UPS is the place for you! We will give you the opportunity to work on practical business problem in the Logistic industry using Digitization techniques and Artificial Intelligence.


UPS is a leader in Information Technology. If you are a highly motivated student working on a degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, Mathematics, Engineering, Business, Human Resources, Finance, or a related degree, then UPS is a great place for you to start your career.


Explore your next opportunity at a Global Fortune 500 organization. Envision innovative possibilities, experience our rewarding culture, and work with talented teams that help you excel every day. We know what it takes to lead UPS into tomorrow, – people with a unique combination of skills and passion. If you have the qualities and drive to lead yourself then this role will help you to cultivate your skills and take you to the next level. As a part of the internship, you will have opportunity to learn and develop the following business cases:

**Document Indexing (DOCIDX)**


Indexing scanned documents based on an embedded barcode of any type like CODE39, QR... is essential for any later processing, such as storage and retrieval, distribution to other departments or customer, and other back-office processing. We would like you to work on creating a reusable interface to index scanned documents in bulk, easily customizable for any environment and task.

**Package Type Detection (PKGDCT)**


UPS operates a large number of automated package-processing facilities. Not all packages processed have the perfect cube shape and size. We need to detect the shape of the packages (e.g., envelope, regular box, big size, irregular…) so that they are processed with the care required for each type, or even detect warning conditions like broken packages or liquid leaks.

**Job Description:**


As a computer vision scientist, you will review the current process flow the cases for image acquisition, either paper-based or digital documents for the case #1 and explore different options to capture package images from operational facilities to be later processed in case #2. For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-------------------


Join us – we look forward to welcoming you to our Self-Organizing Soft Matter Research Group at Eindhoven University of Technology!


We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Researcher with a passion for quantitative microscopy and physical chemistry of self-assembling materials to join our team to image the behavior of ice-interactive biomaterials on ice with single-molecule resolution. The goal of your project is to develop and use state-of-the-art microscopy tools and quantitative image analysis approaches to discover the physical principles underpinning the activity of novel ice-interactive biomaterials and to tune their interaction with ice to modulate activity as desired.


Key Responsibilities:


* Conduct high-quality, curiosity-driven, original, and independent research focusing on quantitative imaging and super-resolution microscopy of self-assembling materials
* Collaborate with a multi-disciplinary and international team of researchers
* Present research findings at conferences and publish in top-tier scientific journals
* Mentor and support junior researchers in the lab


The formation and growth of ice during freezing, storage, and/or thawing of cryopreserved materials limits the potential of cryopreservation technology for the long-term storage of sensitive materials, such as cells, tissues, and organs. Our group aims to unravel how biological and engineered ice-interactive materials function so that we can create customized chemical cryoprotectants for biomedical and other applications. Recently, we reported sub-zero super-resolution microscopy experiments which allowed us to study for the first time the interfacial dynamics of ice-bound ice-binding proteins at the single molecule level (see PNAS publication for more information). In this project you will build upon these pioneering experiments. You will image the interaction with ice of a novel class of engineered ice-interactive materials at the single molecule level to advance our understanding of how their structure and properties impact their ability to modulate ice crystal formation and growth. In this exciting role, you will work in a vibrant and international research group aiming to advance molecular insight into the working mechanism of novel ice-interactive materials for biomedical applications.

-------------------


  
Are you an ambitious bioinformatician with a solid background in omics data analysis and experience in the field of immunology and/or infectious disease research? Then this bioinformatician position is the job for you!



Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”



Unique to this job  

We are an international, dynamic, highly motivated team of scientists at different stages of our careers with a strong drive to push research for the benefit of Public Health.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-------------------


This project aims to understand how people living in the Netherlands perceive different climate change-related health risks, how they search for and process information about these risks, and what factors determine readiness to act, to ultimately make recommendations about how to communicate effectively about the health impacts of climate change.


To do this, four studies are performed utilizing survey designs, social media analysis, and mixed methods (survey and focus groups/interviews). As a start, the risk perceptions of the general public in relation to several possible health risks related to climate change are examined. Special attention is paid to vulnerable groups, such as elderly, children, individuals with chronic diseases and migrants. Based on the results of this first study and literature review, a particular subgroup and risk will be chosen to focus on (for example mental health of young people, or heat stress among the elderly) in the subsequent studies.

Computer skills should include SPSS, SAS, R or similar statistical software. Applicants must have excellent speaking and writing skills in English and preferably Dutch, should hold a strong motivation for the research topic ‘planetary health’ and are fairly interested in risk communication.


**Employment conditions and benefits**
--------------------------------------


We offer you an internationally oriented and varied job in an enthusiastic team, with excellent working conditions in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU).


The start date of this position is 02-SEP-2024 and you will be based at **[**class.26087] in Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM). This position is for 1 fte - 1 fte.

=======================================================================


To study the impact, societal costs and benefits and equity consequences of different prevention strategies, using simulation models and large data sets.


Closing date 11-07-2024
26.04.24.TG
  
### **Job description**


Should health prevention be targeted at individuals with the highest risk of disease or towards the entire population? What are the societal costs and benefits of these two approaches? And how do they impact health inequalities?  

  

If you get excited about these questions, we are looking for you: an ambitious postdoctoral researcher to join our multidisciplinary research team.  

  

In this project, you will analyze the population- and distributional impact of targeted and population-based interventions on health, societal costs and benefits and equity impact. You will develop and use simulation models to investigate the impact of the key ingredients on the distributional impact of public health interventions: the distribution of the risk factor, the initial distribution of the health outcome, the exposure-outcome relationship and the (potentially heterogeneous) effectiveness of the intervention. You will combine these models with detailed administrative and survey data to apply the theoretical insights to one ore more case studies. One potential application is the introduction of sugar taxes in the Netherlands and their effect on overweight and obesity and weight-related health outcomes.  

  

You will be supervised by prof. dr. Frank van Lenthe and dr. Joost Oude Groeniger based at the department of Public Health of Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam and dr. Bram Wouterse at the Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management. You will also collaborate with experts on public health and economic evaluations at these schools and within the Smarter Choices for Better Health initiative.


  
### **Work environment**


You will be based at the department of Public Health at Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam.  

  

This project is part of the Erasmus Initiative 'Smarter Choices for Better Health' in which Erasmus University and Erasmus MC Rotterdam jointly work on research on prevention and health equity. As such, you will be part of an inspiring and interdisciplinary community of researchers.


  
### **Qualifications and skills**


We are looking for a researcher with strong quantitative skills. Preferably, you have experience with both building and running (micro-)simulation models and the analysis of large data sets. Experience with R (or comparable software) is highly recommended. A background in epidemiology or health economics is beneficial, but anyone with the necessary quantitative skills and an interest in public health and health inequality is invited to apply. A PhD degree is required for this position.

  

 

Before you apply please check our conditions for employment.


  
### **Terms of employment**

  

* You will receive a temporary position for 2 years.
* The gross monthly salary amounts a maximum of € 5.504,- (scale 10).
* Excellent fringe benefits, such as a 13th month that is already paid out in November and a individual travel expense package.
* An International Office which aids you in preparing for you arrival and stay.
* Pension insurance with ABP. We take care of approximately 2/3 of the monthly contribution.
* Special benefits, such as a incompany physiotherapist and bicycle repairer. And there is also a gym where you can work on your fitness after work.

-------------------


Are you looking to shape the future of human-AI collaboration in making important decisions? Join us in this fully funded PhD project! In the next four years, you will conduct scientific research to inform the design of new intelligent systems that excel at not only making decisions but also understand their human users in collaborative decision-making.


Are you looking to shape the future of human-AI collaboration in making important decisions? Join us in this fully funded PhD project! In the next four years, you will conduct scientific research to inform the design of new intelligent systems that excel at not only making decisions but also understand their human users in collaborative decision-making.


The recent developments in AI-assisted decision-making call for an emerging field of human-AI decision-making, i.e., the study of how to improve collaborative decision-making between AI algorithms and human users. Current research in human-AI decision making focuses on technical contributions, such as new algorithms and visualizations that help people understand AI’s decisions by providing explanations (i.e., explainable AI), but overlooks the opposite side of the problem, i.e., how to make AI understand the human decision-maker in the task environment. This is critical in improving the effectiveness and usability of the AI assistance.


In this project, we will explore the possibilities of tracking and inferring users’ mental states through real-time sensory data (e.g., physiological, eye-tracking, movement) and cognitive modeling (i.e., computational modeling of human cognition and decision-making). More specifically, we expect you to (1) study the literature and identify a few decision-making tasks and contexts where our approach has the most potential; (2) build data-driven and/or theory-based user models in the identified contexts of human-AI decision-making; and (3) conduct empirical studies to access the added values of the approach.


As a PhD candidate, you will work in the Human-Technology Interaction group at the Department of Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences. Since the research topic is at the intersection of psychology, human-computer interaction, and AI, you will be supervised by a team of researchers with complementary expertise: Prof. Dr. Chris Snijders (trust in AI, decision-making), Dr. Chao Zhang (human-AI interaction, cognitive modeling), and Dr. Linghan Zhang (signal processing, affective and behavioral computing). Furthermore, you will have access to TU/e’s PhD level courses and training, and are encouraged to collaborate with other researchers at the department and the Eindhoven Artificial Intelligence Systems Institute (EAISI). You are expected to publish your research findings in peer-reviewed journals and at international conferences. The PhD project will conclude a high-quality PhD dissertation on the proposed topic after four years.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* Recently completed (or be close to the completion of) a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction, Cognitive Science, Data Science or a related discipline with demonstrable interest and experience in Psychology [OR] a Master's degree in Psychology or a related field, with demonstrable interest and experience in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
* Demonstrable experience in conducting empirical research with human participants.
* Demonstrable experience with processing complex datasets (e.g., physiological, eye-tracking, sensor data) and applying (state-of-the-art) statistical techniques.
* Strong interest in how people make decisions and how AI can be used to improve decision-making.
* Strong technical skills in programming (e.g., Python, R) and mathematics are a plus.
* Excellent analytical and problem-solving abilities.
* Effective communication skills and the ability to work collaboratively in a diverse, interdisciplinary team.
* Professional proficiency in written and spoken English.

**Conditions of employment**
----------------------------


A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:


* Full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.
* Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the *Collective Labour Agreement* for Dutch Universities, scale P (min. €2,770 max. €3,539).
* A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.

Jouw analyses moeten direct toepasbaar zijn voor collega’s die netten ontwikkelen, strategen, planners van operatie en regioteams met relatiemanagers.


Het energienet van de toekomst maken we voor iedereen, mét iedereen. En als Data-analist Klantvraag werk jij hieraan mee. Zo ben jij bezig met het:

* verzamelen, beheren, prepareren en analyseren van data over onze klanten en de markt. Je stelt samen met collega’s forecasts op en ontwikkelt standaardanalyses en rapportages.
* professionaliseren en optimaliseren van onze klantvraag voorspelling methodiek en het verbinden van korte termijn en lange termijn klantvraag voorspellingen.

Het energielandschap verandert de komende 50 jaar fundamenteel, waarbij duurzame energievoorziening een voorname rol zal spelen. Dit brengt grote uitdagingen met zich mee, ook op de korte termijn. Het is van cruciaal belang om een gedegen en onderbouwd beeld van marktontwikkelingen en (veranderende) klantbehoeften te hebben en dit door te vertalen naar impact op ons werkpakket. Als Marktanalist klantvraag draag je direct bij aan het inzichtelijk maken van de hoeveelheid werk die we als Liander te verzetten hebben op de korte termijn.

  

Als Marktanalist Klantvraag is het belangrijk te weten wat er speelt in de markt. Zo weet jij bijvoorbeeld hoeveel laadpalen en nieuwbouwwoningen er over 2 jaar aangesloten moeten worden op ons elektriciteitsnet. Hiervoor is het van belang om zowel externe als interne informatie op te halen en te analyseren. Korte lijntjes met verschillende bedrijfsonderdelen zoals de operatie, klantstrategie en portfoliomanagement (waar de werkpakketten opgesteld worden) zijn cruciaal. Je signaleert trends en ontwikkelingen in de klantvraag en analyseert samen met collega’s hoe dit zich vertaalt naar door Liander uit te voeren werkzaamheden.


Samen met de data-analisten uit jouw team weet jij de brug te slaan vanuit de analyses en voorspellingen naar de collega’s in de rest van de organisatie. Jullie analyses moeten direct toepasbaar zijn voor collega’s die netten ontwikkelen, strategen, planners van operatie en regioteams met relatiemanagers.


Het energienet van de toekomst maken we voor iedereen, mét iedereen. En als Marktanalist Klantvraag werk jij hieraan mee. Zo ben jij bezig met het:

* Structureel monitoren van markt- en klantinformatie vanuit externe en interne bronnen. Hiervoor onderhoud je korte lijntjes met verschillende teams en afdelingen;
* Uitvoeren van data analyses via Excel en het verzorgen van forecasts en (standaard)rapportages;
* Werken aan team overschrijvende inzichten in een multidisciplinair team t.b.v. het Rollend Plan (o.a. met portfoliomanagement en de operatie) waarbij je als teamspeler fungeert;
* Verbinden van de korte termijn en lange termijn klantvraag voorspellingen;
* Proactief communiceren van conclusies en implicaties, zodat collega’s optimaal gebruik kunnen maken van de verworven kennis;
* Initiatief nemen, zelfstandig onderzoek doen en zowel gevraagd als ongevraagd advies geven aan teamleden, collega’s, het management en andere belanghebbenden.

-------------------


  
Risicogericht en informatiegestuurd toezicht houden op onder meer transport, wonen en onze leefomgeving; dat is wat de Inspectie voor Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT) doet. Als senior analist luchtvaartveiligheid lever jij een belangrijke bijdrage aan onze maatschappij door het analyseren van informatie in meldingen over voorvallen in de luchtvaart. Jij legt verbanden en signaleert risico’s zodat de overheid, de ILT of de luchtvaartbedrijven acties kunnen uitvoeren voor het verbeteren van veiligheid. Deze werkzaamheden verricht je vanuit onze kantoren in Amsterdam Sloterdijk en Utrecht of vanuit huis.



Hoe jij bijdraagt in je rol  

Je gaat werken bij het Analysebureau Luchtvaartvoorvallen (ABL), een specialistische omgeving. Je belangrijkste taak is het analyseren van risico’s. Hiervoor gebruik je de meer dan 20.000 meldingen die het ABL jaarlijks ontvangt en andere data om sterke analyses te maken. Je zoekt naar trends en werkt samen met collega’s om deze te begrijpen. De resultaten presenteer je aan de Toezichtsteams van de ILT en aan sectorpartijen tijdens vergaderingen. De ILT gebruikt deze resultaten om gericht toezicht te houden op de luchtvaart. De informatie van het ABL wordt ook gebruikt om vragen van de media en politiek te beantwoorden. Op Europees niveau werkt het ABL samen met EASA om risico informatie te delen en kennis uit te wisselen.



Als senior analist luchtvaartveiligheid bij de ILT werk je voor de portefeuille Informatie en Programmering. Deze portefeuille geeft richting aan keuzes en uitvoering van het werk van de ILT. We verzamelen informatie en maken informatieproducten voor strategische en tactische besluiten. In de afdeling Data Analyse werken data-engineers, analisten en business consultants. Analisten voeren kwantitatieve analyses uit en doen kwalitatief onderzoek ter ondersteuning. De afdeling levert ook operationele producten, zoals bedrijvenselecties voor toezicht. Het ABL, onderdeel van team Analyse 1, signaleert trends vroegtijdig, zodat betrokken partijen de (vlieg)veiligheid kunnen verbeteren. Nationale en internationale verplichtingen spelen hierbij een rol.



Dit is waar jij voldoening uit haalt  

Je durft met innovatieve ideeën te komen en deze in te brengen op verschillende niveaus. Je vergroot de analysekracht van jouw team en creëert waarde uit meldingen van luchtvaartvoorvallen. Je creëert draagvlak voor veiligheidsinitiatieven bij relevante spelers op operationeel en strategisch niveau, binnen de ILT en in de luchtvaartsector. Je kunt complexe zaken in hun onderlinge samenhang helder uitleggen, vat verschillende standpunten goed samen en zet een helder verhaal uiteen op papier. Je denkt mee met je team over hoe de beschikbare informatie het best benut kan worden om te komen tot conclusies en aanbevelingen. Je werkt methodisch, systematisch en in teamverband.



Geïnteresseerd? Solliciteer direct.  

Of wil je nog wat meer weten over deze functie? Dat kan natuurlijk altijd. Neem vrijblijvend contact op met Erik van Kampen, teamleider van team Analyse 1, via [email protected]. Hij geeft je graag meer info!

Daarnaast ben je je bewust van de (in)formele regels, verschillende posities, ontwikkelingen en gevoeligheden en krachtenvelden in de organisatie en handelt ernaar.

Maak het verschil en solliciteer.


  
jouw uitdaging


Onze onderzoekers kunnen hulp gebruiken bij het automatiseren van hun statistische processen. De huidige applicaties zijn aan herontwikkeling en/of uitbreiding toe.

-------------------


  
**Ideale startersfunctie voor toegepast onderzoek**  

Het deelnemen aan online kansspelen is met ingang van 1 oktober 2021 gelegaliseerd door de wet kansspelen op afstand (KOA). Wij houden toezicht op een nieuwe, internationale markt, die onder andere op het gebied van informatietechnologie sterk verschilt van de markt voor landgebonden kansspelen. Dat doen we risico gestuurd en steeds meer datagedreven: we werken als eerste aan de grootste problemen met de meeste risico’s voor de consument. Cruciaal hiervoor is de informatiepositie van de Kansspelautoriteit.


**Vragen waar jij warm voor loopt zijn:**


*“Hoe zorgen we voor een markt waarin de speler wordt beschermd, kansspelverslaving wordt voorkomen en illegaliteit en criminaliteit wordt bestreden?”*


*“Wat doet de markt zelf al, wat zijn de effecten daarvan en welke interventies zou de Kansspelautoriteit kunnen doen ter bevordering van veilig spelen?”.*



Je signaleert trends en ontwikkelingen met behulp van (markt)analyses. Voor het maken van je analyses maak je gebruik van uiteenlopende soorten data. Je bent in staat om – onder begeleiding - een onderzoeksvraag te formuleren, de nodige bronnen aan elkaar te koppelen, de analyses uit te voeren en de resultaten te presenteren aan je collega’s.


**Wat ga je concreet doen:**


* Je draait mee in (markt)analyses en systematische onderzoeken.
* Je signaleert risico's, problemen en trends, laat relevante ontwikkelingen zien in kwantitatieve analyses.
* Je doet analyse van speelgedrag of gedrag van aanbieders, zowel legaal als illegaal. Denk hierbij aan inzicht vergaren in het naleven van de zorgplicht door kansspelaanbieders, naleving van de reclameregels en de anti witwasregels.
* Je houdt je goed op de hoogte van maatschappelijke en economische ontwikkelingen op jouw vakgebied.
* Je signaleert blinde vlekken in de informatiepositie van de Kansspelautoriteit en doet voorstellen hoe deze te verbeteren.
* Je werkt samen met collega’s met verschillende disciplines en projecten.


**Nieuwsgierig geworden?** Wij nodigen je van harte uit je te laten inspireren en enthousiasmeren:

* Je hebt ervaring met R of Python of vergelijkbaar.
* Je hebt interesse in vraagstukken op het gebied van kansspelen en veilig spelen.
* Je bent analytisch, kritisch en resultaatgericht en doortastend.

**Kansspelautoriteit**
----------------------



De Kansspelautoriteit is onafhankelijk toezichthouder voor de naleving van een veilig kansspelaanbod.

De Kansspelautoriteit hecht daarbij extra aan de belangen van consumenten. Zij moeten veilig kunnen spelen.  

De Kansspelautoriteit informeert en beschermt consumenten tegen onder andere misleidende reclame en helpt kansspelverslaving voorkomen. De Kansspelautoriteit gaat illegale kansspelen tegen, evenals het gebruiken of misbruiken van kansspelen voor criminele activiteiten, waaronder witwassen en aan kansspelen gerelateerde wedstrijdvervalsing. Bovendien behoort het reguleren van een passend legaal aanbod tot een van de kerntaken. Onderdeel van deze taak is het beoordelen en toekennen, dan wel afwijzen van vergunningsaanvragen, het toezien op naleving van wet- en regelgeving door vergunninghouders en het handhavend optreden bij het niet naleven daarvan. De Kansspelautoriteit is ook internationaal actief, samenwerkend met andere toezichthouders op kansspelen, vooral in Europa.

### **Functie inhoud**


Als analist/adviseur Integraal Capaciteitsmanagement ondersteun je het management in verschillende lagen van het ziekenhuis bij de besluitvorming omtrent capaciteitsvraagstukken. Je onderbouwt adviezen met analyses en rapportages over de gehele planningscyclus van patiënten en capaciteiten, zowel op strategisch, tactisch als operationeel niveau. Hiervoor analiseer je data vanuit diverse bronnen om tot adviezen te komen. Zo maken we gebruik van Power BI, SQL en Excel om informatie uit HiX (ziekenhuisinformatiesysteem) en OWS (roostersoftware) te ontsluiten. Mogelijk gaan we in de toekomst ook gebruik maken van specifieke software voor capaciteitsmanagement.  

  

Je bereidt samen met je collega's reguliere capaciteitsmanagementoverleggen voor (zoals scenario-analyses en trendmonitoring), je monitort de wachtlijsten en de capaciteitsbezetting en analyseert eventuele verwachte knelpunten. Je verzorgt hiervoor rapportages en overzichten, creëert scenario's en communiceert deze in begrijpelijke taal naar de gebruikers.  

  

Jouw analyses en adviezen ondersteunen de onderlinge afstemming tussen afdelingen ten behoeve van optimalisatie in de benutting van capaciteiten binnen en tussen afdelingen. Daarnaast adviseer je bij specifieke vraagstukken waarbij capaciteitsmanagement een rol speelt. Hierbij kun je denken aan vraagstukken rondom de indeling van OK-sessies, beschikbare bedden en business cases. Je weet de verschillende partijen te verbinden en de veranderingsbereidheid te activeren.


  
### **Werkomgeving**


In het Erasmus MC werken we hard aan het verbeteren van de zorg van vandaag en de gezondheid van morgen. Baanbrekend werken, grenzen verleggen en vooroplopen. In onderzoek, onderwijs en zorg. We werken met de nieuwste apparatuur, technieken en zorgprocessen in een state-of-the-art gebouw.  

  

Integraal Capaciteitsmanagement (ICM) valt direct onder de Raad van Bestuur.  

  

Als analist/adviseur van de afdeling Integraal Capaciteitsmanagement werk je zowel binnen het Sophia Kinderziekenhuis, als binnen de Centrum Locatie. Bij ICM zijn ook collega-analisten, een datascientist, een HiX adviseur en organisatieadviseurs werkzaam. Je werkt daarnaast nauw samen met collega's van het Sophia, medisch specialisten, managers, HR en Informatiemanagement. Daarnaast werk je met medewerkers die betrokken zijn bij de planning op afdelingen, zoals binnen de klinieken, bureau opname en het operatiecentrum.


  
### **Profiel**


In de functie van analist/adviseur bij de afdeling Integraal Capaciteitsmanagement worden hoge eisen gesteld aan jouw accuratesse, organisatiesensitiviteit en sociale vaardigheden.

**De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie!**

**Wie zoeken wij?**

Voor ons hoofdkantoor in Amersfoort zoeken wij per direct een AI Solutions Developer.

In deze rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verkennen en implementeren van de mogelijkheden van generative AI, zoals ChatGPT, om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren.

Je hebt een relevante WO-opleiding afgerond of bijna afgerond, zoals Informatica of Data Science, en beschikt over aantoonbare kennis en interesse op het gebied van AI, machine learning en data-analyse. Daarnaast heb je sterke analytische vaardigheden en ben je in staat om complexe technische problemen op te lossen. Ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python, R of Java is een vereiste, evenals kennis van cloud computing en ervaring met platforms zoals AWS, Azure of Google Cloud.

Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief samen te werken in een team zijn van essentieel belang. Je bent proactief, leergierig en kunt goed omgaan met veranderingen en uitdagingen. Daarnaast heb je een sterke drive om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en ICT-management.

**Wat ga je doen?**

Deze functie is nieuw binnen Lab21, wat betekent dat je een grote invloed hebt op de invulling ervan. Je zult een onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren. Als Junior ICT Manager speel je een belangrijke rol bij het implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen binnen ons bedrijf. Je werkt nauw samen met verschillende teams om de behoeften van de organisatie in kaart te brengen en technologische oplossingen aan te dragen. Je analyseert en optimaliseert bestaande systemen en processen en identificeert kansen om AI-technologieën toe te passen.

**Plaats in de organisatie:**

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

**Interesse?**

Stuur ons dan je CV met motivatie.

-----------------


Are you interested in wellbeing research and do you have a background in behaviour genetics and/or molecular genetic/multi-omics methodology? Then we are looking for you!


**Project description**  

In light of major demographic trends, building and maintaining health and wellbeing amongst citizens is one of the most important societal challenges countries face. People who feel well, function better, are less susceptible to mental illness, and thus are better able to retain competitive advantage and expand human capital. People who feel well also facilitate social capital by enjoying stronger and more-lasting relationships.


Knowledge on the malleability of wellbeing is essential to facilitate and build wellbeing. While converging evidence reports significant positive effects of wellbeing training, the effects have so far only been studied in single omics designs.


In this project, we, as a team, will go beyond the state of the art by setting up a (gamified) wellbeing training in a multi-omics informative sample, including (epi) genetic, metabolome, and environmental (exposome) data. We will extend traditional randomized control approaches by making optimal use of the unique characteristics of a twin sample, by using identical twins as (nearly) perfect matched controls. We will make, among other datasets, use of data of the Netherlands Twin Register (www.tweelingenregister.org).


**Your profile**
----------------

* A (research) master in biological psychology, positive psychology, genetics, psychometrics, artificial intelligence, epidemiology or something along those lines
* Knowledge of statistical methods and statistical programming (R or Python)
* Experience with or interest in behaviour genetics and molecular genetic/ multi-omics methodology
* Experience in working with large datasets
* Interest in Wellbeing and Research
* Excellent English writing and speaking skills


As a university, we strive for equal opportunities for all, recognising that diversity takes many forms. We believe that diversity in all its complexity is invaluable for the quality of our teaching, research and service. We are always looking for talent with diverse backgrounds and experiences. This also means that we are committed to creating an inclusive community so that we can use diversity as an asset.


**What do we offer?**
---------------------


A challenging position in a socially engaged organisation. At VU Amsterdam, you contribute to education, research and service for a better world. And that is valuable. So in return for your efforts, we offer you:


* a salary of minimum € 2.770,00 (PhD) and maximum € 3.539,00 (PhD) gross per month, on a full-time basis. This is based on UFO profile PhD candidate.

-------------------


  
Hoeveel kinkhoest, mazelen of COVID-19 besmettingen zijn er op dit moment in Nederland? Met jouw data skills help jij mee aan het beantwoorden van deze vragen. Hoe je het ook wendt of keert, werken bij het RIVM is een impactvolle baan.



Wat ga je doen



Als data scientist richt je je op het (adviseren over het) automatiseren van surveillance pipelines binnen het centrum Epidemiologie en Surveillance van Infectieziekten (EPI). Daarbij hoort het scripten van de data transformatie en het vertalen van data naar inzichtelijke outputs volgens de door het team ontwikkelde standaarden. De hiervoor gebruikte surveillance data zijn afkomstig uit verschillende databronnen, bijvoorbeeld meldingen gedaan door de GGD'en, NICE intensive care, ziekenhuis data, Infectieradar en data van de huisartsen peilstations. Een voorbeeld van de output van een geautomatiseerde surveillance pipeline die gebruikt maakt van meerdere van bovenstaande bronnen is griep, kijk op deze website hoe dit eruitziet: https://www.rivm.nl/griep-griepprik/feiten-en-cijfers.



Eén dag per week adviseer je collega’s over het bouwen van hun eigen surveillance pipelines. Een aantal dagen per maand ben je het aanspreekpunt voor technische vragen over de pipelines die binnen het centrum voor surveillance doeleinden worden gebruikt. Op andere dagen ben je zelf bezig met het bouwen en het beheer van pipelines en dashboards en draag je bij aan het efficiënter maken van de pipelines en rapportages. Je bent onderdeel van een gedreven team en levert direct een bijdrage aan het inzichtelijk maken van de beschikbare gegevens.



Verantwoordelijkheden:


* Efficiënte en correcte scripts.
* Ophalen van vraagstukken en deze correct en tijdig beantwoorden.
* Technisch ondersteunen van de epidemiologen.
* Tijdige oplevering rapportages, dashboards en andere outputs.


Uniek aan deze baan



De aard van de werkzaamheden vertoont een innovatief karakter, waardoor er volop gelegenheid is om kennis en expertise op te bouwen op het gebied van R en datastromen. Je neemt deel aan diverse projecten en processen, waarbij de nadruk ligt op het creëren van maatschappelijke relevantie via geavanceerde data science-methoden voor de surveillance van infectieziekten.



Afdeling



Vanuit de afdeling Data, Innovatie en Signalering (DIS) ondersteunen we met 30 medewerkers de rest van het centrum EPI op het gebied van datamanagement en BI, data science en privacy compliance. In totaal werken bij de afdeling DIS meer dan 25 data specialisten - waarvan negen bij het data science team - aan het gereed maken van surveillance data van onder andere de infectieziekten COVID-19, influenza en MPOX.



DIS heeft binnen EPI een centrale rol bij het standaardiseren van de surveillance datastromen van infectieziektes. Veel handmatige en (soms) ad hoc processen worden nu omgezet in gestandaardiseerde en geautomatiseerde processen. Het team werkt aan het (nog) efficiënter inrichten van deze standaarden en aan verdere uitrol binnen EPI. Het team geeft hiervoor advies aan collega’s over het bouwen van hun eigen surveillance pipelines. Het team vertaalt in overleg met epidemiologen deze gegevens naar inzichtelijke tabellen, grafieken, kaarten en rapporten. Deze worden gebruikt als basis voor regionaal, landelijk of internationaal beleid ten aanzien van de bestrijding van infectieziektes. Het team werkt in R (met Tidyverse) voor data pipelines, met GitLab voor version control, met R Markdown voor automatische rapportages en R Shiny voor dashboards.



Daarnaast wordt door middel van text mining data inzichtelijk gemaakt welke de epidemiologen kunnen gebruiken voor het surveillance proces. Op dit moment wordt er met (gen)AI verkent hoe deze technologie kan bijdragen aan onze werkzaamheden. Het team werkt binnen het centrum nauw samen met een team van epidemiologen, datamanagers en onderzoekers en daarbuiten ook met andere (data science) experts van de ICT-organisatie.



De werksfeer binnen ons team is open, vriendelijk, gedreven en nieuwsgierig. Iedereen is druk bezig met uiteenlopende projecten, maar staat toch open voor vragen en springt bij als dit nodig is. Jouw collega’s zijn over het algemeen zeer leergierig; innovatie en nieuwe ideeën worden aangemoedigd. Doordat er binnen dit team niet alleen softwareontwikkeling plaatsvindt, maar ook support en trainingen worden gegeven aan epidemiologen, is het team ook sociaal sterk verbonden met de andere afdelingen. Een goede, ontspannen werksfeer wordt bevorderd door een dagelijkse lunchwandeling in het bos, werkuitjes en borrels. Naast de werkdagen op kantoor (minimaal 2 dagen per week) is er ook ruimte om vanuit huis te werken en zo de privé-werk balans optimaal in te richten.

We are the leading one-stop-shop for branded payments, making online recharge possible for anyone, anywhere at any time — whether you or someone you love needs credit for calling, gaming, entertainment or money. This is your chance to join an ambitious scaleup in a state of rapid growth; we’ll push you to develop yourself and help you create a real impact in your role. Put simply: we could write history together.

  

We won’t bore you with a corporate spiel about how we might be taking on the world of branded payments (spoiler: we are).



Instead, we’ll let the numbers speak for themselves: we bring consumers their favourite brands to their fingertips, with over 15,000 products available in every gift card category globally, $70 million in funding (and counting!), 20%+ growth in 2023.

  

We also have a revenue target of €75 million in 2024, we're just getting started with 1.1 million app downloads in 2023, we are counting 5.0+ million active customers, a presence in 180 countries and 25 markets, a team of 150+ employees and 40+ nationalities and 1 person missing — you.

  


We’re on the hunt for the hungriest and most passionate talent out there. If at any point your brain screams “I want in!” while you’re reading this, then consider this the sign you’ve been looking for: we want you too.

  

**The role**



We’re looking for a talented Business Analyst to join our Business Intelligence Team reporting to Nicolas Arrivé. You will work on improving our day to day business with a strong focus on our customers and marketing analytics.

  

You understand what kind of insights drive the right action. You have great analytical skills and are good at making people understand what needs to get done and why.  



  

The BI team embeds actionable insights into the business teams and drives commercial success (improving sales, margin and/or efficiency). Automation is also at the heart of our business practices when value can be extracted at scale.

 **What will I do?**



As a Senior Business Analyst you will play a vital part in defining our Marketing, customer base and product strategy.



You own relationships with Recharge directors and C-level executives, and therefore you are capable of articulating complex analytical or data topics into simple concepts to senior audiences.



You can articulate the positive business impact of your recommendations and insights.

  

You perform ad hoc advanced strategic analyses and provide the insights that help Customer, Marketing and Product teams improve the service(s) that Recharge offers and/or improve the commercial value for Recharge and our customers.


You are a de-facto code reviewer for the rest of the team for the code base you are the most proficient with.

  

You are proactively making the right trade-off between self-service analytics environments (Tableau reporting) and custom deliverables.

  

For example, we are working on a strategy to keep and nurture our most loyal customer base. We are working on strategies to win back customers who have churned within the previous 12 months. We help the Marketing team in being more efficient with their Marketing spend in acquiring the right customers. We also inform our product and engineering teams in optimising the users experience from discovery to purchases in app and on the web.

 **What you have:**


* 5+ years experience in an analytics and/or data-science related field (preferably within the e-commerce industry)
* 5+ years experience working with structured and unstructured data-sets as well as data extraction tools such as Hive and/or SQL
* Solid understanding of testing and modelling statistics (R2, p-value, t-test etc…)
* 1+ year experience with statistical software such as R, or coding language: Python
* 5+ years Experience with Data Visualisation tools (like Tableau and Power BI ideally)
* Hands-on experience with setting up test studies: A/B tests, Geo-experimentation and Lift studies

 **Nice to have:**


* Knowledge of analytics platforms, such as Google Analytics
* Advanced knowledge of Customer, Marketing Analytics and modelling such as price elasticity test and formula, Marketing Mix Models, LifeTime Value calculations etc…
* Bachelor’s degree in Business, Statistics, Data Science, Economics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, Sociology or similar
* Advanced knowledge of Python or R

 **What we offer**


* 30 days of holiday, a great pension scheme, and one of the best relocation packages in Amsterdam
* Flexible working hours and an office overlooking the Amstel
* Macbook Pro or Windows Laptop
* Budget for noise-cancelling headphones, travel to and from the office, working-from-home and self-learning
* Free healthy breakfast, lunch and snacks by our in-house chef
* Free Dutch classes to help out with daily life in the Netherlands
* Regular parties, celebrations and other events

At Recharge we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

 **The process**


**1. Apply**: Want in? Let us know! Apply for a role and help us get to know your best self

**3. First interview**: You’ll meet with your future line manager (either in person or online) to talk about you, our culture and whether you're a fit for the job


**4. Assignment & Second interview**: Some roles involve a case study. Great! It’s your chance to shine and show us you have what it takes. You’ll present your case study to the Hiring Manager and someone from the team


**5. Third Interview**: You’ll meet with a key member of the Management Team


**6. Offer**: You did it! There are only a few tickets available, and this one has your name on it. Welcome to the team.",r,https://recharge.recruitee.com/o/business-analyst-3?source=Indeed,,,,,,,,,,,16be50839ad54284,,en

-------------------


  
Wil jij verandering brengen in een van de grootste maatschappelijke uitdagingen van dit moment? Het ministerie van BZK/VRO werkt aan een goede volkshuisvesting, waarin iedereen een woning kan vinden die bij hem of haar past. Op dit moment is het voor veel mensen nog lastig om een betaalbare en passende woning te vinden. Daarom is het van groot belang dat ons beleid goed werkt en goed is onderbouwd. En daar kun jij als senior beleidsonderzoeker corporatiedata aan meewerken!


We zoeken een nieuwe collega voor de afdeling Kennis bij directie Wonen van BZK/VRO. Onze afdeling draagt bij aan het vormgeven en verbeteren van het woonbeleid. Dat doen we onder andere door het uitvoeren van beleidsanalyses en doorrekeningen t.b.v. (nieuw) beleid en het datamanagement van de basisonderzoeken en statistieken die nodig zijn voor deze analyses. Hiervoor hebben we een schat aan data tot onze beschikking. We verzorgen (opdrachtgevend) relatiebeheer met onderzoeksbureaus en (internationale) kennisinstellingen. Verder doet Kennis aan strategische beleidsadvisering en dragen we bij aan de monitoring van de voortgang van de Nationale Woon- en Bouwagenda en de Nationale Prestatieafspraken met woningcorporaties. De afdeling Kennis opereert als een spin in het web van de informatievoorziening en werkt continu samen met de andere afdelingen en directies. Daarbij ligt de nadruk sterk op het delen van relevante kennis en inzichten gericht op beleidsontwikkeling.


Bij de afdeling Kennis hebben we voor de senior beleidsonderzoekers twee profielen, namelijk één met een focus op de rol van onderzoeker i.c.m. kennismakelaar en de ander met meer nadruk op de rol van onderzoeker i.c.m. data-analist. De nu vacante functie betreft die tweede rol en dan specifiek gericht op data, analyse en monitoring op het gebied van de woningcorporatiesector.


Als senior beleidsonderzoeker corporatiedata bij de afdeling Kennis:

* werk je aan de gehele informatievoorziening rondom woningcorporaties. Het gaat om het proces van de jaarlijkse prognose- en verantwoordingsinformatie (dPi en dVi) over de activiteiten en de financiële positie van corporaties. Je werkt hiervoor nauw samen met de collega-afdeling Corporaties en binnen het samenwerkingsverband SBR-Wonen met de Autoriteit Woningcorporaties (Aw), Aedes en Waarborgfonds Sociale Woningbouw (WSW);
* word je namens BZK het aanspreekpunt binnen het samenwerkingsverband. Dit betekent dat je deelneemt aan het tactisch overleg, bepaal je mede de monitoringswensen rondom de corporatiesector en coördineer je de analyses t.b.v. kwaliteitsbewaking. Ook draag je bij aan het organiseren van een goede structuur, financiering en (data)governance m.b.t. AVG, doorleveringen, opslag en verwerking;
* vertaal je (beleids)vraagstukken van Corporaties en andere collega-afdelingen naar (data) onderzoeksvragen en voer je zelf analyses uit t.b.v. beleidsontwikkeling. Ook verzorg je afstemming met en opdrachtverlening aan datapartners en onderzoeksbureaus over projectvoorstellen, offertes en (samenwerkings)overeenkomsten;
* zorg je voor het uitbouwen van het Dashboard Prestatie Woningcorporaties In Kaart (PWIK), inclusief de jaarlijkse Indicatieve Bestedingsruimte Woningcorporaties (IBW) en andere monitors, waaronder de Monitor Besluit Toegelaten Instellingen Volkshuisvesting (BTiV);
* word je namens de afdeling thematrekker van het kennisdossier woningcorporaties en ben je daarmee een belangrijke schakel tussen de afdelingen Kennis en Corporaties. Je werkt vanuit Kennis mee aan het verbeteren van het beleid gericht op de corporatiesector.

  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
Je bent onze ideale kandidaat als je kennis hebt van de corporatiesector i.r.t. data en onderzoek. Dus we vragen veel, maar geen enkel mens is een duizendpoot. Je hoeft echt niet op*alle*onderdelen even hoog te scoren. Als jij jezelf herkent in onderstaand profiel, dan horen we graag van je:

* Je hebt minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring met het uitvoeren van complex kwantitatief en kwalitatief onderzoek en het opzetten en aansturen van datagedreven projecten;
* Je bouwt aan relaties, zowel intern als met externe organisaties. Je communiceert daarbij gemakkelijk op verschillende niveaus, met oog voor verschillende belangen;
* Je kan zelfstandig (data) analyses uitvoeren en deze helder opschrijven en presenteren;
* Je bent goed thuis in pakketten als SPSS en/of R en je deelt jouw kennis hierover graag met de afdeling;


Pluspunten (maar wat je bij ons ook gaandeweg nog mag ontwikkelen) zijn als je je makkelijk beweegt in een politiek sensitieve omgeving, je specifieke kennis en ervaring hebt met financieel-economische vraagstukken die relevant is voor de woningcorporatiesector en je over stevige adviesvaardigheden beschikt.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



Het ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties (BZK) werkt aan brede maatschappelijke en politieke opgaven, bijvoorbeeld aan een efficiënte bouw- en woningmarkt en één effectieve rijksdienst met een efficiënt functionerende bedrijfsvoering. Zo zijn we ook verantwoordelijk voor efficiënt beheer en ontwikkeling van het rijksvastgoed en een goede ontwikkeling van bestuurders en ambtenaren. We beschermen de nationale veiligheid en waarborgen de grondwet en koninkrijksrelaties. BZK is de hoeder van de democratie.


De directie Wonen is binnen het ministerie van BZK verantwoordelijk voor beleid en regelgeving voor de huursector, de woningcorporaties en de koopmarkt. De directie is onderverdeeld in zes afdelingen die onderling nauw samenwerken: Kennis, Huurbeleid, Huurtoeslag, Inkomensondersteuning en Caribisch Nederland, Aandachtsgroepen, Corporaties en Koop- en Kapitaalmarkt. Het beleid rond wonen staat politiek en maatschappelijk sterk in de aandacht en dat heeft zijn weerslag op het werk bij de directie. Het werk kenmerkt zich door een grote dynamiek, gedreven door actualiteit en met veel contacten met partijen in de samenleving en binnen de Rijksoverheid.


De afdeling Kennis versterkt de onderbouwing en monitoring van huidig en toekomstig beleid. Kennis vatten we breed op: van het onderhouden en verbeteren van de informatievoorziening (o.a. Woonbase, WoON, Datawonen.nl, samenwerking met partijen als Kadaster, CBS en ABF) tot het netwerken met en aansturen van planbureaus, universiteiten en (inter)nationale instellingen. De afdeling Kennis coördineert de integrale voortgangsrapportageStaat van de Volkshuisvesting(met bijbehorendepubliciteit), de ontwikkeling van dashboards, deelname aan IBO’s, beleidsdoorlichting en strategische beleidsontwikkeling en de directiebrede onderzoeksagenda wonen.



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.

Wil jij helpen onze bodem te beschermen tegen schadelijke effecten van chemische stoffen zoals zware metalen en PFAS? Je komt bij ons terecht in een gespecialiseerd team dat op een laagdrempelige en open manier met elkaar omgaat en voor elkaar klaar staat. Daarnaast betekent werken bij de overheid ook mooie arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een dertiende maand, een goed geregeld pensioen en volledige reiskostenvergoeding als je met het ov reist. Benieuwd wat deze functie jou te bieden heeft? Lees verder!



Dit ga je doen  

Je bent als onderzoeker op het gebied van chemische stoffen in bodem en ondergrond een verbindende factor tussen onze experts. Je werkt in team Bodem dat bestaat uit zo’n tien collega’s, allen specialisten op verschillende thema’s als ecologie, hydrologie of toxicologie. Je gebruikt jouw kennis van modellen over het gedrag van chemische stoffen om de impact van het gebruik van bouw- en reststoffen in de bodem op bodem en ondergrond in te schatten. Je kunt hierbij denken aan de gevolgen van uitspoeling van stoffen als metalen uit materialen zoals staalslakken of schuimglas.



Daarnaast wordt het relatief onbekende transportgedrag van verschillende PFAS in de ondergrond door jou modelmatig verkend en worden de risico’s onderzocht voor het drinkwater in Nederland. De door jou ontwikkelde kennis is nodig voor het maken van ruimtelijke afwegingen voor bodem en ondergrond en het waarborgen van een gezonde leefomgeving.



Dit doe jij:


* Je bent inhoudelijk specialist bij het berekenen van uitloging en verspreiding van chemische stoffen. Deze stoffen kunnen vrijkomen mede als gevolg van circulaire economie of door diffuus vervuilde gebieden in Nederland;
* Je bent betrokken bij het gebruik en het verder ontwikkelen van modellen voor bodemtransport en uitloging en je past de modellen toe in de praktijk;
* Jouw modelkennis van uitloging en transport wordt gevraagd in de monitoring en risicobeoordeling van bestaande en opkomende stoffen, ‘chemicals of emerging concern’. Nieuwe probleemstoffen zijn vaak mobiel en persistent en komen daardoor in de ondergrond en het grondwater terecht;
* Je werkt mee aan integratie van kennis over gedrag van chemische stoffen in het bodem-water systeem;
* Je licht jouw onderzoeksresultaten toe in rapportages voor onze opdrachtgevers.


Je werkt geregeld aan meerdere projecten tegelijk en krijgt binnen de kaders van jouw onderzoeksopdracht de ruimte om zelf na te denken over onderzoeksmethoden en daarmee creatief te zijn in het beantwoorden van de vraag. Bij het ene onderzoek ben je meer bezig met modelleren, in het andere onderzoek kijk je juist naar de samenhang tussen wetenschap en beleid. Je werkt aan projecten die de nodige aandacht krijgen vanuit beleid en maatschappij, dit maakt het een interessant, relevant en dynamisch werkveld.



Uniek aan deze baan  

In deze functie krijg je de kans om jouw wetenschappelijke kennis verder te ontwikkelen en toe te passen op uitdagende en maatschappelijke relevante vraagstukken. Je werkt met veel partijen interdisciplinair samen zowel binnen als buiten het RIVM. Je teamgenoten zijn intrinsiek gedreven collega’s, samen maken jullie impact en werken jullie aan nieuwe wetenschappelijke methodes en inzichten voor een groene, gezonde en duurzame leefomgeving.



Omdat jouw team uit verschillende disciplines bestaat, is er ruimte om in de diepte op vraagstukken in te gaan en kun je veel leren van je collega’s. We zijn een groep met een laagdrempelige en open cultuur en zien elkaar met de rest van de afdeling erbij ook regelmatig voor leuke activiteiten, zoals een middagje zeilen of een excursie naar een natuurgebied.



Je krijgt bij ons voldoende mogelijkheid om over zowel de inhoud te sparren, zoals met je teamleden uit de projecten waarin je werkt, als op persoonlijk gebied, zoals met je manager of een buddy.



Dit wordt jouw afdeling  

Bij het RIVM werken we met ruim 2500 collega’s elke dag samen aan de zorg van morgen. Je komt terecht op onze afdeling Duurzame Bodem, Drinkwater en Biodiversiteit, waar je in verschillende teams werkt aan de ontwikkeling van methoden en modellen voor de risicobeoordeling van stoffen. Onder andere voor de opgaven voor de kwaliteit van bodem en grondwater. We adviseren alle overheidslagen over bodembeleidsontwikkeling en –uitvoering. We werken in opdracht van ministeries en overheden, samen met andere kennisinstellingen en maatschappelijke organisaties aan een veilig, gezond en duurzaam gebruik van bodem en ondergrond.



Meer informatie  

Heb je interesse in deze positie, maar eerst nog wat vragen? Bel gerust met afdelingshoofd Theo Traas (06-4686 0947) of met onze recruiter Michelle van de Beurcht (06-460 75 150).


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
Dit neem je mee  

Dit is een functie waarbij je met veel verschillende disciplines samenwerkt, daarom is het nodig dat je je kunt verplaatsen in de problematiek van de probleemhebbers. We werken veel in teamverband, daarom verwachten we dat je, naast dat je goed zelfstandig kunt werken, ook een prettige collega bent.



Verder vragen wij:


* Je hebt een afgeronde wetenschappelijke opleiding zoals bodemkunde, hydrologie, milieukunde of aanverwant. In je studie heb je gewerkt aan grondwaterkwaliteit of bodemfuncties of je bent in staat om vanuit je opleiding een logische brug hiernaar te slaan. Door jouw studie heb je ook aantoonbare kennis van het gedrag van stoffen in het milieu en daarop gebaseerde risicobeoordeling;
* Daarbij heb je kennis van data-analyse en visualisatie met de door het RIVM gebruikte programmeertalen Python of R;
* Je hebt ervaring opgedaan in het doen van onderzoek, het geven van toelichtingen en het leveren van bijdragen aan publicaties. Dit kan ook tijdens je opleiding zijn geweest;
* Je hebt affiniteit met milieuchemische bodemmodellen en hebt ervaring met of bent bereid je te verdiepen in het model HYDRUS-1D. Kennis van ORCHESTRA is een pre;
* Je spreekt en schrijft goed Nederlands. Veel wetenschappelijke literatuur is in het Nederlands en je hebt regelmatig contact met organisaties buiten het RIVM, waar Nederlands voor nodig is. Ook is veel wetenschappelijke literatuur in het Engels, daarom is een goed begrip van Engels ook nodig voor deze functie.

Bij HDSR werken we samen aan schoon en voldoende water. Goede informatie vormt de basis van ons werk. Op basis van jouw ordening en analyse van data en tijdreeksen kunnen wij zorgen voor een goed functionerend watersysteem.


Als Databeheerder Monitoring Waterkwantiteit en Waterkwaliteit zorg je ervoor dat de ruwe data wordt omgezet in betrouwbare en relevante waterinformatie. Dit doen wij voor interne vraagstukken, maar ook voor die van inwoners van ons gebied. Een voorbeeld hiervan is een agrariër die meer inzicht wil krijgen in de werking van een stuw. Die kan nu op ons Open Water Data-portaal opzoeken of hij voldoende water heeft in tijden van droogte en geen wateroverlast krijgt tijdens hevige neerslag. Jij verzamelt data, monitort dit, maakt het inzichtelijk en ontsluit het via webservices. Daarbij zijn de historische tijdreeksen in de FEWS-datasystemen essentieel. Het waterbeheer in ons gebied is uitdagend door de diversiteit aan bodemtypes (veen, klei, zand). Dit maakt jouw werk afwisselend bij de beoordeling van de datakwaliteit.

Current statistical methodology still reflects the use-context of its first development in the 1920s: methods assume that researchers make all important analysis choices before gathering the data. In modern data science age, however, data-driven paradigms have become dominant: many measurements are gathered simultaneously and it is often natural to pursue research questions that were not of obvious interest a priori. Looking at the data is scientifically sensible to do, but the problem is that current statistical methods cannot handle this behaviour well. What is needed for this, is the right mathematical framework, that gives the necessary error control guarantees without all the old restrictive assumptions. In this PhD project you will develop such mathematical foundations by bringing together exciting novel developments in mathematical statistics and machine learning theory, among which: closed testing, bandits, and the new theory of hypothesis testing with e-values, co-developed by your supervisor Dr. Rianne de Heide.



You will:


* Perform daily PhD-level research
* Publish results in journals and conference proceedings, and present these at (inter)national workshops and conferences.
* Contribute to teaching activities related to your work.
* Be a part of an excellent young research group, and benefit from frequent (virtual) interaction with other internationally renowned research groups working on e-values, such as at CWI (Amsterdam), LUMC (Leiden) and in the US.

We are an inclusive group and diversity is at the heart of our research principles. We care about a good working atmosphere and a good work-life balance. Applications from all groups currently under-represented in academic posts are especially encouraged. We particularly encourage women and people from minority groups to apply.


### **Your profile**

* You have, or will shortly acquire a master degree in (applied) mathematics or a related degree with a strong theoretical mathematical component. Enthusiasm for the topic of the project is more important than your choice of specialization in your master’s.
* You have excellent proficiency in English in speaking and writing (C1; above IELTS 7 or equivalent)..
* Scientific programming skills are a plus, e.g. in R, Python, C++, Julia, etc.
### **Our offer**

* As a PhD candidate at UT, you will be appointed to a full-time position for four years, with a qualifier in the first year, within a very stimulating and exciting scientific environment;
* The University offers a dynamic ecosystem with enthusiastic colleagues;
* Your salary and associated conditions are in accordance with the collective labour agreement for Dutch universities (CAO-NU);
* You will receive a gross monthly salary ranging from € 2.770,- (first year) to € 3.539,- (fourth year);
* There are excellent benefits including a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%, and a solid pension scheme;
* The flexibility to work partially from home;
* A minimum of 232 leave hours in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A full-time employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.
* Free access to sports facilities on campus
* A family-friendly institution that offers parental leave (both paid and unpaid);
* You will have a training programme as part of the Twente Graduate School where you and your supervisors will determine a plan for a suitable education and supervision;
* We encourage a high degree of responsibility and independence, while collaborating with close colleagues, researchers and other staff.
### **Information and application**



Are you interested in this position? Please send your application via the '' button below **before August 1** and include:


* A cover letter (maximum 2 pages A4), emphasizing your specific interest, qualifications, motivations to apply for this position.
* A Curriculum Vitae, including a list of all courses attended and grades obtained, and, if applicable, a list of publications.
* Contact information of two references who we may contact.
* Your master’s thesis, or in case it is not yet completed, one other document written in English of which you are the main author. This can be a publication, a term paper, or anything else that you wrote and consider relevant.

The interviews are scheduled for **19 Augustus 2024**. If you are not available on this day, please indicate so in your application letter.

Bij CBR kun je zelfstandig werken als schakel tussen IT en de business.**Jouw uitdaging**
------------------

**Jouw uitdaging**  

In deze rol ligt de focus op data-analyse en ondersteuning van de verschillende divisies op het gebied van KPI's, dashboards en alles wat te maken heeft met de stroom van cijfers. CBR is volop in beweging en investeert in een nieuwe IT-infrastructuur. Als business partner en data-analist ben je sterk in het begrijpen van operationele processen en het omgaan met de grote datastromen die daaruit voortkomen. Verder houd je je bezig met het identificeren, analyseren en specificeren van de informatiebehoeften van de business. Je analyseert de gegevens en verwerkt deze tot dashboards, analyses en informatie.* De informatiebehoeften afstemmen met de business en de functionele specificaties overdragen aan de BI-ontwikkelaar.

**Hoe ziet een werkdag van Iris als Senior Data Analist eruit?**  

Mijn werkdag als analist bij CBR begint altijd met een dagstart met de andere analisten. Hierin bespreken we de stand van zaken met betrekking tot de huidige sprint, of we ergens tegenaan lopen en proberen samen oplossingen te bedenken.  

  

Een werkdag als analist bij CBR is eigenlijk nooit hetzelfde. Een dag vult zich met het voeren van gesprekken met de business, het uitwerken van eerder ingediende dataverzoeken vanuit de business, ad hoc data-analyses en het helpen/meedenken met de andere business analisten.  

Het is daarbij belangrijk om de prioriteiten goed in te schatten en een planning te maken, zodat alles op tijd afkomt. Soms is het wel even schakelen tussen alle verschillende afdelingen en processen, maar dit maakt het werken bij CBR extra leuk en interessant.

* Adoptie bij klanten bevorderen door middel van expertsessies, workshops en trainingen.


**Jouw Profiel**  




We zoeken collega’s die houden van uitdaging en diversiteit. Elke opdracht is uniek. Als consultant ben je niet alleen bekend met verschillende architecturen en technieken, maar herken je ook patronen bij verschillende klanten, waardoor je de kennis en ervaring die je bij de ene klant hebt opgedaan kunt toepassen bij de andere.  

Verder zoeken wij in jou het volgende:


* Je bent nieuwsgierig. In plaats van letterlijk te doen wat er van je gevraagd wordt denk je verder. Je wil het daadwerkelijke probleem, de wensen en behoeftes begrijpen en baseert op die kennis jouw oplossing;
* Het is belangrijk dat je de klant kan meenemen in jouw verhaal en de klant kan begeleiden op basis van het principe “voordoen, samendoen, zelf doen”;
* Als Power BI consultant ben je veel in contact met de business en ben je goed in het managen van stakeholders. Je verstopt je niet achter het scherm – JIJ bent het aanspreekpunt voor zowel de business/stakeholders als ontwikkelaars;
* Je werkt op een georganiseerde en gestructureerde manier, want datamodellen en rapportages zonder structuur en consistentie zijn erg moeilijk te lezen en te begrijpen.


 Daarnaast vragen we:


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus.
* Je hebt al 3-5 jaar werkervaring opgedaan in dit vakgebied in soortgelijke rol.
* Je hebt diepgaande kennis in Power BI / Microsoft Fabric. Je begrijpt hoe je data efficiënt kunt laden en transformeren met M, hoe je een datamodel kunt bouwen en hoe je performante functies in DAX kunt schrijven;
* Idealiter heb je het PL300 – Power BI Data Analyst Associate certificaat. Een DP600 certificering is een pluspunt;
* SQL-kennis is geen vereiste, maar zal enorm van pas komen bij het analyseren van de data;
* Kennis van externe tools zoals Tabular Editor en DAX Studio is een pluspunt, net als ervaring met PowerShell en REST API;
* Ervaring in het geven van Power BI trainingen en het implementeren van Power BI best practices omtrent data modelleren en rapporteren;
* Kennis van en ervaring met het inrichten van een Power BI tenant op basis van Power BI Governance richtlijnen;
* Je bent bereid om af en toe naar de klant te reizen.

**Het Team**



Je maakt deel uit van een sterk team met verschillende Power BI-consultants, sprekers en evangelisten (Microsoft MVP) die het maximale uit Power BI (en Fabric) willen halen. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.

Met jouw expertise in Python en cloudsystemen werk je nauw samen met jouw collega's in Team POWER om de werkprocessen te optimaliseren en te stroomlijnen, waardoor aanzienlijke efficiëntiewinst gerealiseerd kan worden. Team POWER (Planning Operational Work Efficiently & Realistically) geeft datagedreven adviezen en doet voorspellingen om zo meer productie, betrouwbaarheid, voorspelbaarheid en flow te brengen in de voorbereiding van cases. Het doel van POWER is om een prognose te geven van doorlooptijden in de GV/R&N voorbereidingsfase en daarmee de Geplande Start Uitvoering (GSU) te voorspellen. Om een goede voorspelling te doen dient veel data samen gebracht te worden. Deze verzamelde data geven we direct aan de Engineer terug d.m.v. onze QuickScan. In onze QuickScan krijgt de Engineer in het begin van de voorbereiding in één oogopslag een overzicht van alle omgevings- en projectvariabelen die een rol spelen bij een case in de voorbereiding. Hiermee komen risico’s vroegtijdig in beeld, wordt vertraging voorkomen en kunnen we beter plannen met onze stakeholders en partners. Het energienet van de toekomst maken we voor iedereen, mét iedereen. En als Data Science Software Engineer werk jij hieraan mee. Zo ben jij bezig met het:

* Ontwikkelen en onderhouden van softwareoplossingen en tools voor dataverzameling, -analyse en -visualisatie.
* Meedraaien in een innovatief en groeiend Scrum DevOps team.
* Implementeren en onderhouden van AI modellen, optimalisatie-algoritmen en andere analytische toepassingen.
* Bevorderen van het toepassen van testautomatisering in Agile teams, waar dit toegevoegde waarde biedt t.o.v. handmatig testen.
* Beheren en onderhouden van de cloudomgeving en deployment pipeline.
* Delen van kennis door middel van samenwerking en kennissessies.


Met jouw bijdragen bouwen we aan een slimmer en efficiënter energienet dat klaar is voor de toekomst.

Hierbij staan data en voorspellingen centraal. Wij voorspellen de meest optimale planning van projecten en monitoren doorlooptijden. Door optimalisatie van alle projectplanningen samen, kan het werk met een goede flow uitgevoerd worden. Wij verzamelen en combineren hiervoor data uit verschillende bronnen, zoals werktekeningen, vergunningen, geografische factoren en levertijden, zodat het werk slimmer kan worden gedaan en we betrouwbaarder worden in onze planning richting bijvoorbeeld klanten, monteurs en aannemers.

-------------------


  
Ben jij een (ervaren) business analist met een passie voor de gezondheidszorg? Wil je bijdragen aan het verbeteren van een aantal belangrijke preventieprogramma’s in Nederland? Dan is het RIVM op zoek naar jou!



Wat ga je doen?



Als business analist bij het RIVM binnen de Dienst Vaccinvoorziening en Preventieprogramma’s (DVP) draag jij bij aan het optimaliseren van de uitvoering van een aantal belangrijke preventieprogramma’s die bijdragen aan de volksgezondheid. Je werkt intensief samen met onder andere product owners, architecten, business analisten, informatiemanagers en functioneel ontwerpers.



Zodra er vanuit de business een vraag voor een analyse of potentiële wijziging komt, maak je samen met de stakeholders en verschillende collega’s de vertaling van de inhoudelijke vraag naar passende (IT) oplossingen. Je brengt de impact van de mogelijke functionele wijzigingen op het proces in kaart en vertaalt dat naar oplossingen, die door de Agile Release Train (ART) opgepakt kunnen worden. Dit kan inhouden dat je processen uitwerkt, requirements analyse uitvoert of bijvoorbeeld een impact- / risico analyse of Plan van Aanpak (PvE) maakt. Hierbij houd je de ontwikkelingen binnen de organisatie nauwlettend in de gaten.



Daarnaast maak je procesbeschrijvingen en werk je gezamenlijk aan de totstandkoming en actualisatie van de procesarchitectuur en het procesmodel. Je gaat actief op zoek naar informatie bij de betrokkenen, zodat je processen kan opstellen en verbeteren. Je blijft hierbij kritisch. De focus ligt op het inrichten, vastleggen, verbeteren en borgen van (bedrijfs)processen en bijbehorende informatiestromen. Je denkt mee over de waarde die wijzigingen opleveren voor het primaire proces. Daarnaast kom je proactief met verbetervoorstellen voor je eigen werkwijze en de werkwijze binnen je team en de ART.



Werkzaamheden en taken:


* Het specificeren, prioriteren, verifiëren en valideren van functionele wensen en eisen en het vertalen hiervan naar efficiënte oplossingen.
* Het signaleren van risico's, knelpunten en afwijkingen in processen en werkwijze (en zo nodig adviseren om deze weg te nemen).
* Maken van procesbeschrijvingen en bijdragen aan de procesarchitectuur en het procesmodel.
* Het optreden als klankbord voor de business, scrum team(s) en/of leverancier(s).


Uniek aan deze baan



Je komt te werken in een maatschappelijk betrokken en ambitieuze organisatie met vooruitstrevende doelen, waar geen dag hetzelfde is. Veel van onze programma’s zijn uniek, zoals de hielprikscreening. Daaraan lever jij actief een bijdrage.



Je bent in de hele organisatie aanwezig en komt in aanraking met verschillende disciplines. Je wordt van alle kanten bevraagd en bent betrokken bij veel programma’s.



Waar de functie het toelaat bieden we jou de ruimte om tijd- en plaats onafhankelijk te werken.



De zorg voor morgen begint vandaag



Wil jij bijdragen als Business Analist? Dan horen we graag van jou. Heb je nog vragen of wil je meer weten over de rol of over het RIVM? Bel of app dan gerust met Georget van den Burg, afdelingshoofd BIS (06-15863252).

✔️ Jij bent de spil tussen de klant en het development team



✔️ De wens van de klant weet je écht te achterhalen en vertalen naar (functionele) requirements



✔️ Je staat centraal in het ontwikkelproces van en bij de klant

 **De vraag achter de vraag herkennen**  

Onze klanten hebben te maken met complexe uitdagingen waarbij jouw expertise als senior informatie analist essentieel is. Hoewel je geen developer bent, heb je begrip van de technische mogelijkheden. Daarnaast heb je ook een grondige kennis van data: je bent in staat om informatiebehoeften te vertalen naar datamodellen.  



  

Als senior informatie analist werk je samen met een multidisciplinair scrumteam aan uiteenlopende projecten bij onze klanten in de segmenten overheid, maritiem en verzekeringen. In deze teams werk je nauw samen met Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Developers, Testers en andere senior analisten zoals Alexander en Wim.

  

Jij zorgt ervoor dat we niet alleen voldoen aan de klantwensen, maar ook daadwerkelijk bieden wat de klant nodig heeft. Dit doe je door mee te denken met de klant, hun uitdagingen volledig te doorgronden en zo de onderliggende vragen te identificeren. Vervolgens weet je die te vertalen naar geavanceerde (functionele) ontwerpen.

  

Als je na een aantal jaren toe bent aan nieuwe uitdagingen, dan zijn er voldoende doorgroeimogelijkheden binnen Garansys en de Caesar Groep, zoals Business Consultancy en Projectmanagement. Bij Garansys geloven we dat het combineren van allround- en T-shaped vaardigheden je niet alleen breder inzetbaar maakt, maar ook meerwaarde biedt voor onze klanten. Als Senior Informatie Analist wordt je regelmatig betrokken om met Sales op te trekken om klanten te overtuigen dat wij hun problemen begrijpen en daar oplossingen voor kunnen bieden. Kortom; jij bent de sleutel tot het leveren van waardevolle dienstverlening die onze klanten echt verder helpen.

 **Je maakt ons blij met:**



Je bent een zelfstarter en kunt zelfstandig werken, maar acteert toch het beste in een team. Jij bent de belangrijkste schakel tussen de gebruiker en het Agile team. Je schakelt snel en vertaalt de wens van de klant naar passende (maatwerk)oplossingen die écht waarde toevoegen.  



  

Jouw sterkte ligt in het luisteren naar, en kritische vragen stellen over de wens van de klant. Deze wens komt tot uiting in een duidelijk functioneel- en database ontwerp. Je legt dit vast in requirements voor het development team. Jij weet daarvoor op diverse niveaus binnen een organisatie te communiceren en vindt het geen probleem om hierbij meerdere klanten tegelijk te bedienen. Jij start de conversatie met de klant en eindigt deze ook; je bent namelijk van het begin tot het einde betrokken bij het ontwikkelproces.

  

Verder heb je:


* Een HBO/WO diploma binnen een relevante opleiding, zoals Business IT & Management of HBO-ICT;
* Uitstekende beheersing van de Nederlandse én Engelse taal zowel schriftelijk als mondeling;
* Minimaal 5 jaar werkervaring als informatie analist, met aantoonbaar succesvolle IT-projecten;
* Ervaring met een scrum/agile manier van werken;
* Ervaring met het werken in multidisciplinaire teams en met een diversiteit aan stakeholders.


Je werkt in deze functie tussen de 32-40 uur. Eigen indeling van jouw werkdagen behoort tot de mogelijkheden. Het is in deze functie niet handig om veel thuis te werken. Je overlegt namelijk met je teams op kantoor en bezoekt ook regelmatig klanten.

 **Hier word jij blij van:**



Je wil jouw ervaring graag uitbreiden in een dynamische werkomgeving, waarin je vrijheid hebt om je eigen groeipad in te richten. Jouw ontwikkeling als persoon en professional staat bij ons centraal.  



  

Op basis van jouw persoonlijke ontwikkelplan volg je samen met een aantal collega's diverse trainingen en bezoek je met enige regelmaat verschillende events. Daarnaast kun je meedoen aan externe én interne leer- en coaching trajecten van de Caesar Groep en geniet je van de volgende arbeidsvoorwaarden:



 Een salaris afhankelijk van jouw werkervaring maar ergens tussen de €4.800 en €6.000;



 Mobiliteitsbudget om te besteden aan een (lease)auto
 

10% vakantiegeld en 26 vakantiedagen



 Een bonus op basis van onze prestaties als team



 Een goede werkgeversbijdrage aan jouw pensioen- en zorgverzekering



 Een laptop en telefoon naar keuze bij een vaste aanstelling en een onkostenvergoeding (internet/telefonie) voor het thuiswerken



 Opleidingsbudget (en -dagen), om nóg beter te worden in wat je doet, bijvoorbeeld door een workshop uit de Caesar Academy te volgen



 Gezellige activiteiten zoals padel, kennislunches of een uitje met onze eigen personeelsvereniging Julius

  

Bij Garansys doen we alles nét even anders. We zijn eigenwijs, gedreven en staan voor de nieuwe norm in IT-dienstverlening. Wij geloven dat we waarde creëren voor onze klant door hecht met elkaar samen te werken en onze oplossingen te leveren op het juiste moment, met garantie en zekerheid. Hierbij kijken we verder dan alleen de technologie. Wij zorgen ervoor dat we gegarandeerd het verschil maken door de juiste oplossing te ontwerpen, ontwikkelen en beheren op basis van Dynamics365, het Power Platform en Microsoft Azure. Deel jij onze ambitie? Word dan onze nieuwe collega!

-------------------


Are you eager to contribute to a still further improvement of ASML’s nanolithography technology, and are you fascinated by partial differential equations (PDEs) and machine learning?  

If yes, then this vacancy, a cooperation between ASML Research and TU/e’s Centre for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications, might be something for you.


**Job Description**  

Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) The PhD position is in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) of Eindhoven University of Technology. M&CS is the largest department of TU/e and one of the largest departments in the Netherlands in the area of mathematics and computer science. M&CS has research collaborations with the other departments at TU/e, with many companies in the Eindhoven area, and with universities and companies in the Netherlands and abroad. M&CS contributes to science and engineering by performing both fundamental and applied research. Through M&CS’s close relationship with the high-tech industry in the Eindhoven area, staff and students contribute directly to the development of relevant technological innovations. M&CS is organized in three different domains: mathematics, computer science, and data science. Each domain consists of several clusters. The mathematics domain has three clusters: CASA (Center for Analysis, Scientific Computing, and Applications), DM (Discrete Mathematics), and SPOR (Statistics, Probability, and Operations Research). The domain of computer science is organized into five different clusters: ALGA (Algorithms, Geometry and Applications), FSA (Formal System Analysis), IRIS (Interconnected Resource-aware Intelligent Systems), SEC (Security), and SET (Software Engineering and Technology). Data science has three clusters: DAI (Data and Artificial Intelligence), PA (Process Analytics), and VIS (Visualization). The PhD position for which this call is, is in the cluster CASA.


*Center for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications (CASA)*  

The research objective of CASA is to develop new and improve existing mathematical (both analytical and numerical) methods for a wide range of applications in science and engineering. Mathematics research within CASA is often driven by models from science and engineering, for instance by mathematical expressions of physical laws (often systems of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations). Stimulated by the immense growth in the availability and use of data, mathematics in CASA is also becoming data-driven, with a crucial role in this for machine learning. There is enormous potential for the use of data and machine learning (particularly neural networks) in analysis and scientific computing, in combination with the use of first-principle models. CASA is continuing its longstanding expertise and success in variational calculus, functional analysis, numerical methods for partial differential equations, numerical linear algebra, and model-order reduction methods while extending its research into the direction of data science, machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and high-performance computing.


*Knowledge and Physics-Informed Artificial Intelligence (KPAI)*  

The availability and importance of data for the design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance of  

semiconductor machinery has increased significantly. Classical engineering methods can be augmented by  

data taken from observations in machines or from documented knowledge sources based upon earlier  

design and manufacturing steps. The translation of these diverse forms of information requires novel  

approaches that extract meaningful outputs, which are then utilizable for engineering goals.  

From the national program TKI (Top consortia for Knowledge and Innovation), funding has been acquired for  

the research program Knowledge and Physics Informed Artificial Intelligence (KPAI), including two PhD  

projects, each focused on a different type of source information. The program KPAI will be co-funded by and  

carried out in cooperation with ASML Research. The two PhD projects in the KPAI program are:


* Extraction and representation in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the physics governing semiconductor manufacturing processes (model discovery).
* Information extraction from semi-structured sources of information and their representation in a knowledge graph and a large language model for trustworthy conversational AI.


Both projects will bring these two forms of information together in such a way that a tool is realized for quick support to engineers. The first of above two projects, for which the present call is, will be carried out in the cluster CASA, the second in the cluster DAI.


**Job requirements**
--------------------


We are looking for a talented, enthusiastic PhD candidate meeting the following requirements:


* Master degree in (applied) mathematics or related discipline.
* Experience with numerically solving ordinary and partial differential equations.
* Experience with optimization methods and interest in machine learning.

* Creative pro-active team player with good analytical skills.
* Research-oriented attitude.
* Ability to work in interdisciplinary team and to collaborate with industrial partner.
* Motivated to develop teaching skills and coach students.
* Fluent in spoken and written English.

**Conditions of employment**

Als Junior heb je verhoogde interesse in software technologie, met in het bijzonder front-end technologieën. HTML/CSS is peanuts uiteraard maar het echte werk zit in de javascript libraries. Je hebt kennis en de eerste stapjes gezet met front-end frameworks zoals Vue of React en bent bekend met frameworks zoals Bootstrap en Tailwind. Je schrikt niet van utility-first en een .json bestand is goed te lezen. Je hebt wellicht zelf al eens een REST API aangeroepen met een asynchrone functie.


Wij maken gebruik van de Azure Cloud met Python back-end en Vue / Vuetify front-end en maken je wegwijs in onze manier van werken. We verwachten niet dat je op dag 1 al direct onze applicaties kan ontwikkelen, maar wel dat je leergierig bent en onder begeleiding van onze Senior Front-End Engineer en development team je de kennis eigen maakt. Je onderzoekt ook nieuwe technologieën en werkt actief mee aan de ontwikkeling en het onderhoud van onze producten. We helpen je groeien in de Front-End vanuit een praktische context.

### **Medior**


Als Medior heb je natuurlijk al de nodige stappen gezet in de Front-End (bij voorkeur met Vue) en de achterliggende services om goed werkende en prettig ogende software te ontwikkelen. Als Medior Front-End Engineer ontwerp je ook mee als dat in je capaciteiten valt: het is niet alleen uitvoerende taak maar het biedt ook de mogelijkheid om mee te denken en te ontwerpen om de mooiste en best werkende software te maken. Enige kennis van back-end software engineering is meegenomen om de afstemming met de rest van het team soepel te laten verlopen. Je hebt de nodige kennis opgedaan van responsive design, utility-first, en bent goed op de hoogte van ontwikkelingen in de Front-End Engineering wereld en kunt meedenken met het vertalen naar onze problematiek. Als Medior kun je altijd leunen op ons Senior Front-End Engineer en Development team, maar ontwikkel je ook eigen opvattingen over hoe het beter, slimmer, handiger, veiliger schaalbaarder kan.

### **Waar zijn wij naar op zoek?**

* Je hebt een (HBO of Universitaire) opleiding, bij voorkeur op het vlak van Informatica, Technische Informatica, Wiskunde, Natuurkunde of Kunstmatige Intelligentie of een andere opleiding met een sterke technische basis zoals ICT, Software Engineering, Information Technology, HBO-ICT.
* Je hebt hands-on kennis van HTML/CSS/Javascript, Vue (of React)
* Je hebt een begrip van aansluiting op de Back-End middels REST-API en .json en affiniteit met cloud technologie.
* ***Voor de Medior functie***:
	+ 3 tot 5 jaar ervaring met Front-End engineering. Bij voorkeur in Vue (React of Angular kan ook, maar wij gebruiken Vue dus kun je sneller aan de slag).
	+ Je hebt ervaring met Git is vereist
	+ Vanzelfsprekend weet je hoe je dingen responsive kunt maken
	+ Kwaliteitsgerichtheid en een hoog verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel
	+ Je hebt ervaring met opschaling, performance en availability.
	+ Je hebt kennis van REST-API’s, json en asynchroon uitwisseling van data.
	+ Kennis van informatiebeveiliging en security is een pré.
* Verder gebruiken wij de Atlassian tools ( Jira / Confluence), Github en Co-pilot.

### **Wat je gaat doen:**

* Onze SAAS producten Apollo of Juno doorontwikkelen voor veel verschillende klanten (Overheid / B2B)
* Ontwerpen en optimaliseren van designs
* Een front-end-visie mede ontwikkelen voor ons Stratum Analytics Platform met ons development team om onze datagedreven product-ambities te realiseren en betekenisvolle software te maken.
* Nauwe samenwerking met de rest van het development team om development en operations goed aan te laten sluiten.

### **Wat wij inspirerend vinden:**

* Maatschappelijke vraagstukken oplossen met hulp van data en software
* Grote mate van vrijheid en eigen verantwoordelijkheid
* Teamgeörienteerd
* Lean Startup, Kanban, Design Sprints, Co-Pilot, Design thinking, LLM
* Git, Docker, Vue, Nuxt, REST, JSON, SQL, NoSQL, Azure, OpenAI, ML
* Snelle en mooie software ontwikkelen en opschalen.

### **Welke competenties breng je mee:**

* Zelfstandig werken, resultaat gedreven
* Helder communiceren
* Meedenken, -ontwerpen en samenwerken
* Initiatief en flexibel van geest
* Analytisch vermogen
* Zelfontwikkeling en open staan voor nieuwe technologieën

### **Wat hebben wij je te bieden?**

* Wij zijn geen uren fabriek maar een productsoftware bedrijf dat werkt aan kick-ass datagedreven applicaties
* Klein team met ervaren en gedreven professionals met track record in Silicon Valley
* Gave maatschappelijke vraagstukken waarmee we de wereld mooier, veilige en schoner kunnen maken
* Grote mate van vrijheid, eigen verantwoordelijkheid en ruimte voor eigen inbreng
* Investeren in jouw kennis en ontwikkeling
* Uitstekende arbeidsvoorwaarden

Dit ga je doen
  
  

Voor de energie transitie is data, en jij dus, onmisbaar om vooruit te komen. Stedin heeft in 2020 de stap naar Microsoft Azure Cloud gemaakt. Met producten als Databricks en Azure Functions bouwen we aan zowel generieke datasets zodat de business goed kan sturen, maar ook aan Data Engineering vraagstukken (denk aan interfacing van en naar ons platform). Afhankelijk van de tool en toepassing gebruiken we veelal SQL of Python om de daadwerkelijke oplossingen te maken.
  
  

Dit doe jij in nauwe samenwerking met collega’s en andere teams zoals de Data Scientists en de DevOps- en platformteams van Stedin. Het nieuwe data landschap is continue aan verandering onderhevig en wordt steeds moderner en gaver om aan te werken. Om deze reden willen we graag een Senior Data Engineer/Technical Lead toevoegen aan ons team.
  
  

De uitdaging waar we voor staan is om uit onze ruwe data (en daar is er veel van, denk aan sensoren in het net) op een slimme manier om te zetten naar informatie. Als Senior Data Engineer vertaal je de informatiebehoefte naar succesvolle data-oplossingen. Hiervoor gebruik je onder andere technologieën van Databricks en Airflow. Je helpt ook mee bij de ontwikkeling en verdere positionering van de BI- en data-dienstverlening rondom onderwerpen zoals decentralisatie en het professionaliseren van self service BI. Hiermee helpen we onze bedrijfsafdelingen zoals Asset Management, Aansluiting & Vervanging, Storing & Onderhoud en de Transportketen te transformeren en data gedreven te maken door meer toegevoegde waarde uit data te halen.
  
  

Als Technical Lead ben je de Senior Data Engineer in een Agile (DevOps) team en ben je verantwoordelijk voor de technische detail uitwerking van de gemaakte architectuurontwerpen. Je stelt de technische normen op waar de oplossing aan moet voldoen, brengt jouw kennis in en geeft coaching aan je collega's in het ontwikkelen en beheren van oplossingen. Als Technical Lead heb je een goed begrip van hoe de oplossing in de solution architectuur past. Hiervoor werk je nauw samen met de Solution Architect en de Product Owner, met focus op de technische aspecten van de oplossing.
  
  

Je bent in staat om nieuwe tooling en programmeertalen snel eigen te maken. Ook vind je het leuk om samen te vernieuwen, jezelf te ontwikkelen en anderen mee te nemen. En bij alles wat je doet, hou je het belang van de klant in de gaten.
  
  

Jouw sterke punten
  
Worden we blij van
  
  

Word jij enthousiast van het leren van nieuwe dingen? Met jouw lef, hoge energieniveau en positieve instelling zet je elke dag die extra stap! Je hebt ervaring met het coachen van collega Engineers in het DevOps team om samen tot kwalitatief goed werkende technische oplossingen te komen. Je zoekt een plek om jouw ambities waar te maken. Een plek waar pro-activiteit verwelkomd wordt. En ja, dat vind je bij Stedin.
  
  

Wat jou verder onze Technical Lead Data Engineer maakt?
  
  

Je hebt minimaal 7 jaar relevante werkervaring waarvan 2 jaar ervaring als Tech Lead waarin je aantoonbaar features en de bijpassende architectuurkaders hebt vertaald naar een technische oplossing.
  
  

Het initiëren en helpen realiseren van verbetervoorstellen op gebied van het beheer, de technische werking en de architectuur van het platform.
  
  

Je hebt minimaal hbo werk- en denkniveau met aantoonbaar ervaring met o.a. Databricks en Microsoft Azure data services stack.
  
  

Aantoonbaar ervaring met datalake concepten zoals Databricks Delta Lake en fileformats als Parquet en Delta is een sterke pré.
  
  

Je hebt aantoonbaar ervaring met ELT/ ETL flows. En ervaring met Unix (shell)- en Python scripts maken t.b.v. automatisering is een pré.
  
  

Je hebt kennis van databases, o.a. SQL Server waardoor het schrijven van complexe queries voor jou geen probleem is.
  
  

Je bent bekend met best practices voor software-engineering, zoals OTAP, versiebeheer in GIT, testautomatisering en CI/CD.
  
  

Je hebt ook kennis van methoden en technieken t.b.v. de analyse van de bedrijfsprocessen en het doen van verbetervoorstellen. Ervaring met een Agile Scrum werkwijze, data modellering (Datavault en Kimball) en PowerBI zijn een pré.
  
  

Goede mondelinge en schriftelijke uitdrukkingsvaardigheid in Nederlands (niveau B2/ leergierig).
  
  

Een goed team
  
Daar hoor je bij
  
  

Meteen vanaf dag één maak je deel uit van de afdeling Smart Data Solutions. Deze afdeling bestaat uit meerdere Scrum teams. In de Data Delivery teams werken we op basis van DevOps. Samen met je collega’s vul je dus de rol in van zowel Technical lead, engineer en beheerder. Daarnaast adviseer je de Stedin business.
  
  

Wat ons bindt? De drive om samen te puzzelen en samen tot de beste oplossingen komen. Dat doen we met de Agile/Safe methodiek. Het team wordt steeds autonomer en werkt vaak vanuit huis. Wel komen we graag minstens eens per week samen op kantoor (standplaats Rotterdam Blaak) voor inhoudelijke overleg en Scrum events.
  
  

Een goede werksfeer mag daarbij natuurlijk niet ontbreken. Daarnaast werk je nauw samen je collega Technical Leads in de Tech Lead Community of practice waar je technische oplossingen afstemt en je rol verder ontwikkelt. Er is veel aandacht voor inhoudelijke én persoonlijke ontwikkeling, o.a. door het Technical Lead leiderschapsprogramma. En reken maar dat we onze successen goed vieren. Want waar we hard werken, lachen we ook hard. Dat is de sfeer bij IT. Hoe beter de samenwerking, des te meer successen er gevierd worden. Wij dagen je uit!
  
  

Mooie arbeidsvoorwaarden
  
Die wil je hebben
  
  

Dat je van ons je eigen telefoon (of een Bring Your Own Device vergoeding) en laptop krijgt, vinden we nogal vanzelfsprekend. Wat mag je nog meer van Stedin als werkgever verwachten?
  
  

Alle financiële arbeidsvoorwaarden op een rij, weet je meteen waar je aan toe bent:
  
  

Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden horen erbij. Zo krijg je een (maximaal) salaris van €7.777, - gebaseerd op 40 uur per week en kennis en ervaring, 24,5 vakantiedagen en bouw je prima pensioen op bij het ABP.
  
  

Boven op je salaris ontvang je een persoonlijk budget van 24% (inclusief 8% vakantiegeld). Jij kiest wat je met het budget doet. Elke maand extra salaris? Of meer verlofdagen? In onze nieuwe Rekentool krijg je een alvast voorproefje van hoe jouw persoonlijk budget eruit zou kunnen zien en hoe je het zou kunnen besteden.
  
  

Gezonde energie die heb je nodig. Daarom krijg je van ons ook een Duurzaam Inzetbaarheid budget van €500 bruto per jaar (bijvoorbeeld voor je sportabonnement, een hometrainer of je nieuwe sport outfit).
  
  

Volgens ons Stedin@Work concept werk je 50% thuis en 50% op kantoor, wel zo flexibel. Wij zorgen voor jouw thuiswerkfaciliteiten, een thuiswerkvergoeding en reizen naar kantoor doe je met je OV vrij-abonnement waarmee je ook buiten werk onbeperkt kan reizen!
  
  

**Daar komt dit nog bovenop:**  

Werken bij Stedin betekent werken bij een World-class Workplace. Een van de trotspunten .van onze (en jouw toekomstige) collega’s? Werksfeer.
  
  

**Jouw ontwikkeling staat centraal:** events bezoeken met collega’s, meedoen aan kennissessies, trainingen en opleidingen volgen. Zo geven we jouw talent écht alle kans en haal jij het beste uit jezelf.
  
  

Goede koffie van Heilige Boontjes. In Rotterdam kun je jouw bakkie ook halen bij onze ‘gebarista’ (onze slechthorende barista).
  
  

Toon meer Toon minder
  
Bekijk Onze
  
arbeidsvoorwaarden
  
  

Elke maand je Persoonlijk Budget kiezen
  
  

Het Persoonlijk Budget is een percentage van je bruto maandsalaris en ontvang je bovenop je salaris. Afhankelijk van je salarisschaal is dat tot 24% van je brutosalaris, inclusief 8% vakantiegeld. Je bepaalt zelf waaraan je het Persoonlijk Budget wilt besteden. Zo kun je het uit laten keren voor een maandelijks extraatje. Of je koopt extra verlofdagen.
  
  

Flexibele werktijden
  
  

Wil je zelf je werkweek indelen? Samen met je leidinggevende bepaal jij zo veel mogelijk je eigen werktijden. We werken 8 uur per dag. Afhankelijk van je werkzaamheden, heb je de mogelijkheid om, wanneer het kan, thuis te werken.
  
  

Vervoer
  
  

We zijn een duurzaam bedrijf. Reis je met het OV naar je werk, dan krijg je van ons een OV Vrij-abonnement 2e klas. Dit abonnement mag je ook privé gebruiken. Kies je voor een vaste reiskostenvergoeding dan ontvang je 13 cent per kilometer (maximaal 60 kilometer enkele reis) voor de dagen dat je reist voor je werk. Met je Persoonlijk Budget kun je dit aanvullen tot 21 cent netto per kilometer. Krijg je je eigen bedrijfsauto of -bus, dan mag je deze ook gebruiken voor woon-werkverkeer. Voor zakelijk verkeer gebruiken we deelauto’s.

Our proprietary software makes renewable energy sources more predictable and profitable, nudging fossil fuels off the grid, and accelerating the transition to sustainable energy.

#### **Power up our team**



As a DevOps Engineer, you will join our talented Engineering department, **working in the Infrastructure team** which enables Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists and Data Engineers in other teams to go faster, instead of working on Terraform code, storage, load balancing and related areas. The infrastructure team is moving these concerns away, allowing them to focus on the bigger picture: making renewable energy sources win the energy market!


#### **It’s time to amp up your career**



This year, the Infrastructure team is building a **Platform and rearchitecting GCP** - a lot of greenfield work is planned on this. This DevOps Engineer role is a great fit for **senior-level engineers** who would like to take the lead in designing and implementing a piece of the infrastructure puzzle.



Some examples of the puzzle include topics on how we manage our AI workloads on GKE on GCP, scale massive amounts of data across multiple cloud platforms, keep costs under control while allowing for extensive Machine Learning experiments, improve our security posture, and define and implement standards and best practises around SRE and DevOps.



This role is a good fit for you if you like taking **full ownership of large infrastructure projects** which entail stakeholder management, as well as designing, building and maintaining our infrastructure, and assisting and guiding our product teams on any DevOps-related topics. You’re doing this by advocating for SRE and DevOps best practices.



You will be teaming up with Adriaan, DevOps Tech Lead; Matthijs and Cole, DevOps Engineers; and Jan, our Engineering Manager.



To be successful in this role, you should be excited to join a company that is working towards a cleaner energy future. You should thrive in a collaborative, entrepreneurial environment and be motivated to keep learning new things.

Met jouw expertise in Python en cloudsystemen werk je nauw samen met jouw collega's in Team POWER om de werkprocessen te optimaliseren en te stroomlijnen, waardoor aanzienlijke efficiëntiewinst gerealiseerd kan worden. Team POWER (Planning Operational Work Efficiently & Realistically) geeft datagedreven adviezen en doet voorspellingen om zo meer productie, betrouwbaarheid, voorspelbaarheid en flow te brengen in de voorbereiding van cases. Het doel van POWER is om een prognose te geven van doorlooptijden in de GV/R&N voorbereidingsfase en daarmee de Geplande Start Uitvoering (GSU) te voorspellen. Om een goede voorspelling te doen dient veel data samen gebracht te worden. Deze verzamelde data geven we direct aan de Engineer terug d.m.v. onze QuickScan. In onze QuickScan krijgt de Engineer in het begin van de voorbereiding in één oogopslag een overzicht van alle omgevings- en projectvariabelen die een rol spelen bij een case in de voorbereiding. Hiermee komen risico’s vroegtijdig in beeld, wordt vertraging voorkomen en kunnen we beter plannen met onze stakeholders en partners. Het energienet van de toekomst maken we voor iedereen, mét iedereen. En als Data Science Software Engineer werk jij hieraan mee. Zo ben jij bezig met het:

* Ontwikkelen en onderhouden van softwareoplossingen en tools voor dataverzameling, -analyse en -visualisatie.
* Meedraaien in een innovatief en groeiend Scrum DevOps team.
* Implementeren en onderhouden van AI modellen, optimalisatie-algoritmen en andere analytische toepassingen.
* Bevorderen van het toepassen van testautomatisering in Agile teams, waar dit toegevoegde waarde biedt t.o.v. handmatig testen.
* Beheren en onderhouden van de cloudomgeving en deployment pipeline.
* Delen van kennis door middel van samenwerking en kennissessies.


Met jouw bijdragen bouwen we aan een slimmer en efficiënter energienet dat klaar is voor de toekomst.

**Jij maakt het net completer bij Alliander**


Wist je dat we bij Alliander uit verschillende bedrijven bestaan? Samen met Liander, Qirion, Qterra, Dep, Firan en Entrnce ontwikkelen én beheren we het energienet voor miljoenen inwoners van Nederland. En met de huidige energietransitie is dat hard werken. Dat doen we met de hulp van een grote club vakmensen. Dankzij deze talenten hebben wij het volste vertrouwen in de energietoekomst van Nederland. Samen met jou maken wij dat mogelijk.

  

De drive om te ontdekken wat mogelijk is kan alleen als jij genoeg energie hebt. En de juiste werkomgeving geeft jou dat. Alliander zal radicaal anders te werk moeten gaan om in de komende paar jaar de productie te vervijfvoudigen. Team POWER is één van de teams die een grote rol speelt in deze versnelling, door het voorbereidingswerk verregaand te digitaliseren en te automatiseren. Hierbij staan data en voorspellingen centraal. Wij voorspellen de meest optimale planning van projecten en monitoren doorlooptijden. Door optimalisatie van alle projectplanningen samen, kan het werk met een goede flow uitgevoerd worden. Wij verzamelen en combineren hiervoor data uit verschillende bronnen, zoals werktekeningen, vergunningen, geografische factoren en levertijden, zodat het werk slimmer kan worden gedaan en we betrouwbaarder worden in onze planning richting bijvoorbeeld klanten, monteurs en aannemers.


Team POWER bestaat momenteel uit een Product Owner, Scrum Master, twee Front-End Developers, drie Data Engineers en een Business Analist. Binnenkort gaan we ons team flink uitbreiden met o.a. Data Scientists, een Data Engineer en Business Analist. We overleggen wekelijks met eindgebruikers en geven regelmatig demo’s.


Ons team als innovatief, ambitieus, pragmatisch en gedreven. We werken hybride vanuit huis en doorgaans één keer per week op het Alliander kantoor in Arnhem.


We werken met: AWS Serverless (lambda), AWS CDK, Python, PostgreSQL, API/Rest, Kafka, TypeScript en Angular.

**Jij maakt het net energieker**


Werken met de nieuwste technieken en innovaties. Dat doe je vanuit je eigen kracht en talent. En dat doe je bij ons. Draag jij daaraan bij met jouw logische manier van denken? En vul je dit daarnaast aan met:

* ervaring met werken in teams die data science software ontwikkelen
* minimaal 5 jaar ervaring met Python.
* kennis van CI/CD pipelines met GIT en PR reviews
* ervaring met object georiënteerd programmeren
* ervaring met geautomatiseerde tests (unittests enz.)
* ervaring met dataclasses
* werken met cloudsystemen zoals AWS
* ervaring met data science en lineaire optimalisatie

**Voor jou net beter geregeld**


Daarvoor krijg jij op basis van een 38-urige werkweek:

  

* een salaris van € 4.274 tot € 6.106 bruto per maand (schaal 9)
* Jaarlijks bovenop je salaris, een individueel keuze budget (IKB) van 18% (fulltime) of 12,8% (parttime) van je bruto jaarsalaris. Dit is inclusief 8% vakantietoeslag. Je kunt dit bedrag uit laten betalen, maar je kunt er bijvoorbeeld ook extra vrije dagen voor kopen. Jij kiest wat bij jou past.
* 24,5 vakantiedagen per jaar, ruim aan te vullen met 35 dagen vanuit je IKB (op fulltime basis).
* een eindejaarsuitkering in december van 6% van je jaarsalaris
* vergoedingen voor studies en trainingen. Alliander vergoedt in de meeste gevallen jouw gehele opleiding.

Do you believe that computer simulations will hold an increasingly crucial role in clinical care? Read on!

  


**Job Description**  

Thanks to the ever-growing computational resources in modern day society, digital twinning is increasingly becoming a powerful technique in several fields, including medicine. A digital twin is a computational analogue of any physical object or phenomenon, which by replicating its key working mechanisms, allows for predicting its behaviour under a wide range of conditions. In the biomedical research field, digital twins are used for a wide range of applications, including, e.g., the in silico validation of novel devices and patient-specific modelling of organs to predict responses to different treatment strategies and personalise patient care, accordingly.

  

  

The Horizon Europe VITAL (VIrtual Twins as tools for personalised clinicAL care, https://vital-horizoneurope.eu/) project aims to take digital twinning for personalised medical care to the next level; rather than focusing on individual organs, we will build a multi-scale, multi-organ modelling platform for optimising medical (pharmacological) or surgical (interventional) therapy for complex, multifactorial cardiovascular disorders, namely hypertension, heart failure, and haemodynamically complicated atrial septal defects. VITAL involves ten academic (University of Gent, Belgium; University of Auckland, New Zeeland; Maastricht University and Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands; King’s College London and University College London, United Kingdom; École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland; University of Pisa, Italy; Jagiellonian University, Poland) and four industrial partners (Austrian Institute of Technology, Austria; IMEC and Westerhof Cardiovascular Research, The Netherlands; ELEM Biotech, Spain). Within this highly international consortium, your research at Maastricht University will focus on modelling the vasculature, which plays a crucial role in connecting and nourishing different organs. The main focus of your project will be modelling the behaviour of vascular smooth muscle cells, which are chiefly responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of blood vessels over time (vascular remodelling) and for regulating vascular function through vaso-constriction/-dilation.

  


Besides the VITAL partners, your project will be embedded within the Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht (CARIM), part of the Faculty of Health, Medicine, and Life Sciences at Maastricht University. Your appointment will be with the Dept. of Biomedical Engineering, where you will work directly with a core team of three PhD students, two postdocs (both directly involved in VITAL), an assistant professor, and a full professor. Our diverse department hosts people (43% female) from countries all over the world, including Bulgaria, Croatia, Egypt, Italy, Lebanon, the Netherlands, and Sudan, and is committed to creating an open, team science environment for everybody to thrive. In your PhD project, you will:


* Develop multi-scale (from a sub to cellular level) computational models of human vascular smooth muscle cell.
* Integrate vascular smooth muscle cell models into a vessel wall model.
* Conduct ex vivo and in vivo human tissue biomechanics studies.
* Develop strategies for model parametrisation with clinically measurable data.
* Collaborate closely with basic scientists, engineers, and medical doctors.

  




**Requirements**  

This project will bring together engineering, experimental, and clinical expertise. Therefore, to forward this project, collaboration and perseverance will be key. The following are required:


* Master’s degree or equivalent in (Biomedical or Mechanical) Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related field.
* Affection with biomechanics and modelling.
* Eagerness to learn and to collaborate with people outside one’s field of expertise.

  




**What we offer**  

**As** **PhD candidate in Vascular Biomechanics: Digital twinning for personalised cardiovascular care** **at** **Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences****, you will be employed by the most international university in the Netherlands, located in the beautiful city of Maastricht.

***Running up that Hill: Enabling ultra-efficient wings with the Delft Laminar Hump***


Job description


**About the project:**  

The transition of airflow from laminar to turbulent state is a major contributor to aerodynamic drag and consequently aircraft emissions. Often, unavoidable modifications of the wing surface, such as panel joints or skin deformations decrease the extent of laminar airflow by promoting transition. However, through our research, we showed that this is not always the case. In a recent breakthrough, our team discovered the “Delft Laminar Hump”, a passive smooth surface modification. The proof-of-concept experiments showed the capability of the Hump to create an unprecedented delay of transition, effectively increasing the extent of laminar flow.


**The “Running up that Hill” project aims at achieving a clear physical understanding of the interaction between laminar-turbulent transition and surface modifications such as the Delft Laminar Hump.** **The fundamental and technical outcomes of this work will position Hump-like surface modifications as an enabling technology for curbing environmental emissions of aviation.**

In addition to fundamental work, the project is supported by leading aerospace partners such as KLM, DNW, and Deharde as well as by world-leading groups at U. Waterloo, Canada and KTH, Sweden. Opportunities for research stays with these organisations will be available within the project.



We are seeking two enthusiastic and skilled PhD candidates to join our team and work on this exciting project.


**Important:** during submission, please indicate in your motivation letter which of the following two positions you are interested in:


**PhD position 1:** will encompass theoretical and numerical modelling, necessary to simulate the effect of surface modifications on swept wing transition. Flow stability analysis tools available in our team can be used, including Orr-Sommerfeld solvers, linear/non-linear Parabolised Stability Equations and our non-linear Harmonic Navier-Stokes solver. An extensive validation effort will involve high-fidelity Direct Numerical Simulations, in collaboration with the group at KTH Stockholm (Prof. D. Henningson and Dr. A. Hanifi). Research stays at KTH will be covered by the project.

  


**PhD position 2:** will explore the experimental design and testing of laminar hump models and undertake advanced flow measurements to characterise the underlying transition mechanisms. The candidate will work in the state-of-art windtunnel facilities at TU Delft. The experimental activities will also involve collaboration with U. Waterloo, Canada (Prof. S. Yarusevych), with research stays available.

  


**About the team:**  

We are a young, international, and diverse team of colleagues working on topics closely related to the newly founded chair of Flow Control. We approach problems in a horizontal “team spirit” and continuously traverse boundaries between theory, simulations, and experiments towards understanding and controlling fluid flows. Our team, strives for a co-creative and stimulating environment where we can develop our skills as a scientist, team member and teacher. We place great emphasis on a collegial working environment where everyone is welcome and encouraged to shape their PhD track. We also enjoy many team-building activities and events where you can get to know your teammates in a different environment, share personal life experiences and have a great time outside of the lab!

in spreadsheets and databases) to accurately, securely, and efficiently, democratize insights from  

data? This 4-year PhD starting September 2024 is for you!


**Job description**
-------------------

**Goal of the DataLibra project**  

Approximately 120 zettabytes of data has been collected worldwide but less than 1% is actually  

used. Structured data, e.g. tables, spreadsheets, and relational databases, is prevailing in  

organizations and typically informs important decisions in healthcare, governments and finance.  

Yet, while AI has demonstrated a high impact on applications on text and images, proportional  

progress on structured data is lacking. With the DataLibra project, we aim to close this gap, by  

developing AI models and tools for structured data (Table Representation Learning), to help  

organizations, of any size, domain, and level of data literacy, get insights from structured data,  

efficiently, accurately and securely.

  

  

**Goal of this PhD project**  

Following recent developments in AI, large language models (LLMs) have been explored for data  

analytics tasks (e.g. text-to-sql), but show limited accuracy in domain-specific contexts with  

structured data. In this project, we will investigate and design interactive intelligent systems for  

data analytics tasks, while accounting for two key challenges: trustworthiness of the outputs  

(factuality), and security constraints of proprietary data contexts as in healthcare, enterprises, and  

governments. Potential directions to explore are agentic systems, retrieval augmented generation,  

(instruction) fine-tuning, and others.

  

  

**What you will be doing**  

 Inform a research agenda on the PhD topic for a timespan of four years.  

 Develop methods and systems for contextualizing generative AI for analytics over  

structured data.  

 Actively collaborate with other researchers in the DataLibra project (students, 4-5 PhDs,  

postdocs, PI) and external collaborators (e.g. Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam).  

 Communicate research outcomes through papers and presentations at conferences,  

workshops and other (scientific) gatherings.  

 Assist in relevant teaching activities at universities, such as thesis supervision and assisting  

in courses.


**Requirements**
----------------

* A master (or equivalent) in computer science, artificial intelligence or similar.
* Self-drive, creativity, rigor, ownership, and excitement to push research in TRL forward.
* Theoretical knowledge of, or experience with, data management, human-computer


interaction, and/or machine learning such as representation and generative learning.  

* Programming skills, e.g. Python, Java, or C++.
* Excellent command in English, verbal and written.
* Prior experience as a research assistant during (under)graduate studies is advantageous

-------------------


Are you interested in developing theory to help solve practical problems in the fields of databases and data science? We have an opening for a fully funded 5-year PhD project where query languages arising from linear algebra operations are studied, to let data scientists experience the power of database technology.


This is a 5-years fully funded PhD position within the Database group of the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). You will join a vibrant team of 5 permanent researchers/academics and 8 PhD students, and have the ability to collaborate with other top research institutes across Europe. You will participate in cutting-edge research and target leading conferences and journals in database theory (e.g., ICDT, PODS, TODS). You will travel to present your work in international conferences and meet world-class academics.


You will be supervised by dr. Robert Brijder and work on foundations for scalable and principled data management systems for data science and machine learning. Data scientists and AI researchers currently often miss out on many of the advances in the field of databases because the data that they use is not tabular but in the form of matrices or higher-dimensional arrays (tensors), and because the accompanying operations are very different. In this project, you will study query languages resulting from basic linear algebra or tensor operations and programming constructs. Natural questions arise, such as expressivity, links and compatibility with existing query languages like SQL, scalability, query optimization, etc. Solving these questions establishes foundations for data management systems aimed at data scientists and AI researchers that are both scalable and principled.


This is a Teaching PhD position (PhD-TA). Throughout your PhD you will also spend some time helping with the teaching of some relevant courses (e.g., by running instruction sessions, and by correcting students' homework). You will also have the opportunity to obtain teaching qualifications.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* BSc and MSc degree in Mathematics, Computer Science, or a closely related field.
* Good knowledge of linear algebra, graph theory, and logic.
* Programming experience.
* English language proficiency (C1 level).

Job description


In this PhD project we will develop novel mathematical cognitive models that represent social and cognitive interactions of humans, as well as novel control architectures (based on model-based predictive control methods and/or game theory), and we will incorporate them into multi-agent architectures to realize optimal human-machine teamwork.



This PhD project is funded in the context of the TU Delft AI Labs & Talent programme, and is defined at the AI\*MAN lab (Transparent & Traceable AI in Human-AI Teamwork). The primary supervisor (Dr. A. Jamshidnejad) is affiliated to the Aerospace Engineering Faculty of TU Delft (Mathematical Decision Making Group) and is the co-director of the AI\*MAN lab. The promotor (Dr. M. Mazo Espinosa) and co-supervisor (Dr. C. Cenedese) are affiliated to the Mechanical Engineering Faculty of TU Delft (Delft Center for Systems and Control).



At the AI\*MAN lab, our mission is to investigate the emerging interdisciplinary domain of human-AI teamwork. In such problems, optimality, adaptability, transparency, and traceability in control and decision-making of machines that interact or collaborate with humans, should be met. Therefore, the multi-agent systems that include humans and machines should achieve four crucial objectives:



* Making real-time optimal decisions that meet all the constraints of the team and that assist the team to reach its global objectives, despite different preferences and goals of individual team members.


* Adapting the decisions made by machines in the team according to the current and predicted changes in the dynamics of the environment and in the behavior of human teammates.


* Communicating the decision-making processes of machines transparently with humans.


* Developing mental models of humans that enable machines to understand and predict the decisions and actions of humans.



In this PhD project we will support the AI\*MAN lab objectives by focusing on the following interacting objectives:


* Developing mathematical models of human cognition and decision making and incorporating them into multi-agent systems to represent the social interactions of humans and artificial agents.
* Introducing optimal, coordinated decision-making architectures for the artificial agents in the multi-agent system and analyzing the performance guarantees.
* Implementing the proposed theoretical approaches to applications that involve teams of humans and autonomous agents (e.g., social or service robots, autonomous vehicles, …) using computer-based simulations and/or to (small) teams composed of real humans and robots.

-------------------


  
Hoeveel kinkhoest, mazelen of COVID-19 besmettingen zijn er op dit moment in Nederland? Met jouw data skills help jij mee aan het beantwoorden van deze vragen. Hoe je het ook wendt of keert, werken bij het RIVM is een impactvolle baan.



Wat ga je doen



Als data scientist richt je je op het (adviseren over het) automatiseren van surveillance pipelines binnen het centrum Epidemiologie en Surveillance van Infectieziekten (EPI). Daarbij hoort het scripten van de data transformatie en het vertalen van data naar inzichtelijke outputs volgens de door het team ontwikkelde standaarden. De hiervoor gebruikte surveillance data zijn afkomstig uit verschillende databronnen, bijvoorbeeld meldingen gedaan door de GGD'en, NICE intensive care, ziekenhuis data, Infectieradar en data van de huisartsen peilstations. Een voorbeeld van de output van een geautomatiseerde surveillance pipeline die gebruikt maakt van meerdere van bovenstaande bronnen is griep, kijk op deze website hoe dit eruitziet: https://www.rivm.nl/griep-griepprik/feiten-en-cijfers.



Eén dag per week adviseer je collega’s over het bouwen van hun eigen surveillance pipelines. Een aantal dagen per maand ben je het aanspreekpunt voor technische vragen over de pipelines die binnen het centrum voor surveillance doeleinden worden gebruikt. Op andere dagen ben je zelf bezig met het bouwen en het beheer van pipelines en dashboards en draag je bij aan het efficiënter maken van de pipelines en rapportages. Je bent onderdeel van een gedreven team en levert direct een bijdrage aan het inzichtelijk maken van de beschikbare gegevens.



Verantwoordelijkheden:


* Efficiënte en correcte scripts.
* Ophalen van vraagstukken en deze correct en tijdig beantwoorden.
* Technisch ondersteunen van de epidemiologen.
* Tijdige oplevering rapportages, dashboards en andere outputs.


Uniek aan deze baan



De aard van de werkzaamheden vertoont een innovatief karakter, waardoor er volop gelegenheid is om kennis en expertise op te bouwen op het gebied van R en datastromen. Je neemt deel aan diverse projecten en processen, waarbij de nadruk ligt op het creëren van maatschappelijke relevantie via geavanceerde data science-methoden voor de surveillance van infectieziekten.



Afdeling



Vanuit de afdeling Data, Innovatie en Signalering (DIS) ondersteunen we met 30 medewerkers de rest van het centrum EPI op het gebied van datamanagement en BI, data science en privacy compliance. In totaal werken bij de afdeling DIS meer dan 25 data specialisten - waarvan negen bij het data science team - aan het gereed maken van surveillance data van onder andere de infectieziekten COVID-19, influenza en MPOX.



DIS heeft binnen EPI een centrale rol bij het standaardiseren van de surveillance datastromen van infectieziektes. Veel handmatige en (soms) ad hoc processen worden nu omgezet in gestandaardiseerde en geautomatiseerde processen. Het team werkt aan het (nog) efficiënter inrichten van deze standaarden en aan verdere uitrol binnen EPI. Het team geeft hiervoor advies aan collega’s over het bouwen van hun eigen surveillance pipelines. Het team vertaalt in overleg met epidemiologen deze gegevens naar inzichtelijke tabellen, grafieken, kaarten en rapporten. Deze worden gebruikt als basis voor regionaal, landelijk of internationaal beleid ten aanzien van de bestrijding van infectieziektes. Het team werkt in R (met Tidyverse) voor data pipelines, met GitLab voor version control, met R Markdown voor automatische rapportages en R Shiny voor dashboards.



Daarnaast wordt door middel van text mining data inzichtelijk gemaakt welke de epidemiologen kunnen gebruiken voor het surveillance proces. Op dit moment wordt er met (gen)AI verkent hoe deze technologie kan bijdragen aan onze werkzaamheden. Het team werkt binnen het centrum nauw samen met een team van epidemiologen, datamanagers en onderzoekers en daarbuiten ook met andere (data science) experts van de ICT-organisatie.



De werksfeer binnen ons team is open, vriendelijk, gedreven en nieuwsgierig. Iedereen is druk bezig met uiteenlopende projecten, maar staat toch open voor vragen en springt bij als dit nodig is. Jouw collega’s zijn over het algemeen zeer leergierig; innovatie en nieuwe ideeën worden aangemoedigd. Doordat er binnen dit team niet alleen softwareontwikkeling plaatsvindt, maar ook support en trainingen worden gegeven aan epidemiologen, is het team ook sociaal sterk verbonden met de andere afdelingen. Een goede, ontspannen werksfeer wordt bevorderd door een dagelijkse lunchwandeling in het bos, werkuitjes en borrels. Naast de werkdagen op kantoor (minimaal 2 dagen per week) is er ook ruimte om vanuit huis te werken en zo de privé-werk balans optimaal in te richten.

-------------------


  
Wat ga je doen?  

Als data (science) architect maak je onderdeel uit van de afdeling Informatie & Automatisering (I&A) waarbinnen momenteel een datateam wordt opgebouwd. Samen met een data engineer, informatie analisten, de informatiemanager en de IT architect, werk je aan het op een slimme en innovatieve manier beschikbaar stellen van benodigde (historische) data, het verkrijgen van inzichten en het identificeren van trends. Je bent de data architect binnen ZonMw, en voert regie over wijzigingen en de ontwikkeling van nieuwe producten.



In lijn met haar digitale strategie, wil ZonMw data inzetten om effectiever te sturen op het primaire proces en de bedrijfsvoering. Momenteel loopt een grootschalig programma voor stroomlijning van processen en het structureren van informatie. Het bestaande Datawarehouse wordt momenteel vervangen door een nieuwe oplossing waarmee informatieproducten zoals dashboards en rapportages ontwikkeld en onderhouden kunnen worden. De historische data is op dit moment onvoldoende gestructureerd. Er is behoefte aan innovatieve oplossingen om op een slimme manier structuur aan te brengen en inzichten te verkrijgen uit (historische) data. Er is conceptuele én technische mapping nodig op de nieuwe situatie. Met de informatiemanager moet bepaald worden hoe de nieuwe structuur eruit moet komen te zien om in de toekomst ook de juiste inzichten te creëren.



Je gaat aan de slag met:


* Verdiepen in de data(structuren) van de historische ZonMw-data
* Verkennen van innovatieve aanpak om data science toe te passen op historische ZonMw-data
* Structuur aanbrengen in data om data science toe te passen binnen ZonMw

Aan opleiding, ervaring en kennis heb je het volgende in huis:


* minimaal een Masteropleiding in Informatica, Data Science of vergelijkbare richting
* minimaal 3 jaar aantoonbare werkervaring als data scientist
* minimaal 3 jaar aantoonbare werkervaring als data architect


Deze competenties passen bij je:

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)
* Python (Pyspark is een pré) en SQL

**Fijne pre's:**

* Kennis van Audit
* Kennis van Fabric

**Daarnaast vragen we dat je:**

* Een teamspeler bent
* Communicatief vaardig bent
* Proactief te werk gaat

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.  

  

Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?  

  

Naast een afgeronde Bachelor of Master en enkele jaren werkervaring zijn dit de specifieke skills die we zoeken:


* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met Python en PySpark.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met een Spark-omgeving als Azure Data Factory en/of Synapse.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met SQL DB en T-SQL.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 2 jaar) met PowerBI.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met Azure DevOps CI/CD processen.
* Ervaring met infra-as-code (IaC) in Bicep en Azure DevOps pipelines.
* Ervaring met verschillende data architecturen en modellen zoals DataVault, Star Schema en Data Mesh.

Maar dat is zeker niet het enige. De Rabobank is een coöperatieve bank met een missie. Samen met klanten, leden en partners zet de Rabobank zich in voor een sterkere leefomgeving en voor de grote maatschappelijke uitdagingen van nu, met als uitgangspunt dat er samen meer bereikt wordt dan alleen. Die missie kan alleen waargemaakt worden doordat Rabobank een krachtige bank is die efficiënt werkt.


Daarnaast is Rabobank actief betrokken bij veel maatschappelijke initiatieven. Een deel van de winst wordt geïnvesteerd in de samenleving. Verder weg, door te zorgen dat boeren een eerlijke prijs krijgen voor hun producten. En dichtbij, door in heel Nederland samen buurten beter te maken. Zo’n 1250 organisaties in sport en cultuur die voor veel mensen een tweede thuis zijn worden ondersteund. Een ander voorbeeld is het project met Humanitas, waarin mensen worden geholpen die financiële problemen hebben hun thuisadministratie op orde te krijgen. Een derde voorbeeld is dat samen met Vluchtelingenwerk Nederland 1.500 vluchtelingen worden geholpen bij het vinden van een goed passende baan.


Om haar kerntaak blijvend te realiseren heeft Rabobank een ambitieus plan opgesteld waarin het creëren van een optimale Engineering Journey een belangrijke pijler is.

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

As a data platform engineer, you will be working on our data platform named Thor. With Thor, we want to create a self-service, metadata driven data platform where data producers can share their data with the data consumers without the platform team being the bottleneck. This means that we are working hard to enable our users so they can do as much as possible themselves and we can focus on improving and optimizing our pipelines and codebase.

 **A few cool new features we have recently implemented:**

* Smart Scheduling that dynamically changes data pipeline configuration based on historical statistics
* A versioned data platform that allows the product to scale to other brands
* Documentation that writes itself

Een rol met impact: die heb je als data-analist bij ons Sanctieteam in Utrecht zeker. Jij draagt bij aan een rechtvaardig en integer financieel stelsel. En tilt de Volksbank op het gebied van data naar een nog hoger niveau.


Jij speelt als de data-analist in ons Sanctieteam een sleutelrol in het screeningsproces. Dat doe je door op basis van requirements diverse databestanden te analyseren en zo afwijkende transacties en risicovolle (potentiële) klanten in kaart te brengen. Belangrijk, want bij de Volksbank willen we weten wie onze klanten zijn. Bijvoorbeeld om snel in te kunnen grijpen als we met iemand zaken doen die op een sanctielijst staat. Het aantal sancties en het aantal transacties groeien snel, waardoor een goede screening hoog op onze prioriteitenlijst staat. Daarnaast verandert wet- en regelgeving regelmatig.


Data zijn voor ons van doorslaggevend belang voor het kennen van onze (potentiële) klanten. Daarom werken we steeds meer datagedreven. Jij bouwt naast je analysewerk volop mee aan een datagedreven organisatie, waarbij je focust op een optimale inrichting van onze screening. Zo adviseer je over verbeteringen in onze systemen, processen en procedures om de screening zo effectief en efficiënt mogelijk uit te voeren.


Je krijgt veel vrijheid en autonomie, want wij werken agile. Jouw visie op data telt echt mee en is bepalend voor je team én de hele bank. Bij ons tref je ook de ideale omgeving om verder te groeien binnen jouw vakgebied. Verspreid over de hele organisatie werken namelijk data-analisten die je ontmoet in ons gilde. Hier delen we best practices en vragen we elkaar om hulp.


Hier kom je te werken


Het Sanctieteam is jouw thuisbasis. We zijn een multidisciplinair team van 16 collega’s: inhoudelijke experts, IT-specialisten en kenners van processen. In korte tijd zijn we gegroeid met veel nieuwe collega’s. Daar merk je trouwens weinig van; we werken samen alsof we elkaar al jaren kennen. We komen in elk geval één keer per week samen op kantoor in Utrecht.


Jouw kwaliteiten


Hoe jij bekend staat? Als doortastend en communicatief sterk. Zo vertaal je ruwe gegevens efficiënt naar heldere informatie waar je collega’s écht iets mee kunnen. Met je scherpe analytische blik ben je continu op zoek naar verbeterpotentieel. Bovendien werk je graag samen en houd je, ook onder druk, het hoofd koel.


Verder heb je:

* Hbo werk- en denkniveau
* Ervaring met grote datasets en het opschonen en transformeren van data.
* Ervaring met programmeertalen, zoals Python/PySpark, SQL en R.

-------------------


Are you eager to contribute to a still further improvement of ASML’s nanolithography technology, and are you fascinated by partial differential equations (PDEs) and machine learning?  

If yes, then this vacancy, a cooperation between ASML Research and TU/e’s Centre for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications, might be something for you.


**Job Description**  

Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) The PhD position is in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) of Eindhoven University of Technology. M&CS is the largest department of TU/e and one of the largest departments in the Netherlands in the area of mathematics and computer science. M&CS has research collaborations with the other departments at TU/e, with many companies in the Eindhoven area, and with universities and companies in the Netherlands and abroad. M&CS contributes to science and engineering by performing both fundamental and applied research. Through M&CS’s close relationship with the high-tech industry in the Eindhoven area, staff and students contribute directly to the development of relevant technological innovations. M&CS is organized in three different domains: mathematics, computer science, and data science. Each domain consists of several clusters. The mathematics domain has three clusters: CASA (Center for Analysis, Scientific Computing, and Applications), DM (Discrete Mathematics), and SPOR (Statistics, Probability, and Operations Research). The domain of computer science is organized into five different clusters: ALGA (Algorithms, Geometry and Applications), FSA (Formal System Analysis), IRIS (Interconnected Resource-aware Intelligent Systems), SEC (Security), and SET (Software Engineering and Technology). Data science has three clusters: DAI (Data and Artificial Intelligence), PA (Process Analytics), and VIS (Visualization). The PhD position for which this call is, is in the cluster CASA.


*Center for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications (CASA)*  

The research objective of CASA is to develop new and improve existing mathematical (both analytical and numerical) methods for a wide range of applications in science and engineering. Mathematics research within CASA is often driven by models from science and engineering, for instance by mathematical expressions of physical laws (often systems of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations). Stimulated by the immense growth in the availability and use of data, mathematics in CASA is also becoming data-driven, with a crucial role in this for machine learning. There is enormous potential for the use of data and machine learning (particularly neural networks) in analysis and scientific computing, in combination with the use of first-principle models. CASA is continuing its longstanding expertise and success in variational calculus, functional analysis, numerical methods for partial differential equations, numerical linear algebra, and model-order reduction methods while extending its research into the direction of data science, machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and high-performance computing.


*Knowledge and Physics-Informed Artificial Intelligence (KPAI)*  

The availability and importance of data for the design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance of  

semiconductor machinery has increased significantly. Classical engineering methods can be augmented by  

data taken from observations in machines or from documented knowledge sources based upon earlier  

design and manufacturing steps. The translation of these diverse forms of information requires novel  

approaches that extract meaningful outputs, which are then utilizable for engineering goals.  

From the national program TKI (Top consortia for Knowledge and Innovation), funding has been acquired for  

the research program Knowledge and Physics Informed Artificial Intelligence (KPAI), including two PhD  

projects, each focused on a different type of source information. The program KPAI will be co-funded by and  

carried out in cooperation with ASML Research. The two PhD projects in the KPAI program are:


* Extraction and representation in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the physics governing semiconductor manufacturing processes (model discovery).
* Information extraction from semi-structured sources of information and their representation in a knowledge graph and a large language model for trustworthy conversational AI.


Both projects will bring these two forms of information together in such a way that a tool is realized for quick support to engineers. The first of above two projects, for which the present call is, will be carried out in the cluster CASA, the second in the cluster DAI.


**Job requirements**
--------------------


We are looking for a talented, enthusiastic PhD candidate meeting the following requirements:


* Master degree in (applied) mathematics or related discipline.
* Experience with numerically solving ordinary and partial differential equations.
* Experience with optimization methods and interest in machine learning.

* Creative pro-active team player with good analytical skills.
* Research-oriented attitude.
* Ability to work in interdisciplinary team and to collaborate with industrial partner.
* Motivated to develop teaching skills and coach students.
* Fluent in spoken and written English.

**Conditions of employment**

-------------------


From a scientific perspective, contact line motion remains a challenging subject for both theoretical, experimental and numerical fluid mechanics due to the occurrence of a shear stress singularity at the three-phase contact line. In technological applications such as immersion lithography, it is desirable to displace liquid across a partially wettable but heterogeneous (wafer) surface as quickly as possible and without leaving any residue. In this project you will investigate the interplay between capillary and inertial aspects of contact line motion and its interaction with non-flat surface topography and variable surface composition. You will specifically consider the critical substrate speed – corresponding to the transition towards droplet shedding or the entrainment of thin films on the surface – as a function of the geometrical and compositional surface parameters. You will also study the dynamics of splashing, which occurs on topographically patterned surfaces, when an array of high-speed gas-jets is used to displace and control the receding side of the liquid meniscus.


This project consists of a combination of experiments and numerical simulations. The experiments will involve high-speed visualization of contact-line dynamics on suitably prepared surfaces. You will study surface heterogeneities both regarding composition and topography and systematically vary the dimensions, shapes and amplitudes of the patterns. The numerical simulations will be based on existing finite-element, lattice Boltzmann and volume-of-fluid codes.


You will become a member of the group *Fluids & Flows* of the Department of Applied Physics and contribute to our research line of *Micro- and Nanofluidics*. This project is part of a larger research program that involves close collaboration with the University of Twente and the research division of ASML. Moreover, it is embedded in the J.M.Burgerscentrum – the Dutch National Research School on Fluid Mechanics. It offers the unique opportunity for you to do high-level fundamental research with clear application-inspired and technology-relevant aspects. Your results will help improve immersion lithography, which is a fabrication technology for semiconductor devices that are at the heart of all modern technology (e.g. computers, smart phones, electrical cars, …).


Besides research you will also contribute to education within our group and the Department of Applied Physics. You will guide and supervise BSc and MSc students in their research projects. Other assistance in education, e.g. in BSc-level courses, is usually limited to around 5% of your contract time. Note that if you are specifically interested in teaching and education, there is the option for a 1-year extension of your PhD studentship. Your teaching and education tasks will then amount to a time equivalent of more than a full contract year during your PhD project. Please express your interest to the vacancy holder/supervisor in charge.


**Job requirements**
--------------------


For the experimental position, we are looking for an enthusiastic PhD-student with an excellent background in fluid dynamics. Typically, you have an MSc degree in (applied) physics, mechanical or chemical engineering. Prior experience with experiment design, instrument control, data acquisition and image analysis are assets. You should be able to work in a team and have good written and oral communication skills in English.


**Conditions of employment**
----------------------------


A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:


* Full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.
* Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the *Collective Labour Agreement* for Dutch Universities, scale P (min. €2,770 max. €3,539).
* A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
* High-quality training programs and other support to grow into a self-aware, autonomous scientific researcher. At TU/e we challenge you to take charge of your own learning process.
* An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
* An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
* A Staff Immigration Team and a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) for international candidates.

We are looking for a researcher carrying out part of a project on the socio-ecological impact of postgrowth housing scenarios. The overall project is intended to study the relation between income, housing tenure and ecological footprint, as well as to build possible scenarios of a socially just and ecologically sustainable housing system. The aim is to demonstrate differences in environmental impact that different existing and future housing models have. We will start with The Netherlands and them work at EU-level.  


The project includes two different sub-studies:
* ***A postgrowth assessment of dominant housing systems***: this study will deploy LCA-based urban metabolism models to assess the long-term performance of the existing housing stock. It will focus on the income-to-environmental impact of existing housing to show the relation between income, housing type and carbon, material and land use footprint.
* ***Scenarios for postgrowth housing systems***: this study will assess the projected environmental impact of prototypes of postgrowth housing. The team will develop models that combine different measures and elaborate on possible scenarios. These prototypes are defined from the literature and from a preliminary analysis of existing real-life examples. They include eco-communities, urban housing cooperatives and large-scale social housing.
  


The researcher will work with an interdisciplinary team formed by Dr. Federico Savini (spatial planning, Principal Investigator) and Dr. Cody Hochstenbach (human geography, housing studies) at the University of Amsterdam, Mira Kopp (urban industrial ecology, Mercator Research Institute, TU Berlin) and Dr. Stefano Merciai (industrial ecology, University of Leiden, Aarus University).

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



Bedrijfsvoering zorgt ervoor dat de IND als concern en de keten als geheel hun taken zo goed mogelijk kunnen uitvoeren. De directie wil haar klanten (alle IND-collega’s en vele ketenpartners) snel en vakkundig bedienen: met een brede blik op het gebied van HR, financiën, control, Lean, interne audits, huisvesting en facilitaire voorzieningen. Dat betekent dat wij weten wat onze klanten nu maar ook in de toekomst nodig hebben, zodat we duurzame en toekomstbestendige (integrale) adviezen en diensten leveren.



De directie Bedrijfsvoering bestaat uit de directeur en een aantal MT-leden, die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de onderliggende afdelingen van BV. De directeur en MT-leden worden ondersteund door managementondersteuners. De inhoudelijke ondersteuning van (plaatsvervangend) directeur en de overige MT-leden vindt plaats door directie- en afdelingssecretarissen. De managementondersteuners, de secretarissen en de informatiemanagers vormen de Staf van de directie Bedrijfsvoering.


**Afdeling Financiën en Business Informatie**



De afdeling Financiën en Business Informatie (FBI) is een afdeling waarin alle onderdelen van de financiële functie bij elkaar zijn gebracht. Onze ambitie is om de businesspartner van de IND te zijn. Om dat doel te bereiken gaan we de komende jaren onze toegevoegde waarde verbeteren en bouwen we aan een stevig financieel fundament. Dat betekent dat we samen met de business de (financiële) sturing gaan verbeteren door proactief en met kennis van zaken mee te denken, bijvoorbeeld over een efficiëntere inrichting van klantprocessen, handhaving en risicogericht sturen. Dit is ook nodig in een context waarin sprake is van afnemende middelen enerzijds en een continue vraag om kwaliteitsverbetering anderzijds.



De afdeling kent vijf teams: Inkoop Servicedesk, Business Informatie Centrum, Concern, Control en Verbijzonderde Interne Controle en Innovatie.


**Business Informatie Centrum**



Het Business Informatie Centrum (BIC) levert vele standaardrapportages, zoals dashboards met in-, door- en uitstroomgegevens, maar levert ook rapportages op basis van ad-hoc-vragen. De dashboards en rapportages bevatten financiële gegevens, kwantitatieve analyses, voorspelmodellen zoals klantprofielen en andere kwantitatieve data. Directies kunnen mede hierop hun verbeterplannen baseren. Het BIC werkt steeds nauw samen met haar afnemers en ontwikkelt producten die deze afnemers toegevoegde waarde opleveren. Tegelijk worden de producten zo veel mogelijk universeel opgezet, zodat ze breed toepasbaar zijn. Wij zijn ook verantwoordelijk voor het beheer en de doorontwikkeling van het datawarehouse van de IND. Daarbinnen valt ook het bundelen van meerdere informatiebronnen en het opleveren van nieuwe rapportages die de bedrijfsvoering van de IND ondersteunen.



**Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst**
--------------------------------------



Een vluchteling die niet veilig is in eigen land. Een ingenieur die zijn kennis in Nederland in de praktijk komt brengen. En een gezin dat elkaar na jaren weer in de armen kan sluiten. Wat ze met elkaar gemeen hebben? De IND beoordeelt hun verzoeken om in Nederland te mogen wonen of Nederlander te willen worden.



De IND voert het vreemdelingenbeleid in Nederland uit. Dat betekent dat we alle verblijfsaanvragen beoordelen. Het kan daarbij gaan om vluchtelingen die niet veilig zijn in eigen land en daarom hier asiel aanvragen. Of om mensen die hier willen werken, studeren, of een gezin vormen met iemand die hier al woont. Maar het kan ook gaan om mensen die hier al zo lang wonen dat zij zich Nederlander voelen en die daarom via een naturalisatieverzoek een Nederlands paspoort aanvragen.



De IND wil een compacte en wendbare uitvoeringsorganisatie zijn met hoogwaardige kennis op het vreemdelingendomein en met oog voor de menselijke maat. De IND moet kunnen inspelen op wisselende eisen en omstandigheden en tegelijkertijd moet de kwaliteit van dienstverlening voorop blijven staan. Dit vraagt om een proactieve organisatie die zich voortdurend ontwikkelt. Daarvoor zijn medewerkers nodig die dit willen en kunnen ondersteunen. Medewerkers die breed inzetbaar zijn en die willen investeren in hun persoonlijke ontwikkeling. De IND investeert graag in deze medewerkers!

The Rainforest Alliance is creating a more sustainable world by using social and market forces to protect nature and improve the lives of farmers and forest communities. To achieve our mission, we partner with diverse allies around the world to drive positive change across global supply chains and in many of our most critically important natural landscapes.  

  

Our alliance spans 70 countries and includes farmers and forest communities, companies, governments, civil society, and millions of individuals. Together we work to protect forests and biodiversity, take action on climate, and promote the rights and improve the livelihoods of rural people.  

  

As an international nonprofit organization with more than 30 years of experience in sustainability transformation, we understand that the social and economic well-being of rural communities is tightly connected to ecosystem health. This knowledge has shaped our rigorous programs to advance sustainable land-use and commodity production.  

  

At the Rainforest Alliance we combat climate change, protect forests and biodiversity, promote human rights, and improve livelihoods. The enormity of the social and environmental challenges we are facing requires working together in a broad alliance. This is why we bring farmers, forest communities, companies, and consumers together to change the way the world produces, sources, and consumes.  

  

**Why**  

To protect nature and improve lives it’s becoming increasingly urgent that we approach the way we use our land and produce food and other products in more sustainable ways. For this to succeed we need to fundamentally change the way that businesses operate and source, and the choices we all make as consumers.

Our growing global alliance aims to transform our relationship with our natural resources and each other, to create a better future for people and nature together.

Je vertaalt data naar concrete inzichten waarmee de redactie nog meer impact kan maken, duikt in de cijfers om trends te duiden en geeft journalisten advies hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter op de bezoeker afstemmen.  

  

**Functieomschrijving**  

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van het AD in Rotterdam. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data. Dat betekent dat je met cijfers bezig bent, maar ook veel met redactieleden overlegt en ze traint in hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter online presenteren. Je analyseert, rapporteert en geeft dus advies.

  


Je gaat op zoek naar antwoorden op vragen als: Waarom haken mensen af in een artikel? Wat is de ideale mix aan verhalen? Wat is de optimale spreiding van artikelen over de dag? En waarom stijgt of zakt het bezoek de afgelopen weken?

  


De adviezen geef je op drie ‘snelheden’: live, in dag- en weekrapporten en in losse analyses. Op de dag zelf kijk je met een schuin oog mee naar de cijfers en deel je belangrijke actiegerichte inzichten met de redactie. In dag- en weekrapporten geef je duiding aan de cijfers. Naast de dagelijkse taken voer je ook regelmatig diepgravende analyses uit.

  


Je bent een belangrijke sparringpartner voor de chefs en hoofdredactie bij AD en werkt nauw met hen samen.  

  

**Jouw team**  

Het team Redactionele Inzichten & Groei (RI&G) werkt over Nederland én België. Met in Nederland 17 redactie-analisten verspreid over diverse nieuwsmerken. We werken aan creatieve oplossingen voor complexe vraagstukken. Dat lukt alleen met een fijne werksfeer en met goed teamwork. Naast redactie-analisten zijn er diverse centrale rollen in het team die jou bij je werk zullen ondersteunen.  

  

**Functieprofiel**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.


**VOORWAARDEN**


* salaris, passend bij jouw ervaring;
* 38-urige werkweek, minder uur in overleg;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;
* ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden d.m.v. opleidingen en trainingen;
* We geloven in een gezonde werk-privébalans waarbij je voldoende ruimte krijgt voor jouw welzijn en flexibel werken.

**Wat doe je als Informatiemanager bij IVO Rechtspraak?**

Jouw werk is van grote invloed op de rechtspraak. En daarmee op het leven van mensen. Want de rechtspraak kan niet zonder goede informatie. En die moet voor álle betrokkenen eenvoudig beschikbaar zijn. Van rechters tot burgers die door een geschil of misdaad in een rechtszaak zijn verwikkeld. Jij speelt een centrale rol in die informatievoorziening. Een opdracht op niveau, waarbij de prioriteiten die jij stelt of laat stellen het verschil maken!


### **Hoe je werk eruitziet**



Ieder jaar zijn er zo’n 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken in Nederland. Binnen IVO Rechtspraak hebben we verschillende teams die zich bezighouden met informatievoorziening. In elk team stuurt een portefeuillehouder namens de business, met een rechtsgebied als focus: straf, civiel en bestuur, toezicht, familie en jeugd, Data en Registers en tot slot bedrijfsvoering. Jij bent de rechterhand van de portefeuillehouder en start bij het IV-team Bedrijfsvoering. De portefeuille Bedrijfsvoering levert generieke diensten aan Rechtspraak collega's en externe partijen, zoals burgers, rechtzoekenden, journalisten en ketenpartners. De portefeuille is onderverdeeld in de volgende vijf thema's waarbinnen alle verschillende applicaties van Bedrijfsvoering zijn ondergebracht; klantgerichte communicatie en kennisportalen, slim samenwerken en online zitten, creëren en delen van uitspraken, facilitering bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen en digitale informatiehuishouding



Samen met je collega-informatiemanagers breng jij in kaart welke informatie nodig is om rechtszaken en bedrijfsondersteunende processen optimaal te laten verlopen. Daar maak je voor jouw thema beleid op, ook voor de lange termijn. En je ziet toe op de uitvoering van dat beleid. Zo bouw je mee aan de digitale toekomst van de rechtspraak in ons land.



Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware twee talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.



Zit je als informatiemanager graag dicht bij het vuur? En wil je de richting van de rechtspraak mee helpen bepalen? Stuur dan direct je sollicitatie!

Je vertaalt data naar concrete inzichten waarmee de redactie nog meer impact kan maken, duikt in de cijfers om trends te duiden en geeft journalisten advies hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter op de bezoeker afstemmen.  

  

**FUNCTIEOMSCHRIJVING**  

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van de PZC in Middelburg. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data. Dat betekent dat je met cijfers bezig bent, maar ook veel met redactieleden overlegt en ze traint in hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter online presenteren. Je analyseert, rapporteert en geeft dus advies.


Je gaat op zoek naar antwoorden op vragen als: Waarom haken mensen af in een artikel? Wat is de ideale mix aan verhalen? Wat is de optimale spreiding van artikelen over de dag? En waarom stijgt of zakt het bezoek de afgelopen weken?


De adviezen geef je op drie ‘snelheden’: live, in dag- en weekrapporten en in grotere analyses. Op de dag zelf kijk je met een schuin oog mee naar de cijfers en deel je belangrijke actiegerichte inzichten met de redactie. In dag- en weekrapporten geef je duiding aan de cijfers. Naast de dagelijkse taken voer je ook regelmatig diepgravende analyses uit.



Je bent een belangrijke sparringpartner voor de chefs en hoofdredactie bij de PZC en werkt nauw met hen samen.

**FUNCTIEPROFIEL**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.


**VOORWAARDEN**

* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;

Vertaal beleid naar de praktijk. En draag bij aan de informatievoorziening rond 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken per jaar.**


**Wat doe je als Informatiemanager bij IVO Rechtspraak?**
---------------------------------------------------------


Jouw werk is van grote invloed op de rechtspraak. En daarmee op het leven van mensen. Want de rechtspraak kan niet zonder goede informatie. En die moet voor álle betrokkenen eenvoudig beschikbaar zijn. Van rechters tot burgers die door een geschil of misdaad in een rechtszaak zijn verwikkeld. Jij speelt een centrale rol in die informatievoorziening. Een opdracht op niveau, waarbij de prioriteiten die jij stelt of laat stellen het verschil maken!


### **Hoe je werk eruitziet**


Ieder jaar zijn er zo’n 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken in Nederland. Binnen IVO Rechtspraak hebben we verschillende teams die zich bezighouden met informatievoorziening. In elk team stuurt een portefeuillehouder namens de business, met een rechtsgebied als focus: straf, civiel en bestuur, toezicht, familie en jeugd, Data en Registers en tot slot bedrijfsvoering. Jij bent de rechterhand van de portefeuillehouder en start bij het IV-team Bedrijfsvoering. De portefeuille Bedrijfsvoering levert generieke diensten aan Rechtspraak collega's en externe partijen, zoals burgers, rechtzoekenden, journalisten en ketenpartners. De portefeuille is onderverdeeld in de volgende vijf thema's waarbinnen alle verschillende applicaties van Bedrijfsvoering zijn ondergebracht; klantgerichte communicatie en kennisportalen, slim samenwerken en online zitten, creëren en delen van uitspraken, facilitering bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen en digitale informatiehuishouding


Samen met je collega-informatiemanagers breng jij in kaart welke informatie nodig is om rechtszaken en bedrijfsondersteunende processen optimaal te laten verlopen. Daar maak je voor jouw thema beleid op, ook voor de lange termijn. En je ziet toe op de uitvoering van dat beleid. Zo bouw je mee aan de digitale toekomst van de rechtspraak in ons land.


Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware twee talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.


Zit je als informatiemanager graag dicht bij het vuur? En wil je de richting van de rechtspraak mee helpen bepalen? Stuur dan direct je sollicitatie!

Het Arbo-team is onderdeel van het professionals portfolio van VMN Media, dat bestaat uit de redacties van PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb. Er is nauwe samenwerking met de redacties, zo zitten we iedere donderdag samen op kantoor en wisselen we regelmatig kennis met elkaar uit.  

**Hybride werkvorm** – Minimaal 1 dag werken we in ons prachtige kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van de tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.  

**Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Arbo is sinds kort onder een compleet nieuw team met een nieuwe contentstrategie en er is veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën.  

**Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten van wie je kunt leren. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn of onderzoeksjournalistiek.  

**Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring met uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een individueel keuze-budget dat je naar eigen inzicht kunt besteden en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten!


Verder nog handig om te weten: het gaat om een functie van 36 uur per week. Het kantoor van VMN media staat in Zeist.

  

**Je bent overtuigd**  

Solliciteer dan direct! Heb je vragen over de procedure of over VMN media als werkgever? Neem dan contact op met onze Corporate Recruiter Jasper Magis via 06 15 64 39 50 of jaspermagis@vmnmedia.nl.
