**The Opportunity: Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst**


We are looking for an experienced Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst to take a lead role in transforming data into actionable insights that drive strategic decision\-making across the company. In this hands\-on role, you will design and deliver business\-critical dashboards and analytical reports that inform how we improve patient access and grow our business. As a senior individual contributor on our Data \& Analytics team, you’ll work alongside a Data Engineer and fellow Analysts within our Product \& Engineering organization. You will collaborate cross\-functionally with stakeholders in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial, and Product, becoming a go\-to expert for data insights.


**What You'll be Doing:**


In your first 3–6 months, you will hit the ground running by spearheading the creation of several high\-impact dashboards, including:

* Client Program Performance Dashboards – to monitor and visualize our patient programs' performance and identify opportunities to improve outcomes.
* Revenue Tracking Dashboards – to provide real\-time visibility into revenue streams and financial KPIs, helping steer commercial strategy.
* Patient Source Attribution Dashboards – to trace and illustrate how patients find our platform (using tools like Sankey diagrams for flow visualization), informing marketing and outreach efforts.

**This is the right opportunity for you if:**

* Design, build, and maintain interactive dashboards and reports in Tableau (and other BI tools) to track key metrics across the business. You will own end\-to\-end dashboard development – from gathering requirements to data modeling and visualization – ensuring stakeholders have self\-service access to up\-to\-date insights.
* Deliver actionable insights for growth: Analyze operational and marketing data (from MySQL/PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases, Airflow, Excel, etc.) to understand key performance drivers. Translate data into clear findings and recommendations that drive user acquisition, patient engagement, and sustainable business growth.
* Be the analytical partner for leadership: Serve as a point of contact for the leadership team on all things data. Provide in\-depth reporting, ad\-hoc analysis, and executive\-friendly dashboards that inform strategic decisions and highlight trends in business performance.
* Focus on data quality and accuracy: Work closely with our Data Engineer and product engineers to ensure we have reliable, well\-structured data. Help maintain and validate data models, databases and data pipelines so that reports are accurate and reflect the single source of truth. Identify any data gaps or integrity issues and collaborate on solutions.
* Drive performance improvements: Monitor key KPIs (such as program success metrics, funnel conversion rates, revenue metrics) and proactively identify operational bottlenecks or areas for improvement. Provide insight\-driven suggestions to optimize workflows, improve patient recruitment, or streamline processes.
* Cross\-functional collaboration: Partner with teams in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial and Product to understand their analytics needs. Support these stakeholders by building custom reports or exploratory analysis, and ensure they can leverage your dashboards for day\-to\-day decision making. For example, you might deep\-dive into marketing funnel data to advise the Growth team, or analyze operational turnaround times to assist the Operations team.
* Advanced analysis and data exploration: Use Python (with pandas, numpy, etc.) and SQL for deeper ad\-hoc analyses, data discovery, and data preparation. When questions go beyond existing reports, you’ll dig into raw data to uncover insights, validate hypotheses, and prepare datasets for further analysis.
* Mentorship and best practices: As a senior analyst, mentor and guide junior analysts on the team. Review their work, share knowledge of best practices in analytics, SQL querying, and visualization. Lead by example in documentation and reproducibility. You will also enable business users’ self\-service by training stakeholders on how to use established dashboards and reporting tools effectively.
* Shape data strategy: Contribute to our overall data strategy by identifying new metrics or analytics opportunities that can drive value. Advocate for a data\-driven mindset across the organization. You’ll play a key role in evolving our analytics capabilities (for instance, suggesting new BI features or improving reporting processes) to support a scaling, high\-growth environment.

**You Have:**

* Experience: 5\+ years in data analytics, business intelligence, or a similar role, with a track record of handling complex data projects and delivering insights to business stakeholders. Experience in a growth\-stage tech company or digital health environment is a plus.
* Strong proficiency in SQL (ability to write complex queries in MySQL/PostgreSQL). Hands\-on experience with data visualization tools, especially Tableau (or similar BI platforms), to create dynamic dashboards. Familiarity with NoSQL databases and tools like Airflow is beneficial. Advanced Excel skills for quick analysis and data prep.
* Experience using Python for data analysis tasks – e.g. data cleaning, exploration, and validation using libraries such as pandas or numpy. Must be comfortable scripting to manipulate data when needed.
* Present data in a clear and compelling way. Experience creating a variety of chart types and visuals – from standard bar/line charts to more advanced visuals like Sankey diagrams or funnel charts – to illustrate user flows and attribution. An eye for design and attention to detail in dashboards ensuring they are accurate, easy to interpret, and visually engaging.
* Analytical Mindset: Excellent analytical and problem\-solving skills. Capable of interpreting complex datasets, identifying trends and outliers, and connecting the dots between data and business outcomes. You approach problems with curiosity and a hypothesis\-driven mindset.
* Business Acumen: Strong understanding of business metrics and growth drivers. Ability to translate business questions from non\-technical stakeholders into analytical approaches, and then translate back findings into business terms. Experience working on metrics like revenue, conversion funnels, customer acquisition cost, etc., is highly valued.
* Exceptional communication skills in English (our company language). You can distill complex analyses into clear insights and narratives for different audiences. Comfortable presenting findings to senior leadership and guiding discussions on data.
* Collaboration: Proven ability to work cross\-functionally and build positive relationships with diverse teams — from operations managers to product designers. You’re a team player who can align data projects with the needs of multiple departments and manage stakeholder expectations.
* Leadership \& Mentorship: Demonstrated experience mentoring junior analysts or leading analytical projects. You enjoy helping others grow their skills and can influence without formal authority. You’re enthusiastic about sharing knowledge and establishing best practices for analytics within a team.
* Self\-Driven \& Organized: Thrives in a fast\-paced, high\-growth environment. Able to manage and prioritize multiple projects and requests, deliver on deadlines, and adapt to evolving business needs. You take ownership of your work and proactively seek out ways to add value.
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in a relevant field (e.g. Data Science, Statistics, Business, Computer Science, or similar) is preferred, or equivalent practical experience in data analysis roles.

**What we offer**

* Impactful work that helps patients gain access to potentially lifesaving treatments.

In this thesis, you will generate synthetic training data by transforming low\-poly 3D models of hands and feet into photorealistic images with labeled key points. Using techniques like pix2pix GANs, you’ll explore and optimize the process to create a diverse and enriched dataset, enhancing pose estimation models for AI\-driven Parkinson’s symptom analysis.**

**Areas of Interest:** Generative AI, Controllable Image Generation, Few\-shot Learning


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


The examination of Parkinson’s symptoms is highly labor\-intensive, as it requires multiple trained neurologists to thoroughly analyze hand and leg movements. A group of hospitals aims to extend Parkinson’s treatment in the Netherlands to regions where such care is currently unavailable due to a shortage of trained neurologists. To achieve this, they want to make a pre\-selection through the help of AI on a smartphone. Part of the solution is a pose estimation model to track hand and foot movements. However, the current dataset for training the model is neither large nor diverse enough. The goal is to enrich the dataset with highly varied data while minimizing the need for manual effort.


Important features for detecting hands and feet could be better balanced by enriching the training dataset with synthetic data. To prevent manual labeling of the training data, it would be ideal if the ground truth for tracking key points is synthesized along with the training images. By converting low\-poly 3D models with key point rigs into photorealistic images, a synthetic dataset of labeled training images could be generated. Your task will be to investigate how to transform low\-poly models into photorealistic images using AI.

**The Assignment**
------------------


You will create a training dataset consisting of low\-poly 3D body rigs, focusing on the hands and feet. Next, you will explore transforming these low\-poly models into photorealistic images using a pix2pix GAN model. You may also fine\-tune the model to optimize hyperparameters for generating the best results. Your findings will be documented in a thesis and presented during your thesis defense.

However, these systems present challenges, particularly with model agnostic explanations which are more approximations. This includes global and local explanations, with local ones possibly misleading due to their narrow focus. Effective testing is crucial to verify if explanations are sensible to experts, consistent across different outcomes, and to understand when they might change.**

**Areas of Interest:** Artificial Intelligence, Explainable AI


Explainable machine learning and artificial intelligence models have been used to justify a model’s decision\-making process. This added transparency aims to help improve user performance and understanding of the underlying model. However, in practice, explainable systems face many open questions and challenges.


Model agnostic explanations are more approximations. In general there are two kinds of explanations: global and local explanations. For the latter, there’s the possibility that the explanation is off, because it only looks at the local inference. It’s possible that for opposite inference, we get exactly the same explanations. To get proper explanations we’ll need to be able to test them. Are the explanations sensible to business experts and aren’t there any same explanations for opposite outcomes? And do we know when explanations will change?

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

We’re crafting a metric that measures how achievable AI\-generated advice is—for real people. Think of it as teaching AI common sense; for instance, you can’t just age a decade instantly. Your challenge: integrate advanced language models like GPT to gauge if a “what if” scenario is useful or just a tech fantasy. Join us in shaping a more sensible, user\-centric AI future.**

**Areas of Interest:** XAI/Explainable AI, LLMs/Large Language Models, ChatGPT, NLP/Natural Language Processing


Counterfactual explanations are considered an intuitive and user\-friendly form of explainable AI. A counterfactual explanation proposes minimal changes to the input data that would lead to a different model output. As an example, a bank could make use of a model to determine if a customer can get a loan or not. If a customer was denied a loan, a counterfactual explanation could tell them that, for instance, “if their savings were increased by 10\.000€, they could get the loan”.


However, counterfactual explanations are not aware of the semantics of the input features. It might be that the minimal change for a customer to get a loan is to “increase their age from 25 to 35 years old” which, from a human perspective, is evidently unfeasible in a short time span.

**The Assignment**
------------------


In this project, we would like you to design a new evaluation metric to automatically determine the practicality of counterfactuals, that is, how attainable a counterfactual explanation is (or if it is even humanly attainable). Since the determination of practicality involves semantic understanding of the input features, our idea would be to leverage GPT and/or other large language model\-based technologies to accomplish this.


A user study could be conducted initially following the methodology proposed by Spreitzer et al (1\) to evaluate the practicality of different state\-of\-the\-art counterfactual techniques. The user study can then be extended to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed metric compared to the human evaluations.

 What we offer
   

  

**About Us**
 We are Xomnia, the AI consulting company. We’re curious problem solvers who believe data will change the way we live, work and communicate. Being at the forefront of this revolutionary change in a sustainable, positive way is what drives us.
   

  

 We solve challenging data science and engineering projects, from start to finish. From developing an application for real\-time fraud detection on Google Cloud Platform, to setting up a customized recommender engine in an existing Microsoft Azure environment \- we develop and deploy tailor\-made data science solutions.
   

  

 Xomnia started in 2013 in one room in the heart of Amsterdam. These days we take up nearly two houses. But more than just a workspace, we're a community that values authenticity. Here, everyone is encouraged to be themselves, to learn, and to have fun in the process.
   

  

 Representing over 20 nationalities, our team values the unique cultural perspective that each individual brings to the table. Moreover, with the Dutch tech sector seeing a female representation around 11%, we are proud that over 30% of our workforce is female. Nevertheless, we recognize that there is more to be done, and we continue working to overcome barriers that still exist.
   

  

 We encourage all candidates to apply, and we don’t discriminate based on race, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age. However, a reality that we face is that many of our clients prefer to communicate in Dutch, making Dutch proficiency essential for some roles. Additionally, while we wish that we could sponsor visas for everyone, there are instances when it is not feasible.
   

  

 If you're experienced, passionate, and align with our values, we want to hear from you.",Information Technology & Services,https://nl.linkedin.com/company/xomnia,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEMxcvPDbBSiQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1724141336408/xomnia_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=0v5TZXJBHiKRXgKL2iodt4MaQoB-A_OFbbEE8e8kKF0,,,,,,,,,,,,ai engineer,linkedin,en

Our clients offer top\-tier pay for top\-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?
   

  

 Master AI\-Driven Development or Step Aside. For Engineers Who Ship, Not Talk.
   

  

 Most development teams still operate in the dark ages—manual code reviews, reactive debugging, and AI as an afterthought. At Trilogy, we've rewritten the rules. Our entire engineering ecosystem breathes AI—from ideation to deployment, bug detection to optimization. This isn't about occasionally using AI tools; it's about fundamentally transforming how software gets built.
   

  

 We're seeking elite developers who refuse to accept the status quo of traditional software engineering. You'll deconstruct established B2B products and rebuild them as cloud\-native powerhouses with AI intelligence embedded at every level. You'll deploy features that leverage cutting\-edge retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG), automate defect detection, and deliver flawlessly—zero downtime, zero compromises.
   

  

 If you're ready to operate at the bleeding edge where AI meets software engineering, this position will accelerate your career trajectory. If you prefer architecture debates over shipping code or manual processes over automation, look elsewhere.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Harness advanced RAG vector stores and AI analysis tools to systematically identify, diagnose, and eliminate product defects with unprecedented efficiency
* Architect and implement AI development agents that transform how features are designed, developed, and deployed across cloud\-native applications
* Drive enterprise\-grade solutions through strategic collaboration with a distributed global engineering team


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Managing infrastructure overhead: Our streamlined processes eliminate traditional DevOps burdens so you can focus exclusively on high\-impact development
* Sitting through productivity\-killing meetings: We prioritize your technical output over discussion—expect focused collaboration, not endless conversation
* Writing code the conventional way: If your workflow still begins with manual coding rather than AI\-assisted generation, this position isn't aligned with our approach


**Full Stack Developer Key Responsibilities**
 Accelerate business transformation by implementing AI\-driven features that revolutionize service provider workflows and deliver measurable competitive advantage in the market.
   

  

**Basic Requirements**
* Demonstrated AI\-First Development Mindset: You must approach problems by leveraging AI capabilities first, then enhancing with human expertise—not the reverse
* 4\+ years of production software development experience with server\-side web applications
* Proven track record building mission\-critical B2B software applications that meet enterprise reliability standards
* Deep expertise in cloud\-native development and serverless architectures, specifically within AWS environments
* Advanced proficiency with GenAI code assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor.sh, v0\.dev) in professional development contexts
* Verifiable success implementing Generative AI solutions with quantifiable business impact


**About Trilogy**
 Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer\-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon\-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud\-based stack.

 Als Junior BI Consultant bij Solviteers krijg je de kans om zowel expertise op te bouwen in Business Intelligence als kennis op te doen van de bronapplicaties binnen de overheidssector. Dit biedt een unieke combinatie die snel veel kennis en ervaring oplevert en een sterke positie in de markt mogelijk maakt. De aanwezigheid van ervaren collega’s stimuleert jouw ontwikkeling, net als de complexiteit en uitdagingen tijdens opdrachten. Dagelijks sta je voor complexe puzzels en geniet je van de variatie en uitdaging die de opdrachten bieden, waardoor je voortdurend wordt uitgedaagd en gemotiveerd.
   

  

 Als Junior BI Consultant analyseer je in eerste instantie de informatiebehoefte van de klant en ontwikkel je rapporten en dashboards. Je kunt je specialiseren in het maken van managementinformatie voor diverse bronapplicaties of nieuwe technieken toepassen. Verder kun je je verdiepen in datawarehousing als BI data engineer, een BI\-architectuur ontwikkelen als data architect of voorspellingsmodellen maken als data scientist. Ten slotte kun je een adviserende rol aannemen om klanten te helpen bij het bepalen van hun managementinformatiebehoeften.
   

  

 Er zijn vijf hoofdrollen binnen BI, hoewel titels kunnen variëren. Vaak overlappen deze rollen, wat betekent dat je tijdens een opdracht elementen van meerdere rollen kunt tegenkomen.
   

  

 In de basis vraag je bij de klant de behoefte naar managementinformatie uit en vertaal je deze naar een rapport of dashboard. Als BI Consultant richt je je op het ontwikkelen van het rapport of dashboard met de beschikbare BI\-tool, terwijl je als Data Engineer meer bezig bent met de techniek achter het beschikbaar stellen van de data (en meestal) in de vorm van een datawarehouse.
   

  

**Waar kom je te werken?**
 Bij Solviteers werk je samen met een team van deskundige collega's om complexe IT\-vraagstukken aan te pakken. Jouw bijdrage gaat verder dan waarde leveren aan klanten; het draagt direct bij aan positieve maatschappelijke impact. Binnen Solviteers staat professionele groei centraal, maar ook het plezier in samenwerken. Zo kan je naast goed samenwerken met professionals, ook op vrijwillige basis aansluiten bij leuke uitjes die georganiseerd worden door onze personeelsvereniging.
   

  

 Bij Solviteers zijn we ervan overtuigd dat je kunt blijven groeien. In onze op maat gemaakte ontwikkeltrajecten focus je op zowel persoonlijke\- als professionele groei. Met specifieke ontwikkelpaden voor elke functie, afgestemd op jouw sterke punten en ambities. Wij bieden trajecten aan waarin je werkt aan het versterken van hard skills, soft skills en praktijkervaring. Bij ons staat jouw groei centraal.
   

  

**Wat wij vragen?**
 Om succesvol te zijn in deze rol is het belangrijk dat je analytische vaardigheden bezit en creatief bent in het bedenken van oplossingen. Jouw communicatieve vaardigheden en resultaatgerichtheid zorgen er daarnaast voor je dat je nieuwe concepten snel kunt oppakken, goed met stakeholders kan schakelen en flexibel bent in veranderende omstandigheden.
   

  

**Wat je verder meeneemt**
* Je hebt een hbo\-/wo diploma, bij voorkeur op het gebied van BI of ICT;
* Je hebt ervaring met BI\-tools (Cognos of Power\-BI);
* Je hebt ervaring met SQL (Oracle of SQL\-server);
* Je hebt ervaring met methodieken zoals Scrum en Agile en hebt affiniteit met het inzichtelijk maken van data.


**Wat we nog meer graag zouden zien, maar wat je ook bij ons kunt leren:**
* Je hebt bij voorkeur kennis van datawarehouse concepten en architecturen zoals Stermodelleren, Kimball en/of Data Vault;
* Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring met het ontwikkelen van datawarehouses (Oracle of Azure);
* Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring in de (lokale) overheid.


**Wat wij bieden?**
* Een vast salaris tussen de €3\.300 en €4\.000
* Winstuitkering en pensioenregeling
* Maatwerk ontwikkelprogramma
* 12 ontwikkeldagen en 12 kennisdelingsdagen met collega’s

 Bol is always advancing its platform to create a better tomorrow for over 13 million customers and 49,000 trading partners. Our advertising propositions help shoppers discover products and advertisers reach customers – this is where you’ll make a difference. You’ll use data to help our advertising customers inform decisions, frame conversations, and change perceptions. And you’ll ensure it’s used effectively and responsibly.
   

  

**The biggest challenge**
 Advertising via Bol is growing fast and is becoming an increasingly important channel for our advertising customers. Their need for data and insights are no exception. They rely on us to provide them with meaningful metrics, insightful analyses, and reliable predictive models to keep investing effectively
   

  

**What You’ll Do As a Data Analyst**
 You’ll join 15 analysts in Bol’s advertising analytics organization. Together you share a mission of making people performant through analytics. This role is for the versatile analyst who is equally comfortable working with data as engaging with stakeholders. You’ll work with stakeholders to identify high value use cases for analytics, use SQL, Python, Dbt, and Tableau to then create metrics, do analysis across petabytes of data, make meaningful predictions, to eventually help advertising customers make better decisions. Your work will be input for amongst others client meetings, white papers, webinars, and public industry appearances.

* \- You only want to process data No, if you only want to process data and prefer someone else to handle project and stakeholder management.
* \- If you believe analysts don’t need domain knowledge No, if you don't want to dive into the world of advertising. Curiosity and willingness to learn about our domain and customers are key to your success.
* \+ You’re an analytics professional Yes, if you have 5\+ year experience delighting decision makers with your analytical skills. SQL is a must, Python scripting is a strong plus.
* \+ Obsess over building the right things Yes, if you believe output does not equal outcome and judge success by value creation.
* \+ You get (and create) energy by working with others Yes, if you can translate technical information into language anyone can understand. You enjoy working with both data and people.

 Als BI Consultant bij Solviteers krijg je de kans om zowel expertise op te bouwen in Business Intelligence als kennis op te doen van de bronapplicaties binnen de overheidssector. Dit biedt een unieke combinatie die snel veel kennis en ervaring oplevert en een sterke positie in de markt mogelijk maakt. De aanwezigheid van ervaren collega’s stimuleert jouw ontwikkeling, net als de complexiteit en uitdagingen tijdens opdrachten. Dagelijks sta je voor complexe puzzels en geniet je van de variatie en uitdaging die de opdrachten bieden, waardoor je voortdurend wordt uitgedaagd en gemotiveerd.
 



  





 Als BI Consultant analyseer je in eerste instantie de informatiebehoefte van de klant en ontwikkel je rapporten en dashboards. Je kunt je specialiseren in het maken van managementinformatie voor diverse bronapplicaties of nieuwe technieken toepassen. Verder kun je je verdiepen in datawarehousing als BI data engineer, een BI\-architectuur ontwikkelen als data architect of voorspellingsmodellen maken als data scientist. Ten slotte kun je een adviserende rol aannemen om klanten te helpen bij het bepalen van hun managementinformatiebehoeften.
 



  





*""Iedere dag krijg je te maken met complexe puzzels en veel afwisseling wat voldoende uitdaging biedt.""* 




  





**Wat je gaat doen** 




 Er zijn vijf hoofdrollen binnen BI, hoewel titels kunnen variëren. Vaak overlappen deze rollen, wat betekent dat je tijdens een opdracht elementen van meerdere rollen kunt tegenkomen.
 



  





 In de basis vraag je bij de klant de behoefte naar managementinformatie uit en vertaal je deze naar een rapport of dashboard. Als BI Consultant richt je je op het ontwikkelen van het rapport of dashboard met de beschikbare BI\-tool, terwijl je als Data Engineer meer bezig bent met de techniek achter het beschikbaar stellen van de data (en meestal) in de vorm van een datawarehouse.
 



  





**Jouw verantwoordelijkheden** 



* Je analyseert de informatiebehoefte en data;
* Je ontwikkelt rapporten en dashboards;
* Je ontwikkelt een datawarehouse en bijbehorende ETL\-processen;
* Je vertaalt klantvraagstukken naar passende en toekomstbestendige BI\-architectuur;
* Je komt tot resultaten waarmee de opdrachtgever echt blij is;
* Je adviseert over het gebruik van managementinformatie.



  





**Waar wij voor staan** 




 Bij Solviteers werk je samen met een team van deskundige collega's om complexe IT\-vraagstukken aan te pakken. Jouw bijdrage gaat verder dan waarde leveren aan klanten; het draagt direct bij aan positieve maatschappelijke impact. Binnen Solviteers staat professionele groei centraal, maar ook het plezier in samenwerken. Zo kan je naast goed samenwerken met professionals, ook op vrijwillige basis aansluiten bij leuke uitjes die georganiseerd worden door onze personeelsvereniging.
 



  





**Jouw ontwikkeling** 




 Bij Solviteers krijg je de kans om je breed te ontwikkelen en te ontdekken waar jouw kracht ligt. Hoewel je af en toe opdrachten krijgt die minder specifiek gericht zijn op één van onze stromingen binnen het BI\-team, bieden deze juist de mogelijkheid om een veelzijdige professional te worden. Je kunt je nog steeds richten op specialisatie binnen jouw interessegebied, terwijl je jezelf tegelijkertijd blijft uitdagen met nieuwe, diverse opdrachten die jouw professionele groei stimuleren. In ons ervaren BI\-team bouw je expertise op in verschillende rollen, met de ondersteuning van certificeringen en op maat gemaakte groeipaden. Als consultant ben je meer dan alleen een uitvoerder; jouw inbreng speelt een cruciale rol in de richting die we als team inslaan en in de verdere ontwikkeling van onze dienstverlening.
 



  





**Wat breng je mee?** 




 Om succesvol te zijn in deze rol is het belangrijk dat je analytische vaardigheden bezit en creatief bent in het bedenken van oplossingen. Jouw communicatieve vaardigheden en resultaatgerichtheid zorgen er daarnaast voor je dat je nieuwe concepten snel kunt oppakken, goed met stakeholders kan schakelen en flexibel bent in veranderende omstandigheden.
 



  





**Wat je verder meeneemt:** 




  




* Je hebt een hbo\-/wo diploma, bij voorkeur op het gebied van BI of ICT;
* Je hebt ervaring met BI\-tools (Cognos of Power\-BI);
* Je hebt ervaring met SQL (Oracle of SQL\-server);
* Je hebt ervaring met methodieken zoals Scrum en Agile en hebt affiniteit met het inzichtelijk maken van data.



  





**Wat we nog meer graag zouden zien, maar wat je ook bij ons kunt leren:** 




  




* Je hebt bij voorkeur kennis van datawarehouse concepten en architecturen zoals Stermodelleren, Kimball en/of Data Vault;
* Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring met het ontwikkelen van datawarehouses (Oracle of Azure);
* Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring in de (lokale) overheid.



  





**Wat krijg je van ons?** 



* Een vast salaris tussen de €3\.300 en €5\.500
* Winstuitkering en pensioenregeling
* Maatwerk ontwikkelprogramma
* 12 ontwikkeldagen en 12 kennisdelingsdagen met collega’s
* Eigen opleidingsbudget, waarvan een deel vrije keuze om jouw werk\-/privébalans nog beter te maken (gadgets, sportschool of een comfortabele thuiswerkplek)
* Leaseauto of OV\-kaart
* 27 vakantiedagen o.b.v. fulltime
* Hybride werken



  





**Heb je interesse of vragen?** 




 Ik help jou graag verder, je kunt mij bereiken via mail of telefoon.

 Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and Gaussian Splatting have revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, enabling real\-time, high\-fidelity rendering of a scene from an arbitrary viewpoint, enabling the manipulation of the scene. In our previous work, Neuro NCAP, we used these techniques to create crash test simulators for autonomous vehicles that can simulate actions in closed\-loop by synthesizing novel viewpoints of the ego vehicle. Building on these breakthroughs, this PhD project at TU Delft explores AI\-driven methods to enhance closed\-loop simulation for safety\-critical scenarios. A key focus is developing learned simulators that generate radar and lidar data from camera sensors. Additionally, the research will investigate end\-to\-end prediction and planning approaches that integrate radar\-based perception and are trained in closed\-loop, moving beyond traditional modular robotics pipelines to create more robust and scalable autonomous systems.

 Q42 bouwt digitale producten die het leven van mensen slimmer, beter en leuker maken.
   

  

 Al meer dan 20 jaar helpen we bedrijven als Rijksmuseum, PostNL, HEMA, Avis, AVROTROS en de Efteling met het bedenken en maken van schaalbare producten. Websites, apps, connected devices, AI\-toepassingen en meer. Van idee tot lancering.
   

  

 Tech zit in de kern van alles wat we doen. Onze teams van developers en projectleiders zijn altijd bezig met snel uitproberen, leren en verbeteren. Totdat het product fijn is in gebruik, de business laat groeien én wij er zelf een glimlach van krijgen.
   

  

****Pas jij bij Q42?****
 Ervaring is mooi meegenomen, maar niet het belangrijkste. Jouw technische potentie en de match wegen zwaarder.
   

  

* Zit je in je laatste jaar van een informatica gerelateerde HBO\- of WO\-studie, zoals HBO\-ICT, CMD of Creative Technology en zoek je een plek om een afstudeerstage te doen?
* Experimenteer je 't liefst de hele tijd met nieuwe technologie?
* Hou je van de juiste oplossing bedenken?
* Wil je verschil maken met je werk?
* En leer je graag nieuwe dingen?


 Dan ben jij de stagiair(e) die we zoeken!
   

  

****Past Q42 bij jou?****
 Wil je weten of Q \- zoals we Q42 meestal noemen \- bij jou past? We kunnen je alvast vertellen, wat wij te bieden hebben en waar wij van houden. Dan kun jij inschatten of er voldoende overlap is voor een gesprek.
   

  

* We noemen Q graag een happy place for nerds. We houden dan ook niet zo van kaders. Veel Q'ers doen er iets bij naast het programmeren. Dat houdt Q lekker plat en geeft iedereen de mogelijkheid om mee te sturen én te groeien.
* We houden van techniek. We verdiepen ons graag in dingen als Svelte, Kotlin Multiplatform, .NET en alle nieuwe AI\-tools. Tijdens onze tweewekelijks vrijgeplande dag aka Passietijd leren we het liefst iets nieuws en proberen we dat meteen uit. Maar soms bouwen we ook gewoon even iets geinigs binnen onze comfortzone. Of iets waarvan we vinden dat we dat écht nodig hebben. Zoals een connected glijbaan en connected toiletten.
* Met ruim negentig slimme engineers is er genoeg te leren bij Q. Van Bedenktijdjes en het schrijven voor ons Engineering Blog tot samen leerzame conferenties bezoeken.
* Ons werk is productontwikkeling: het allerbeste product neerzetten om de eindgebruiker te verbazen. Dat doen we met Wie is de Mol?, Efteling, Rijksmuseum, PostNL, gemeente Amsterdam, Philips Hue, HEMA , The National Gallery, Secrid en andere mooie klanten en partners.
* Maar we ontwikkelen ook eígen producten via onze ventures, zoals onze tech for good start\-up Hack The Planet. Die ventures maken ons beter in productdenken, wat we weer kunnen toepassen in onze projecten. En vice versa.
* Techniek is pas interessant met mensen erbij, vinden wij. We testen onze producten dan ook regelmatig met eindgebruikers en maken ons al jaren hard voor accessibility.
* Op onze stekkies in Den Haag en Amsterdam kunnen we fijn in the zone komen én heel goed feesten. Daar houden we sowieso wel van, samen leuke dingen doen: van het jaarlijkse Q\-uitje en onze hackathon tot pubquizzes en bordspelavonden in onze eigen bruine kroeg.
* Wil je nog meer weten, Kom eens langs tijdens een van onze openbare meetups of lees hier ons uitgebreide verhaal!
* Ook relevant: onze arbeidsvoorwaarden. De stagevergoeding bedraagt 600 euro per maand.


****Je ziet voldoende overlap?****
 Laten we dan eens kletsen! Je bent van harte welkom op ons kantoor in Amsterdam of Den Haag. Klik op de button hieronder, dan plannen wij een gesprek in.
   

  

****Stage\-opdrachten****
 (Afstudeer)stages zijn voor Q een manier om onze klanten een cadeautje te geven. Of onszelf natuurlijk. Want stage\-opdrachten leveren vaak nieuwe inzichten en toffe productideeën op.
   

  

 Nu hebben we zelf nog wel een paar voorbeelden van opdrachten. Zie hieronder. Maar we zijn vooral ook retenieuwsgierig naar jouw eigen creativiteit. Dus geef vooral aan als je een véél beter plan hebt waarmee je aan de slag wilt!
   

  

* Een eigen Q\-versie van Github Copilot maken door een open\-source AI\-model te finetunen op code uit onze projecten.
* Image recognition voor het Rijksmuseum.
* Een eigen GPT trainen met open source LLM's om de privacy\- en datazorgen van bedrijven weg te nemen.
* Manieren vinden om de milieu\-impact van een bestaande website of app te evalueren en te verminderen.
* Prepper CMS, Sanity of Q.CMS beter maken voor headless, met als doel om voor een klant een real\-time overzicht van hun inventory te presenteren op een scherm in hun kantoor, bijvoorbeeld door middel van websockets.
* Phoenix is een super scalable batteries included framework met live webview updates dankzij de Elixir programmeertaal. Bij Q doen we tot op heden weinig met deze nieuwe hippe stack. Maar dat kan jij veranderen!


****Onze 'procedure'.****
 ""Een wat? Een procedure?"" Ja, we weten ’t, wij houden er ook niet van. Hebben we gelukkig ook niet zoveel. Maar omdat we stagiair(e)s aannemen best wel heel erg serieus nemen, willen we dit zo goed mogelijk doen. We moeten in dit proces ook kritisch zijn, want we hebben maar ruimte om zo'n vier stagiair(e)s per jaar te begeleiden.
   

  

* Klik op 'Ik wil langskomen!' en maak er een mooi verhaal van.
* We organiseren een kennismakingsgesprek om te kletsen over een stageplek.
* We gaan samen op zoek naar een stage\-opdracht die bij jou en Q42 past. Soms vinden we 'm meteen, soms moeten we er even op broeden.
* We hebben een opdracht dan wel plek gevonden die goed bij je past. Nog een keertje langskomen om te kijken of het klikt bij het team en/of de begeleider waarmee je gaat samenwerken.
* We zetten een krabbel op alle officiële docs, en je komt hier lol en verschil maken.","Technology, Information and Internet",https://nl.linkedin.com/company/q42,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQHizVvJvr3SWw/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1630579658266/q42_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ioB0C8GJxp5ikQCZdBM6lBXSCTXYZv0kj9BbPPSAC_8,,,,,,,,,,,,llm,linkedin,nl

 Bij Cardan zetten we ons dagelijks in voor een inclusieve digitale samenleving waarin iedereen – met of zonder beperking – volwaardig mee kan doen. Dat doen we met een team van betrokken professionals die toegankelijkheid niet alleen als wettelijke verplichting zien, maar vooral als maatschappelijke verantwoordelijkheid.
 



  





 We zijn toegankelijk, betrouwbaar, behulpzaam, innovatief en gepassioneerd. Die waarden zie je terug in onze aanpak én in de technologieën die we ontwikkelen. Zo hebben we onze eigen SaaS\-oplossing ontwikkeld. Deze krachtige tool ondersteunt organisaties bij het structureel verbeteren van digitale toegankelijkheid. Omdat de tool in elke audit enorme hoeveelheden relevante data genereert, vormt het ook een ideale basis voor het toepassen van AI\-oplossingen. Denk aan automatische rapportages, slimme analyses van auditbevindingen of gepersonaliseerde adviezen op basis van wet\- en regelgeving zoals de WCAG.
 



  





 AI is voor ons geen doel op zich, maar een strategisch middel om onze missie kracht bij te zetten: het versnellen van processen, het verhogen van kwaliteit en het vergroten van impact. Door slim gebruik te maken van data en technologie maken we onze dienstverlening niet alleen schaalbaar, maar ook toekomstbestendig.
 



  





 Het bewustzijn rond digitale toegankelijkheid groeit – mede door nieuwe wetgeving – maar dat is nog maar het begin. Daarom groeien we als organisatie hard en willen we onze impact verder vergroten, in Nederland én daarbuiten. Met jou zorgen we ervoor dat digitale producten toegankelijk worden voor iedereen. Zoals Artikel 1 van de Wet gelijke behandeling op grond van handicap of chronische ziekte stelt: “Ieder mens moet in staat worden gesteld aansluitend bij zijn eigen mogelijkheden autonoom te zijn.”
 



  





**Wat ga je doen** 









 De AI Specialist ondersteunt de interne AI\-specialist in het opzetten, testen, implementeren en optimaliseren van AI\-toepassingen binnen Cardan. De rol is gericht op de praktische kant van AI\-integratie: van data ontsluiten tot AI\-modellen toepasbaar maken in onze processen. Zo draagt deze persoon bij aan de duurzame verankering van AI binnen de organisatie.

* Analyseren van complexe datasets en identificeren van relevante patronen

Yes, we’re looking for a Full\-stack web developer. And yes, there are plenty of other opportunities out there. If you’re exploring your options, you might be thinking about growth, creativity, a sense of purpose, or just a healthier work\-life balance. We get it—everyone wants their own version of a “perfect fit.”
 



  




 So here’s why you might consider AIAIAI:
 
  





 We’re an early\-stage startup with significant traction, on track to become cashflow positive this year—so there’s no frantic chasing of funding to stay afloat. Our team is small (currently 8 of us) by design, and we plan to grow to around 15 by the end of the year to ensure profitability. From there, we’ll scale linearly—about 3–5 new hires a month—depending on our sales results.
 



  





 You’ll be working with an experienced development team that’s already built and scaled successful SAAS products. AIAIAI itself was born out of two sister companies, Lifely and Nucleoo, giving you access to a broader network of colleagues and experts in Amsterdam, Granada, and Madrid. We hope you look back in 20 years and say, “That’s where I did some of the most impactful and fulfilling work of my life.”
 



  





 AI—yes, it’s a buzzword filled with smoke and mirrors. That’s not us (or at least, we’re trying not to be). Because no matter how slowly actual adoption might be happening, we’re all being affected by AI in one way or another—teachers feeling the pressure to adapt, office employees expected to deliver more in less time. There’s a huge segment of people, especially once you drive a bit outside big cities, who aren’t “prompting” or tapping into AI to boost productivity. Their jobs—and the relevance of their employers—is at risk. That’s what we address at
 



  





 AIAIAI: helping everyday people use AI in a way that feels natural to them. We meet them where they are, instead of asking them to change. We’ve designed our product so that both employees and companies don’t end up saying “AI AI AI” three years from now because they were blindsided. It’s a product being used daily by users who’d typically fall into the late majority or even “laggards” on the adoption curve. And that’s the mission you’d help drive: making a fast\-changing world a bit more manageable for people who just need it to work.
   




 What can you expect from the role?
 
 As our Full\-stack web developer, you’ll help shape the core architecture of our platform—both front\-end and back\-end. You’ll be part of key decisions on how we build and scale, working alongside product managers, designers, and fellow engineers. You'll also implement AI features into our products, integrating with machine learning models, and crafting intelligent user experiences that leverage the latest AI technologies.
   




 Responsibilities
 
  




* **Full\-Stack Feature Development**



 Develop, test, and maintain features across frontend (Svelte \+ TypeScript) and backend (Golang, Python).
 


* **Architecture \& Tooling**



 Contribute to choices around frameworks, libraries, and infrastructure, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
 


* **API \& Integration**



 Design and document RESTful APIs or gRPC services for robust service integration.
 


* **AI Integration**



 Implement AI/ML capabilities in applications, work with relevant APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), frameworks (Airflow, LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc), and develop user interfaces for AI\-powered features.
 


* **Code Quality \& Deployment**



 Advocate for best practices, implement testing (frontend \& backend), and optimize CI/CD pipelines.
 


* **Collaboration \& Troubleshooting**



 Work closely with cross\-functional team.
   




 Who are you?
 
  





**Technical Experience** 




 3\+ years in full\-stack development with solid JavaScript/TypeScript, front\-end frameworks, and either Golang or Python (preferably both).
 



  





**Cloud \& Containerization** 




 Familiarity with Docker, Kubernetes, and IaC tools like Terraform (we primarily use Azure, but any cloud background helps).
 



  





**Database Proficiency** 




 Comfortable with both SQL and NoSQL.
 



  





**AI/ML Knowledge** 




 Experience integrating LLMs and AI tools into data workflows and applications, including ETL/ELT pipelines using frameworks like Airflow, PyTorch, and LangChain.
 



  





**Git \& CI/CD** 




 Experience setting up and maintaining pipelines (GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.).
 



  





**Analytical Mindset \& Communication** 




 Strong problem\-solving skills and the ability to explain technical concepts to non\-technical stakeholders.
 



  





**Passion for AI Innovation** 




 Have a genuine affinity for AI and keep tabs on high\-level developments in the field.
 



 Don’t let a partial skills match hold you back – if you have experience in most areas and can learn the rest on the job, we want to see your application. We believe in learning through doing and value candidates who can grow with us.
   




 What do we offer?
 
  





**Impact \& Growth** 




 Help shape how we onboard and retain clients at a crucial stage in AIAIAI’s growth. Your success will directly influence our speed of scaling—and your own career trajectory.
 



  





**Location \& Flexibility** 




 Our office sits on the canals of Amsterdam, a hub of creativity and culture. As a rule of thumb, we believe it’s beneficial to be in the office between 2 and 3 days per week, but we’re not going to be a stickler about it.
 



  





**A Stable Early\-Stage Environment** 




 We’re on track to become cashflow positive, so you’re joining a startup with real traction (and less existential risk).
 



  





**Room to Innovate** 




 We encourage you to bring your best ideas to the table within your contractual hours—minimal hustle\-culture overdrive.
 



  





**Collaboration \& Community** 




 While we’re a tight\-knit group of 8, we’re also connected to the larger networks of Lifely and Nucleoo of 120\+ employees, offering broader collaboration opportunities.
 



  





**Competitive Compensation** 




 We offer a salary and benefits package aligned with your experience, with a target range between €65,000 and €80,000 (all\-in). Since we don’t have a direct benchmark for this role, we’ll collaborate with you to ensure the offer is fair and competitive based on your expectations.
 



  





**No sponsorship** 




 Unfortunately we are not able to provide sponsorship right now. Therefore you have to be an EU, EEA or a Swiss national to be able to apply for this job.
   




 How to Apply
 
  





 Send us your resume, portfolio links (GitHub, etc.), and a short note on why you’re a great fit.

The Authority Authorised to Conclude Contracts of Employment (AACC) sets up a Selection Committee, composed of at least three members, consisting of one chair and at least one member from the administration and one member designated by the Staff Committee.  

For **restricted posts (including restricted \- Annex II posts)**, the AACC designates up to two additional members of the Selection Committee if so requested by the Chairperson of the Management Board. The additional members shall consist of a representative of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union or one representative of the Presidency and one representative of another Member State.
The selection criteria, set out in this Vacancy Notice, will be assessed by the Selection Committee throughout the different stages of the selection procedure. Before the start of the selection procedure, the Selection Committee will decide which selection criteria will be used at each stage of the selection procedure. Certain selection criteria will be assessed only for shortlisted candidates during a written test and/or a competency\-based interview.  


The Selection Committee will assess the applications received in order to make an initial selection of those candidates meeting all eligibility criteria and matching best the selection criteria (suitability).  

In case of candidates shortlisted for **restricted** posts **(including restricted \- Annex II posts)**, who had indicated membership of a competent authority in one of the Member States, Europol will seek confirmation from the relevant Europol National Unit to ensure that those candidates indeed belong to a competent authority.  

The minimum pass\-mark for being shortlisted, i.e. invited to participate in a post\-related selection procedure, consisting of a written test and a competency\-based interview, is established as 60% of the total maximum score.  

The Selection Committee will shortlist the **12** highest scoring candidates. All candidates having a score equal to the **12th** highest scoring candidate will be invited to take part in the first stage of the selection procedure (written test). At shortlisting stage, the Selection Committee will also establish the pass\-mark for the selection procedure. It is intended for the written test to be conducted onsite.  

The Selection Committee will assess the written test against the selection criteria. Those candidates who do not reach the pass\-mark for the test will be informed that they do not qualify to participate in the interview. All candidates who reach the pass\-mark for the test will be invited to the second stage of the selection procedure (interview).
It is intended for the written test to be conducted on\-site at Europol, and the interviews remotely. Should the Selection Committee consider it necessary to make changes how the selection procedure is conducted, either in part or in full, in the interest of the proceedings, the candidates invited to participate in the selection procedure will be informed accordingly.  


After the selection procedure has taken place, the Selection Committee will establish a list of successful candidates, i.e. those scoring above the pre\-defined pass\-mark, which is shared with the AACC, for establishment of a Reserve list. A Reserve list is valid for 24 months. Candidates who participated in the interview will be informed of the outcome, i.e. whether they have been successful or not.

Are you an aspiring researcher passionate about software engineering with a strong interest in real\-world industrial applications? Are you interested in ground\-breaking research on security vulnerabilities and explainable AI that will help software engineers identify, fix and understand software bugs more efficiently? If so, you have a key role to play as a PhD candidate in the Find2Fix project!
  
  

Software errors and vulnerabilities, or bugs, consume significant time and resources from software engineers. Several solutions have been implemented, from memory\-safe programming languages to coding assistants designed to help developers write safer, more efficient and maintainable code. Despite this, developers continue to develop buggy code, often without fully understanding the root causes or how to effectively fix them.
  
  

**In the Find2Fix:** Reducing Software Errors using Transparent AI project, we engineer the first open\-source tool for the entire process from software error discovery to mitigation based on security testing and model inference (PhD1\) and explainable AI (PhD2\) technology. Your main responsibilities as a PhD candidate will be to conduct cutting\-edge research within the Find2Fix project. Your research will be published and presented at international AI, software engineering and security venues.
  
  

The first position, supervised by Erik Poll and Harald Vranken, explores the combination of security testing, such as fuzzing or other techniques for static (SAST) and dynamic (DAST) analysis, with model inference using Sicco Verwer's FlexFringe tool. This tool maps execution traces to automata that model software behaviour, which can then be used to analyse security flaws.
  
  

The second position, supervised by Mairieli Wessel and Frits Vaandrager, focuses on explaining the root cause of already identified bugs and why a suggested fix works, tailoring explanations to the varying contexts and needs of software engineers. You will research and apply explainable AI techniques, engaging with software engineers via case studies, interviews and other empirical methods to better understand their perspectives, and refine and evaluate the quality of the explanations.
  
  

As a PhD candidate, you will be part of a dynamic and collaborative research group. The Find2Fix project is a joint initiative involving two industrial partners \- ASML and dCodis (a startup). Alongside the rest of the team, you will contribute to developing demonstrators for the Find2Fix technology at our industrial partners. This project fosters a close collaboration between Radboud University and TU Delft, where two additional PhD students will also work on Find2Fix under the supervision of Dr Sicco Verwer, Dr Annibale Panichella, and Dr Sebastijan Dumančić.
  
  

Your teaching load will be up to 10% of your working time.

Do you want to contribute to the bottom\-up construction of synthetic cells? Are you excited about the application of AI tools to predict gene expression levels across a synthetic genome? Then join our team as a PhD Candidate!
  
  

Future synthetic cells will require an optimised gene expression system, capable of reliable, well\-controlled expression of hundreds of genes on a synthetic genome. However, we cannot predict how much and how fast proteins are produced in vitro, as we need to learn the so\-called cis\-regulatory code: the relationship between DNA sequence and protein levels.
  
  

The ambition of this project is to train an AI model that predicts the cis\-regulatory code for synthetic genomes (i.e. for cell\-free gene expression systems) and correlates the experimental conditions within the synthetic cell (crowding, concentration of nutrients, size of liposome, etc.) with gene expression levels across a synthetic genome.
  
  

To achieve this aim, you will use VASA\-seq and Ribo\-Seq to generate large data sets that can be used for training machine learning and deep learning models. You will work in tight collaboration with other researchers in Nijmegen, Delft and at the Hubrecht Institute (van Oudenaarden group).

ICT
### **Niveau:**


HBO BACHELOR
**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Als delivery manager zorg je dat diensten volgens de vastgestelde beheer\- en acceptatiecriteria ontwikkeld én geleverd worden. Je staat met je ene been in de technologie en met het andere in de organisatie. Je zorgt dat risico’s voor de business beheersbaar blijven en geld slim wordt besteed, maar luistert ook naar de wens om te innoveren. Dit vraagt om het nodige balanceerwerk. Je gaat in gesprek met de (DevOps)teams die de diensten leveren en onderhouden en verleent service aan de gebruikers van onze Microsoft diensten.


Een beter moment dan nu kun je niet kiezen om in te stappen. Op dit moment zijn we druk met de ontwikkeling van (publieke) cloud oplossingen, het automatiseren van onze dienstverlening en een Agile transitie van onze organisatie. De volgende stappen in de uitbreiding van onze Microsoft dienstverlening in voorbereiding op een volledig hybride en geautomatiseerde cloud toekomst.


Kortom: in deze veelzijdige functie zit je boven op de innovaties en bouw je mee aan de politieorganisatie van de toekomst.


**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


Je gaat aan de slag voor de productlijn Microsoft Server in Driebergen of Rotterdam. De productlijn bestaat momenteel uit 7 deelteams met gedreven engineers, solution architecten en infrastructuur ontwikkelaars. We werken zeer zelfstandig en weten onze diverse expertises goed te verenigen in de multidisciplinaire teams.


Er heerst een dynamische sfeer op de afdeling waarbij er veelvuldig over de teams heen wordt samengewerkt. We staan voor een hoge mate van innovatie en hebben als doel de leading technology van vandaag in te bedden als de proven technology van morgen. Als delivery manager zoek je regelmatig de samenwerking op met andere teams binnen de politie en ben je betrokken bij thema’s die de hele dienst aangaan, zoals veiligheid. Als bedrijf maken we een transitie door naar een Agile gedachtengoed en DevOps invulling van werkzaamheden waar dat passend is. Als delivery manager krijg je met deze transitie te maken en kun je de organisatie helpen hier invulling aan te geven.


**Wie ben jij?**
----------------


Jij kunt prima balanceren tussen de organisatie en technologie. Jouw sociale vaardigheden komen hierbij goed van pas. Continu verbeteren, snel schakelen en doorpakken gaan je goed af. Wat dat betreft voel je je thuis in een dynamische en innovatieve werkomgeving. Je kunt goed afwegen en beoordelen of producten en diensten voldoen aan de gemaakte afspraken en verwachtingen. Je gaat inhoudelijke discussies aan, kun je goed luisteren én helder presenteren. Dankzij jouw nieuwsgierigheid en leergierige houding leer je de organisatie vlot kennen, zodat je weet welke producten en diensten een meerwaarde zijn voor de politieorganisatie.


*Verder heb je:*


* hbo werk\- en denkniveau\*;
* ruime ervaring met ITSM processen en frameworks, zoals ITIL;
* kennis van open source en cloud technologie;
* Ervaring met de Agile (Scrum en DevOps) werkwijze.

Verder kun je het volgende van ons verwachten:


* een bruto maandsalaris van minimaal €3\.554,\- en maximaal €5\.598,\- (schaal 10 Bbp) op basis van een 36\-urige werkweek;
* een Individueel Keuzebudget (IKB) dat uit twee delen bestaat:
	+ Een bruto deel van 17,86% van je salaris. Met dit budget kun je een deel van je arbeidsvoorwaarden zelf samenstellen. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan het uitbetalen van je budget, het kopen van vakantie\-uren of ontwikkelactiviteiten zoals een opleiding.
	+ Een netto deel van € 377 per jaar. Dit budget kun je bijvoorbeeld gebruiken voor duurzaamheidsdoelen, vakbondscontributie en voor vitaliteit.
* goede pensioenregeling en betaald ouderschapsverlof (meer info over verlof, regelingen en mogelijkheden).

Samen met collega\-experts werk je aan geavanceerde technologieën zoals Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) en Deep Learning (DL). Dagelijks werkt het feature team aan Inpact.AI, om verzekeringsprofessionals te helpen om snel en effectief grote hoeveelheden data te verwerken, waaronder polissen, claims, rapporten, e\-mails, PDF’s, afbeeldingen en andere vormen van digitale informatie.

Bij Inpact helpen we verzekeraars innoveren, zodat zij tijd en focus overhouden voor het échte werk. Als AI/ML Engineer bouw je mee aan de toekomst van verzekeren. Zonder poespas, mét resultaat. Ja, we zijn ambitieus. Maar hier geen overmatig werken of competitie over functietitels. Grote ego's laten we buiten, grootse plannen verwelkomen we met open armen.

Ons team bestaat uit een hechte club van 100 nuchtere collega's (waarvan zeker 70 tech\-specialisten) met een passie voor technologie, AI en Data Science. We doen niet aan gedoe, we doen vooral heel normaal terwijl we complexe data omzetten naar waardevolle inzichten voor verzekeraars.

**Zo bouw jij mee aan de toekomst van verzekeren**

We hebben het al genoemd: wij zoeken mensen die gewoon goed werk doen. Geen poespas, wél baanbrekend werk. Geen opschepperij, wél trots op wat we samen bereiken. En als AI/ML Engineer verwachten we dat je:

* Een relevante wo\-opleiding hebt in Data Science, Informatica, Wiskunde, Kunstmatige Intelligentie of Econometrie.
* Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring hebt met frameworks en tools voor machine learning en deep learning, zoals PyTorch en Sklearn.
* Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring hebt met Large Language Models(LLM), waaronder fine\-tuning, prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\-systemen.
* Ervaring met het ontwikkelen en implementeren van machine learning\-oplossingen met grootschalige datasets, inclusief specificatieontwerp, dataverzameling en \-labeling, modelontwikkeling, validatie, implementatie en voortdurende monitoring.
* Ervaring hebt met Python, C\# of Java en source control (Git).
* Een pré als je ervaring hebt met cloudplatforms (bijv. AWS, Azure, GCP).
* Ervaring met data engineering pipelines.
* Proactief, analytisch en samenwerkingsgericht bent.

**Dit vinden wij de normaalste zaak van de wereld**

In één jaar van 10 naar 100 klanten groeien? Dat vinden wij niet gek. Een starter die binnen no\-time haar eigen team aanstuurt? Kan gewoon. En de koffie? Gewoon een kop normale koffie, ténzij je het anders wilt natuurlijk. Wat we nog meer normaal vinden?

* Een competitief salaris
* Prima pensioenregeling waarmee je oude dag gewoon goed geregeld is
* Nieuwe hardware zoals een Lenovo laptop, BOSE headset en veel AI tools
* Gewoon vanuit huis kunnen werken, met een onbelaste thuiswerkvergoeding van €2,35 per dag

Bij Van Ommen bouwden we een AI\-chatbot die klanten sneller naar het juiste product leidt én de klantenservice ontlast. Voor Simon Loos ontwikkelden we een oplossing die ritdata slim clustert – met directe kostenbesparing als resultaat. En bij PostNL zorgen onze modellen ervoor dat klantmails automatisch én klantvriendelijk worden afgehandeld.

Als Machine Learning Engineer bij Incentro werk je aan dit soort betekenisvolle oplossingen én aan innovatieve projecten zoals agentic AI oplossingen. Je krijgt het vertrouwen om je eigen keuzes te maken en jouw expertise zichtbaar in te zetten. Alles draait hier om autonomie, groei en echte samenwerking. Geen opgelegd pad, maar vrijheid in hoe je je werk doet.

**Wat je gaat doen**  
Samen met een betrokken team van data experts werk jij aan AI\-oplossingen die ertoe doen. Projecten waarin je vakmanschap zichtbaar wordt, en waarin jouw bijdrage het verschil maakt.

Wat je concreet doet:

* je ontwikkelt en traint machine learning\-modellen in Python, met behulp van TensorFlow, PyTorch en scikit\-learn, waarbij je nauwkeurig werkt aan prestaties, explainability en betrouwbaarheid
* je analyseert complexe datasets met Pandas en Numpy, en ontdekt patronen die leiden tot verrassende inzichten voor klanten
* je zorgt dat alles naar productie gaat via CI/CD, versiebeheer in Git, en containerisatie met Docker – jij houdt grip op kwaliteit
* je bouwt en integreert modellen in de cloud (denk aan Vertex AI, SageMaker, of Azure ML) en denkt actief mee over schaalbaarheid en betrouwbaarheid
* je past Generative AI toe via API’s van bijv. OpenAI of Anthropic, en weet hoe je met vector search en RAG slimme, persoonlijke oplossingen bouwt.
* Je experimenteert met agentic AI\-frameworks zoals LangChain, waarmee je systemen bouwt die zelfstandig kunnen redeneren en uitvoeren

**De impact die je maakt**  
Jouw werk heeft direct effect. Niet alleen op systemen, maar ook op mensen. Je helpt organisaties slimmer, sneller of klantgerichter te werken. En dat voel je – in de waardering van de klant, de erkenning van je team en de trots op je werk.

Voorbeelden?

* **Bij Van Ommen** ontwikkelen we een GenAI\-chatbot die klanten écht helpt zoeken. Het beoogde resultaat? Hogere conversie, minder vragen aan support en een soepelere klantreis.
* **Bij PostNL** automatiseerden we de afhandeling van klantmails met ML. Dat bespaart tijd, verhoogt de kwaliteit van reacties én maakt medewerkers blijer.
* **Bij Simon Loos** brachten we structuur aan in ritdata via clustering. Daardoor weten ze nu precies wat er gefactureerd moet worden – met directe besparingen als gevolg.
* **Voor PostNL marketing** bouwden we een model voor klantsegmentatie. Zo zetten ze campagnes gerichter in, met meer resultaat en minder verspilling.

**Wie ben jij?**  
Jij bent iemand die wil groeien in je vak én iets betekenen met je werk. Je zoekt een plek waar jouw ideeën welkom zijn, waar je autonomie krijgt en waar je wordt uitgedaagd om verder te denken dan het model alleen.

Wat jij meebrengt:

* Minimaal 3 jaar ervaring met Python en cloudplatforms als GCP, AWS of Azure
* Kennis van ML\-libraries zoals TensorFlow, PyTorch en sklearn
* Vertrouwd met Docker, Git, CI/CD en het bouwen van ETL\-pipelines
* Interesse in (of ervaring met) Generative AI, RAGs, LLM’s en vector search
* Je communiceert helder – in het Nederlands én in het Engels

Daarnaast herken je je in onze CBAM\-waarden:

* **Camaraderie** – We zijn meer dan collega’s: we inspireren, ondersteunen en vieren successen samen.
* **Boldness** – We durven te experimenteren én kritisch mee te denken voor echte impact.
* **Autonomy** – Jij krijgt het vertrouwen en de ruimte om je werk zelf vorm te geven.
* **Mastery** – We blijven leren en groeien, met een persoonlijk ontwikkelpad en volop kennisdeling.

*Twijfel je of je helemaal past? We leren je graag kennen – ook als je niet aan elk vinkje voldoet.*

**We bieden jou** 

* een vast contract bij de start
* de mogelijkheid om 32u tot 40u per week te werken
* een salaris tussen de €4\.000,\- \& €5\.500,\- \+ 8% vakantiegeld

Bij Van Ommen bouwden we een AI\-chatbot die klanten sneller naar het juiste product leidt én de klantenservice ontlast. Voor Simon Loos ontwikkelden we een oplossing die ritdata slim clustert – met directe kostenbesparing als resultaat. En bij PostNL zorgen onze modellen ervoor dat klantmails automatisch én klantvriendelijk worden afgehandeld.  

  

Als Machine Learning Engineer bij Incentro werk je aan dit soort betekenisvolle oplossingen én aan innovatieve projecten zoals agentic AI oplossingen. Je krijgt het vertrouwen om je eigen keuzes te maken en jouw expertise zichtbaar in te zetten. Alles draait hier om autonomie, groei en echte samenwerking. Geen opgelegd pad, maar vrijheid in hoe je je werk doet.

 **Wat je gaat doen**  

Samen met een betrokken team van data experts werk jij aan AI\-oplossingen die ertoe doen. Projecten waarin je vakmanschap zichtbaar wordt, en waarin jouw bijdrage het verschil maakt.  

  

Wat je concreet doet:


* je ontwikkelt en traint machine learning\-modellen in Python, met behulp van TensorFlow, PyTorch en scikit\-learn, waarbij je nauwkeurig werkt aan prestaties, explainability en betrouwbaarheid
* je analyseert complexe datasets met Pandas en Numpy, en ontdekt patronen die leiden tot verrassende inzichten voor klanten
* je zorgt dat alles naar productie gaat via CI/CD, versiebeheer in Git, en containerisatie met Docker – jij houdt grip op kwaliteit
* je bouwt en integreert modellen in de cloud (denk aan Vertex AI, SageMaker, of Azure ML) en denkt actief mee over schaalbaarheid en betrouwbaarheid
* je past Generative AI toe via API’s van bijv. OpenAI of Anthropic, en weet hoe je met vector search en RAG slimme, persoonlijke oplossingen bouwt.
* Je experimenteert met agentic AI\-frameworks zoals LangChain, waarmee je systemen bouwt die zelfstandig kunnen redeneren en uitvoeren

  

**De impact die je maakt**  

Jouw werk heeft direct effect. Niet alleen op systemen, maar ook op mensen. Je helpt organisaties slimmer, sneller of klantgerichter te werken. En dat voel je – in de waardering van de klant, de erkenning van je team en de trots op je werk.



Voorbeelden?


* **Bij Van Ommen** ontwikkelen we een GenAI\-chatbot die klanten écht helpt zoeken. Het beoogde resultaat? Hogere conversie, minder vragen aan support en een soepelere klantreis.
* **Bij PostNL** automatiseerden we de afhandeling van klantmails met ML. Dat bespaart tijd, verhoogt de kwaliteit van reacties én maakt medewerkers blijer.
* **Bij Simon Loos** brachten we structuur aan in ritdata via clustering. Daardoor weten ze nu precies wat er gefactureerd moet worden – met directe besparingen als gevolg.
* **Voor PostNL marketing** bouwden we een model voor klantsegmentatie. Zo zetten ze campagnes gerichter in, met meer resultaat en minder verspilling.

  

**Wie ben jij?**  

Jij bent iemand die wil groeien in je vak én iets betekenen met je werk. Je zoekt een plek waar jouw ideeën welkom zijn, waar je autonomie krijgt en waar je wordt uitgedaagd om verder te denken dan het model alleen.



Wat jij meebrengt:


* Minimaal 3 jaar ervaring met Python en cloudplatforms als GCP, AWS of Azure
* Kennis van ML\-libraries zoals TensorFlow, PyTorch en sklearn
* Vertrouwd met Docker, Git, CI/CD en het bouwen van ETL\-pipelines
* Interesse in (of ervaring met) Generative AI, RAGs, LLM’s en vector search
* Je communiceert helder – in het Nederlands én in het Engels



Daarnaast herken je je in onze CBAM\-waarden:


* **Camaraderie** – We zijn meer dan collega’s: we inspireren, ondersteunen en vieren successen samen.
* **Boldness** – We durven te experimenteren én kritisch mee te denken voor echte impact.
* **Autonomy** – Jij krijgt het vertrouwen en de ruimte om je werk zelf vorm te geven.
* **Mastery** – We blijven leren en groeien, met een persoonlijk ontwikkelpad en volop kennisdeling.


*Twijfel je of je helemaal past? We leren je graag kennen – ook als je niet aan elk vinkje voldoet.*

* een vast contract bij de start
* de mogelijkheid om 32u tot 40u per week te werken
* een salaris tussen de €4\.000,\- \& €5\.500,\- \+ 8% vakantiegeld

As part of the ongoing NOLAI initiative, we are looking for a motivated PhD candidate to work on content\-generating algorithms for AI in education. Nearly all so\-called ’generative’ AI is not suitable for this task. There are many reasons for this, including pedagogical and didactical ones. At the same time, there is a clear need in education for some kinds of content to be generated. This is where you come in.
  
  

NOLAI funds co\-creation projects that are driven bottom up, starting with the actual needs of stakeholders in Dutch primary and secondary education. In this context, typical ’generative’ AI is viewed critically. When used by pupils to complete tasks, it interferes with the learning objectives of the processes involved. Whereas when used to give feedback, the unavoidable inaccuracies interfere with the quality of the feedback. At the same time, the notion of being able to generate content is attractive in education – this could be, for example, novel materials that teachers could use in class or novel ways of supporting learning. NOLAI co\-creation projects identify such needs. However, there are not always existing methods to fulfil them. At the same time it also remains unclear what kind of methods would be acceptable in education and what kind would not.
  
  

You will therefore carry out research on the responsible use of content\-generating algorithms in education. You will need to interact with existing and upcoming co\-creation projects as well as teachers at various schools in the Netherlands to develop a good understanding and taxonomy of the actual need for such technology. You will also develop novel algorithms, in particular for content generation, based on these needs. Finally, you will not only critically assess the opportunities such technologies offer but also their fundamental limitations; for example, you will investigate how to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised and pedagogical and didactical goals continue to be met.
  
  

Overall, this project will therefore develop a framework to guide deployment of content\-generating algorithms in education as well as algorithms and applications that adhere to this framework and can be deployed in NOLAI co\-creation projects. You will create algorithms whose generated content addresses the specific real\-world needs of stakeholders in education.

Therapeuten die graag hands\-on met patiënten werken, worden door wetgeving en verzekeraars gedwongen om veel formulieren en vragenlijsten in te vullen ter verantwoording van de uitgevoerde behandelingen. Deze verantwoording is noodzakelijk, maar toch vooral frustrerend voor de behandelaar. Dit proces moet beter kunnen met behulp van text\-to\-speech en generative AI.

**De opdracht**
---------------


In deze opdracht ga je samen met fysiotherapeuten een Proof of Concept (PoC) bouwen om de administratieve last te verlichten. Je zorgt ervoor dat gesprekken met de patiënt zoveel mogelijk worden samengevat in ingevulde vragenlijsten, wat de behandelaar veel tijd moet besparen. In de onderzoeksfase ontwerp je een proces waarin de integriteit van de ingevulde vragenlijsten gewaarborgd blijft. Vervolgens ontwikkel je een softwareoplossing die, met behulp van generative AI, de administratie uitvoert. In de implementatiefase bouw en evalueer je deze oplossing samen met professionals in het veld.

-----------------


Do you want to contribute and collaborate to shape the future of human\-centric computing models and applications with an eye on society? Then keep reading, this fully funded PhD position at Vrije Universiteit (VU)Amsterdam may be for you!


Human\-centric AI aims to steer the development and application of AI towards personal and social good while minimizing harm. It builds on the capabilities of generative AI and foundation model techniques and enhances their ability to be collaborative, adaptive, responsible, and explainable (abbreviated as CARE principles). Human\-centric AI can enable effective human\-AI teaming, leading to hybrid systems that yield more than the sum of their parts. However, as an emerging discipline, human\-centric AI and its principles have resulted in a wide range of proposed systems, leading to a poorly understood landscape of requirements, benefits, and limitations. It remains challenging to design effective human\-centric AI systems, i.e., systems that reliably achieve the CARE principles without substantially harming other important quality attributes (QAs) like maintainability or energy consumption. As a solution, the synthesis and curation of software architecture techniques like design decisions, architectural tactics, patterns, or reference architectures can enable practitioners to design human\-centric systems, while supporting the reasoning about trade\-offs between various quality attributes, e.g., explainability, maintainability, or energy consumption.


The Learning and Reasoning and the Software and Sustainability groups are looking for a joint PhD student in **software architecture for human\-centric AI**. The project will survey the emerging landscape of systems in human\-centric AI, investigate how to systematically organize them into modular building blocks, and from there into reusable software architecture techniques. The project will investigate how the various design decisions influence the CARE principles, as well as other QAs like maintainability, evolvability, or performance efficiency. Taking a system perspective that is shaped by quality attribute trade\-offs, the PhD student will synthesize and evaluate software architecture design techniques to support practitioners building such systems. To bridge the gap between these two fields, the PhD student will be supported by one supervisor with extensive human\-centric AI expertise (Dr. Filip Ilievski) and one supervisor with extensive software architecture expertise (Dr. Justus Bogner).

==============================================================================================

#### **Job description**


Motion systems are used throughout the semiconductor and high\-tech industry for fast and extremely precise positioning in e.g. microscopes and chip production process. Motion system design unites structural mechanics and dynamics, electromagnetic actuation, sensing and control. To achieve optimal performance of these mechatronic systems, the AIDEAL project aims to develop a holistic AI\-based design framework capable of considering all these aspects in an integrated manner. A key part of this is the mechanical integration, i.e. the design of the structure that holds everything together and provides the necessary structural stiffness and dynamic behavior. With the availability of additive manufacturing, tremendous design freedom has been unlocked, which allows for radically new high\-performance structural designs. Additionally, advancements in computer vision and language modeling allow for designs from different domains and scales to transform the creativity of AI\-driven generative design models. The endless possibilities and high complexity of the design task exceed the capabilities of experienced human designers. For this reason, we have already successfully developed specific computational design methods based on topology optimization to generate superior mechanical designs. This project aims to develop a new generation of these computational design tools by enhancing them with AI concepts, with the aim to accelerate the design process even further and increase the diversity and optimality of the obtained designs. This PhD project will closely interact with two other PhD researchers that focus on the electromagnetic actuation system and the control design, as well as with a consortium of high tech companies supporting the AIDEAL project. The project plan includes the joint realization of full\-scale functional hardware demonstrator, for which this PhD project is responsible for the mechanical design methodology.

  


The intended starting date of this PhD position is October 1st, 2025\.

* Je draagt bij in de verdere ontwikkeling van onze (data) onderzoeks omgeving, nieuwe tooling, GenAI en data capabilities van onze FEC analisten;
* Je wacht niet af, maar je zoekt mee naar meer nuttige databronnen zowel binnen als buiten de bank, die bij kunnen dragen aan verbetering van de rule\-based modellen. Je stemt dit af met de FEC Investigations analisten om tot de juiste keuzes te komen.
* Samen met domeinexperts op het gebied van betalen, financiële producten, witwassen en terrorisme financiering ga je op zoek naar nieuwe criminele modus operandi die mogelijk nog verborgen is in de data.
* Je werkt samen met andere data\-experts binnen de bank om nuttige combinaties van data te vinden, de juiste context te snappen en om goed te begrijpen hoe de data kan worden gebruikt.
* De datakwaliteit bewaak je en houdt dataleveranciers hierop scherp.
* Je ondersteunt de analisten bij het visualiseren van data voor beter inzicht en rapportage naar het management in rapporten en dashboards.
* Wanneer en dataverzoek bij een ander tem wordt neergelegd, werk je samen met de analist om tot de juiste vraagstelling te komen en om de opgeleverde dataset te beoordelen.

**Feiten \& Cijfers**

* Het betreft een functie voor 32\-36 uur per week;
* Bij FEC Investigations heb je ongeveer 90 collega's;
* Je werkt hybride: je bent gemiddeld 1 dag per week aanwezig op kantoor Croeselaan Utrecht en verder werk je vanuit huis of een ander Rabobankkantoor.

**Jij \& Jouw talent**

*Een salaris in schaal 9 of 10 kan van toepassing zijn voor deze rol, dit is afhankelijk van jouw ervaring in vergelijking met de andere collega’s die in dezelfde schaal werken en wordt nader bepaald op basis van de interviews.*


Dat klant\- en resultaatgerichtheid, communicatiekracht, flexibiliteit, pro\-activiteit, innovatiekracht, zelfstandigheid en overtuigingskracht onmisbaar zijn voor de functie van (Senior) Analyst Thematic Investigations is logisch.

Tevens bieden we hoogwaardige diensten en oplossingen op het gebied van hybride cloud, MSP\-services en cloud\-native technologieën.

  

Om onze groei verder te versterken, zoeken wij een ervaren dealmaker / bidmanager met minimaal 8 jaar ervaring in IT\-sales. Dus ben jij op zoek naar een rol waar je écht impact kan maken? Solliciteer dan snel.

  



**Jouw rol als dealmaker / bidmanager bij ITQ:**


Als dealmaker \& bidmanager ben je verantwoordelijk voor het coördineren en beheren van het gehele bid\-proces, vanaf het moment dat we verwachten dat de RfP komt, tot en met het indienen van de definitieve offerte en daarna, bij voorlopige gunning, voor de onderhandelingen en contractering. Waarbij hij gedurende de bid fase\* ook verantwoordelijk is voor het bepalen, samen met het team, van de winstrategie.


Deze functie vereist een combinatie van projectmanagement\-vaardigheden, strategisch en analytisch denken, uitstekende communicatievaardigheden waarbij het ook belangrijk is dat de bidmanager zijn regie\- en coördinerende rol durft te pakken.


De toekomstige bidmanager dient niet alleen bids te begeleiden, deze dient tevens te kijken hoe ITQ slimmer en steeds efficiënter offertes kunnen gaan schrijven.


Je werkt nauw samen met collega’s zoals Solution Sales, Pre\-Sales Consultants, Service Delivery Managers en Solution Architects om op maat gemaakte oplossingen te bieden die waarde toevoegen voor onze klanten.

 **Wat je gaat doen:**


Een Dealmaker/Bidmanager speelt een sleutelrol in het binnenhalen van strategische deals en aanbestedingen. Hij of zij maakt, samen met het bidteam, een dealkwalificatie, analyseert klantbehoeften, coördineert interne teams en stelt concurrerende offertes en voorstellen op en is verantwoordelijk voor een kloppende businesscase inclusief risico log. De focus ligt op het ontwikkelen van een winnende strategie, onderhandelen over contractvoorwaarden en het bewaken van deadlines. Een dealmaker richt zich meer op de commerciële en strategische aspecten van een deal, terwijl een bidmanager zorgt voor een gestructureerd en compliant bidproces. Samenwerken met interne\- en externe stakeholders is essentieel om een sterke waarde propositie neer te zetten en gedragenheid te verkrijgen. De bidmanager beheert het volledige tenderproces en zorgt ervoor dat alle technische, juridische en financiële aspecten kloppen. De dealmaker stuurt het onderhandelingsproces en zorgt dat de deal wordt gesloten onder optimale voorwaarden voor beide partijen.

 **Jouw profiel**


Je hebt bij voorkeur meer dan 8 jaar ervaring in deze rol. Het is een pre als je die ervaring hebt opgedaan binnen de IT dus dat je begrijpt hoe IT\-oplossingen waarde toevoegen voor klanten en dat weet te positioneren. Het is ook nadrukkelijk een pre als ervaring hebt in 'legal'.

 **Wat we verder van jou vragen:**

*✔ Projectmanagement \& bidcoördinatie – Beheer van complexe bidtrajecten met strakke deadlines en meerdere stakeholders waarbij je het vermogen hebt om onder druk te werken en deadlines te halen*

*✔ Goede communicatieve vaardigheden – Zowel schriftelijk als mondeling overtuigend richting klanten en interne teams*

*✔* Teamgericht en in staat om effectief samen te werken met verschillende afdelingen

*✔ Kennis van Managed Werkplek \& Cloud\-oplossingen – Inzicht in Microsoft 365, Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD), Intune, endpoint security, DaaS (Desktop\-as\-a\-Service) en ITSM\-frameworks (ITIL, COBIT).*

In deze opdracht duik je in het meten en visualiseren van energieverbruik binnen Kubernetes\-clusters.

**Interessegebieden:** Cloud, Kubernetes, energie, green software, duurzaamheid, open\-source


Een van onze klanten binnen de industriesector draait meer dan 170 Kubernetes\-clusters, verspreid over on\-premise datacenters en Azure. Voor hen is het belangrijk om inzicht te krijgen in het energieverbruik van applicaties binnen die clusters, niet alleen voor intern gebruik, maar ook om hierover te kunnen rapporteren richting hun eigen klanten.


Maar dat is makkelijker gezegd dan gedaan. Kubernetes\-omgevingen zijn complex en zijn dynamisch van aard. Er bestaan wel open\-source tools, maar het is nog de vraag of die goed genoeg werken om energieverbruik en CO2\-uitstoot echt nauwkeurig en bruikbaar in beeld te brengen en te verminderen. Er is een gebrek aan duidelijkheid over de geschiktheid en toepasbaarheid van deze oplossingen in de context van energieverbruik en CO2\-uitstoot binnen het IT\-landschap, daarom is het tijd om dat uit te zoeken.

**De opdracht**
---------------


Jij gaat oplossingen onderzoeken en vergelijken voor het meten van energieverbruik binnen Kubernetes\-omgevingen. Het doel: aantonen dat dit verbruik inzichtelijk te maken is via een Proof of Concept.

  

Daarnaast onderzoek je hoe je real\-time CO2\-uitstoot van Kubernetes\-omgevingen inzichtelijk kunt maken, bijvoorbeeld via een koppeling met de lokale energiemix. Ook kijk je hoe je hierover kunt rapporteren op applicatie\- of productniveau. Zulke rapportages zijn waardevol om plannen te maken voor het terugdringen van uitstoot en het zichtbaar maken van de impact van IT.


Deze afstudeeropdracht biedt je de kans om te werken aan een actueel en technisch uitdagend vraagstuk, terwijl je relevante ervaring opdoet met duurzaamheid binnen Kubernetes\-clusters. En nog belangrijker: je draagt direct bij aan het verduurzamen van IT.


Je zou bijvoorbeeld kunnen werken aan:

* Een onderzoek naar de beste methodes en tools om energieverbruik te meten in Kubernetes, inclusief aanbevelingen voor gebruik bij klanten van Info Support.
* Een Proof of Concept voor een tool die energieverbruik in Kubernetes\-clusters effectief kan meten en visualiseren.
* Een vergelijkend onderzoek naar open\-source oplossingen voor het meten van energieverbruik en CO2\-uitstoot, gecombineerd met een Proof of Concept voor de meest veelbelovende oplossing.
* Een applicatie die real\-time inzicht geeft in CO2\-uitstoot via koppeling met data over de lokale energiemix.


Samen bepalen we welke scope en resultaten het best aansluiten bij jouw opleiding en interesses. Zo krijg je ruimte om je eigen stempel te drukken op de opdracht én op het eindresultaat.

Op dit moment kost het handmatig onderhouden van Infrastructure as Code (IaC) nog veel tijd, terwijl die beter besteed kan worden aan innovatie en development. In deze opdracht onderzoek je hoe monitoring en automatisering kunnen helpen om dit proces te verbeteren. Jouw uitdaging: een slimme aanpak ontwikkelen waarmee IaC moeiteloos up\-to\-date blijft, zodat developers efficiënter en effectiever kunnen werken.**

**Interessegebieden:** Azure, infrastructure, pipelines

  

Om de infrastructuur vast te leggen en herhaaldelijk uit te rollen, wordt gebruik gemaakt van BICEP of ARM, de Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\-oplossingen van Microsoft.


Hoewel deze aanpak helpt om infrastructuur gestructureerd en herbruikbaar te definiëren, is het proces om de IaC te onderhouden grotendeels handmatig. Dit proces kan behoorlijk tijdrovend zijn, terwijl deze tijd beter elders besteed kan worden.


We zien daarom een kans om dit proces gedeeltelijk te automatiseren. Zo is er meer tijd voor development\-georiënteerde projecten en klantgerichte features en hebben developers de ruimte om te focussen op het creëren van waardevolle functionaliteiten die directe impact hebben voor de klant.


Hieronder staan drie belangrijke uitdagingen die kunnen ontstaan wanneer IaC niet goed wordt bijgehouden. Dit biedt juist kansen om met een geautomatiseerd proces deze problemen op te lossen en de infrastructuurbeheerprocessen te verbeteren.


**Verouderde infrastructuur en onnodige kosten**


Wanneer de code niet regelmatig wordt bijgehouden, kunnen nieuwe infrastructuurversies of configuraties worden gemist. Dit kan leiden tot:

* Componenten die ""end of life"" zijn en niet meer worden ondersteund.
* Onnodige kosten doordat er nieuwere, goedkopere versies beschikbaar zijn die niet worden benut.

**Handmatige aanpassingen**


Handmatig uitgevoerde wijzigingen die niet in de IaC zijn vastgelegd maken het lastig om inzicht te krijgen in de infrastructuur. Dit leidt tot:

* Problemen bij latere updates of aanpassingen, omdat de code niet meer overeenkomt met de daadwerkelijke infrastructuur.
* Tijdrovende en foutgevoelige processen bij het handmatig controleren en bijwerken van de code, vooral in complexe omgevingen.

**Inconsistenties door tijdsdruk en handmatig werk**


Onder druk, bijvoorbeeld bij beveiligingsupdates of strakke deadlines, wordt de IaC soms genegeerd of worden wijzigingen handmatig doorgevoerd. Dit brengt risico's met zich mee, zoals:

* Inconsistenties tussen de code en de infrastructuur.
* Onduidelijkheid over welke wijzigingen zijn doorgevoerd en wat de impact ervan is.

**De opdracht**
---------------


Gedurende deze opdracht moeten de volgende drie onderzoeksvragen worden beantwoord:


* **Hoe kan de monitoring van nieuwe versies van infrastructuurcomponenten het beste worden geïntegreerd in bestaande projecten?**
Deze vraag richt zich op het vinden van de optimale methode om een monitoringoplossing te implementeren die automatisch controleert op nieuwe versies van de gebruikte infrastructuurcomponenten, zodat de code up\-to\-date blijft. Het is ook belangrijk om te onderzoeken hoe uitgebreid deze analyse kan zijn: blijft het beperkt tot het herkennen van nieuwe versies, of kan er ook advies worden gegeven over het gebruik van nieuwe componenten om kosten te besparen?


* **Hoe kan de consistentie tussen Infrastructure as Code en de werkelijke infrastructuur gewaarborgd worden?**
Deze vraag onderzoekt welke maatregelen genomen kunnen worden om ervoor te zorgen dat BICEP een valide bron van waarheid blijft voor de staat van de infrastructuur. Dit kan ook inhouden dat handmatige wijzigingen in het Azure Portal worden beperkt, hoewel dit ook zijn eigen nadelen met zich meebrengt. Het is dus niet noodzakelijk om naar een softwarematige oplossing te kijken.


* **Welke andere metrics met betrekking tot Infrastructure as Code zijn relevant om te monitoren, zodat de kwaliteit van de code verder kan worden verbeterd?**
Dit is een bredere vraag die onderzoekt of er, naast versies en consistentie, nog andere metrics van belang zijn voor het effectief onderhouden van infrastructure as code.
Tijdens deze opdracht moeten de volgende twee problemen worden aangepakt:


* **Onvoldoende inzicht in nieuwe versies van infrastructuurcomponenten**
Het is lastig om te weten wanneer er nieuwe versies van de gebruikte componenten beschikbaar zijn. Dit kan leiden tot verouderde configuraties, die mogelijk niet optimaal of veilig zijn.


* **Inconsistentie tussen de Infrastructure as Code en de werkelijke infrastructuur**
Handmatige wijzigingen in de werkelijke infrastructuur worden niet altijd in de code vastgelegd, waardoor de code niet meer overeenkomt met de feitelijke situatie. Dit kan leiden tot misconfiguraties en onderhoudsproblemen.


Het doel van de opdracht is om deze problemen op te lossen, op basis van de bevonden methoden uit het onderzoek.

**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Er komt heel wat kijken bij het beheer van onze databaseplatformen. Jouw baan is dus erg veelzijdig. Van het opschonen, migreren, beschikbaar stellen en beveiligen van de MSSQL\-databases tot het configureren van MSSQL\-platformen en verbeteren van de performance ervan. Ook zet je jouw kennis in om te kijken hoe onze dienstverlening nog beter kan, inclusief de mogelijkheden van de Azure public cloud.. Kennis die je graag deelt met je collega’s.

**Jouw rol als dealmaker / bidmanager bij ITQ:**


Als dealmaker \& bidmanager ben je verantwoordelijk voor het coördineren en beheren van het gehele bid\-proces, vanaf het moment dat we verwachten dat de RfP komt, tot en met het indienen van de definitieve offerte en daarna, bij voorlopige gunning, voor de onderhandelingen en contractering. Waarbij hij gedurende de bid fase\* ook verantwoordelijk is voor het bepalen, samen met het team, van de winstrategie.


Deze functie vereist een combinatie van projectmanagement\-vaardigheden, strategisch en analytisch denken, uitstekende communicatievaardigheden waarbij het ook belangrijk is dat de bidmanager zijn regie\- en coördinerende rol durft te pakken.

De focus ligt op het ontwikkelen van een winnende strategie, onderhandelen over contractvoorwaarden en het bewaken van deadlines. Een dealmaker richt zich meer op de commerciële en strategische aspecten van een deal, terwijl een bidmanager zorgt voor een gestructureerd en compliant bidproces. Samenwerken met interne\- en externe stakeholders is essentieel om een sterke waarde propositie neer te zetten en gedragenheid te verkrijgen. De bidmanager beheert het volledige tenderproces en zorgt ervoor dat alle technische, juridische en financiële aspecten kloppen.
