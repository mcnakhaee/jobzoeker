For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to preempt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

Are you fascinated by sustainability issues and do you have experience and affinity with researching the effects of land use on climate? Then we are looking for you!***  

  

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research into monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).  

  

While the team’s main focus is on forests we also conduct research into the role of land use and forest management in greenhouse gas emissions and removals in a broader context involving the whole LULUCF sector, including other land uses. Team members are responsible for the compilation of the national greenhouse gas inventory for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. For this we develop and work with geographically explicit instruments (such as models and monitoring) that can be used to determine the effects of the management or change in land use of forests, cropland, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other land. We closely collaborate with other experts on land use and soil at Wageningen Environmental Research and external research institutes to bring together all required information for the LULUCF monitoring.  

  

We use our knowledge and tools to draw up the international (Climate Convention, Paris Agreement, EU) and national (Climate and Energy Outlook) reports of greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. With our science-based expertise we also support the development and evaluation of climate policy of the Dutch government and European Commission. For instance, we currently support the European Commission in drafting the methodologies for certification of carbon removals in forests, wetlands and agricultural soils (carbon farming).  

  

**Your duties and responsibilities:**  

As LULUCF researcher you will contribute to further improving our methodologies for calculating carbon stock changes towards higher Tier levels according to the IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. This will involve the compilation and collection of new emission factors for carbon stock changes in living biomass, dead organic matter or soils and/or emissions of methane or nitrous oxide due to land use or land use change.  

  

Depending on your expertise you will be responsible for the improvements for several land use categories covered by the LULUCF sector and/or the further development of spatially explicit approaches. You also contribute to the acquisition of new externally funded projects.  

  

**You will work here**  

You will be placed in the team SFE of WENR, based at the Wageningen Campus of Wageningen University and Research, but you will also collaborate intensively with colleagues in other teams at WENR as well as with researchers in other research institutes in the Netherlands and internationally.  

  

You will be working in an enthusiastic team of about 24 colleagues working on options for conservation, restoration, development and sustainable use of trees and forests from an ecological perspective. We focus on the way in which policy, management and climate affect ecological processes and what their consequences are for climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and restoration, delivery of ecosystem services and other specific policy goals.  

  

The team offers a stimulating working environment combining first class expertise and young enthusiasm! To get a taste of the team read this post! Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment.

Additionally, a contract for 32 hours can be discussed. You will initially receive a one-year contract, which can be extended further if there is mutual enthusiasm.

Read the 5 reasons why your future colleagues enjoy working at WUR and watch the video below to get an idea of our green campus!

**Omschrijving**
----------------


The Soil Physics and Land Management chair group at Wageningen University and Research is seeking a postdoc researcher in hydrological modelling who will be responsible for the numerical modelling work in project RESTARTIN: “Restructuring and enhancing strategies with a transformative approach for integrated water disaster management in India and the Netherlands”. This work will involve not only the modelling itself, but also the use of high-resolution satellite imagery to assess vegetation water conditions for calibration, the design of land-use change scenarios (eventually with modelling), and interactions with stakeholders and socioeconomic researchers to translate potential adaptation options into practice.  

Your duties and responsibilities include:

+ apply a surface and groundwater model to several regions in the Netherlands (Limburg, Brabant and Holland);
+ assess climate change scenarios and design compatible land-use scenarios;
+ assess the impact of climate change on flood and drought conditions;
+ test potential adaptation options in coordination with stakeholders;
+ some involvement in related educational activities is possible.
**You will work here**  

You will work in project RESTARTIN, jointly funded by NWO and DST-India. Most of the work will be developed within the Soil Physics and Land Management chair group in WUR. But it will be closely coordinated with researchers at IHE-Delft working on detailed risk assessment and socioeconomic analysis. It will also be closely linked with similar activities being performed by Indian researchers in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra. Some travelling to India is therefore expected.


The intended starting date of this position is 1 September 2024.

**Functie-eisen**
-----------------


You hold a PhD degree in hydro(geo)logy, environmental sciences or equivalent. You also possess:

+ strong and broad conceptual and methodological knowledge of hydrology at the soil-water-plant and watershed scales, including relevant numerical models (e.g., HEC-HMS/RAS, SWMM, HBV, SWAT, SHE, VIC, MODFLOW, CATHY, HGS, FEFLOW, DSSAT, etc.), and model calibration/validation techniques;
+ in-depth experience with GIS packages (e.g., ArcGIS, Qgis) and advanced data analysis techniques;
+ in-depth experience with scripting in R, MATLAB, Python, FORTRAN, etc.;
+ experience in scientific writing, conducting research, and a publication record in hydrology;
+ ability to work independently and to take ownership of the assigned tasks, including making independent decisions on implementation details.

We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”



Unique to this job  

We are an international, dynamic, highly motivated team of scientists at different stages of our careers with a strong drive to push research for the benefit of Public Health. We combine expertise in immunology, virology, and bioinformatics and believe in the strength of collaboration and working together as a team.

**Job Description:**

**IT Internship: GenAI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision**
==============================================================


Are you a student looking to launch your Information Technology career? If so, then UPS is the place for you! We will give you the opportunity to work on practical business problem in the Logistic industry using Digitization techniques and Artificial Intelligence.


UPS is a leader in Information Technology. If you are a highly motivated student working on a degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, Mathematics, Engineering, Business, Human Resources, Finance, or a related degree, then UPS is a great place for you to start your career.


Explore your next opportunity at a Global Fortune 500 organization. Envision innovative possibilities, experience our rewarding culture, and work with talented teams that help you excel every day. We know what it takes to lead UPS into tomorrow, – people with a unique combination of skills and passion. If you have the qualities and drive to lead yourself then this role will help you to cultivate your skills and take you to the next level. As a part of the internship, you will have opportunity to learn and develop the following business cases:

**Document Indexing (DOCIDX)**


Indexing scanned documents based on an embedded barcode of any type like CODE39, QR... is essential for any later processing, such as storage and retrieval, distribution to other departments or customer, and other back-office processing. We would like you to work on creating a reusable interface to index scanned documents in bulk, easily customizable for any environment and task.

**Package Type Detection (PKGDCT)**


UPS operates a large number of automated package-processing facilities. Not all packages processed have the perfect cube shape and size. We need to detect the shape of the packages (e.g., envelope, regular box, big size, irregular…) so that they are processed with the care required for each type, or even detect warning conditions like broken packages or liquid leaks.

**Job Description:**


As a computer vision scientist, you will review the current process flow the cases for image acquisition, either paper-based or digital documents for the case #1 and explore different options to capture package images from operational facilities to be later processed in case #2. For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to pre-empt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

**This position requires one or more of the following technical or business skills:**

* Proficiency in computer vision tools and algorithms.
* Strong mathematical skills to help collect, measure, organize and analyse data
* Knowledge of programming languages like SQL, Oracle, R, MATLAB, Java, and Python
* Technical proficiency regarding database design development, data models, techniques for data mining, and segmentation

Experience in reporting/creating dashboards with Power BI, Looker, programming (Javascript, XML, or ETL frameworks), databases, and working with Google Cloud Platform  
* 

  

**This position requires one or more of the following soft skills:**

* Effective communication
* Responsibility
* Accountability
* Adaptability
* Willingness/eagerness to learn.
* Independently
* Resiliency
* Problem-solving skills

**What is expected from you (and from the University)?**

* Data Privacy and Confidentiality, that will be ensured by signing the Non-Disclosure Agreement with UPS
* Full participation in all the project steps
* Take-up assignments and tasks and deliver them with quality and speed according to Agile project timeline
* Handover all deliverables (project documentation, software and algorithms developed) to UPS as Intellectual Property and not to be used outside the internship program
* At the end of the internship the intern will be given the opportunity to present results to the Europe IT management team (optional), UPS Mentor and University coach

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-------------------


Join us – we look forward to welcoming you to our Self-Organizing Soft Matter Research Group at Eindhoven University of Technology!


We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Researcher with a passion for quantitative microscopy and physical chemistry of self-assembling materials to join our team to image the behavior of ice-interactive biomaterials on ice with single-molecule resolution. The goal of your project is to develop and use state-of-the-art microscopy tools and quantitative image analysis approaches to discover the physical principles underpinning the activity of novel ice-interactive biomaterials and to tune their interaction with ice to modulate activity as desired.


Key Responsibilities:


* Conduct high-quality, curiosity-driven, original, and independent research focusing on quantitative imaging and super-resolution microscopy of self-assembling materials
* Collaborate with a multi-disciplinary and international team of researchers
* Present research findings at conferences and publish in top-tier scientific journals
* Mentor and support junior researchers in the lab


The formation and growth of ice during freezing, storage, and/or thawing of cryopreserved materials limits the potential of cryopreservation technology for the long-term storage of sensitive materials, such as cells, tissues, and organs. Our group aims to unravel how biological and engineered ice-interactive materials function so that we can create customized chemical cryoprotectants for biomedical and other applications. Recently, we reported sub-zero super-resolution microscopy experiments which allowed us to study for the first time the interfacial dynamics of ice-bound ice-binding proteins at the single molecule level (see PNAS publication for more information). In this project you will build upon these pioneering experiments. You will image the interaction with ice of a novel class of engineered ice-interactive materials at the single molecule level to advance our understanding of how their structure and properties impact their ability to modulate ice crystal formation and growth. In this exciting role, you will work in a vibrant and international research group aiming to advance molecular insight into the working mechanism of novel ice-interactive materials for biomedical applications.

Are you an ambitious bioinformatician with a solid background in omics data analysis and experience in the field of immunology and/or infectious disease research? Then this bioinformatician position is the job for you!



Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work.

Join us on our journey as Splunk Solution Engineer, and enjoy a culture of inclusiveness, disruption, and fun while selling smart and winning big.
What’s the role of a Solution Engineer at Splunk?* You will technically own, discover, position, prove and deliver the key technical elements of a sales cycle to achieve a ‘technical win’ within large scale and complex customer environments. You’ll use a range of communication styles, a range of technology skills and experiences and a range of soft skills and people skills to develop trust relationships with both your sales colleagues and your customers.
* You will be an advocate and ambassador for Splunk through your professional social media, industry and marketing events and supporting pipeline generation activities
* You will collaborate with your customer contacts, and build them into Splunk champions, by helping them to understand how Splunk can help them to solve some of their most challenging problems and help them achieve their objectives.


Responsibilities:* Ability to demonstrate Splunk products and services to customers on site, remotely via webinar sessions, and at field events such as conferences and trade shows.
* Establish and maintain strong relationships throughout the sales cycle with all levels within the customer.

* Technically Astute: You enjoy the detail, even if you don’t always need to express it. You have a thirst for up-to-date knowledge of the technologies and solutions that businesses use to be successful as they transform.
* Confidence: But not arrogant – you have the confidence that comes from the knowledge that your product is rock solid, and the ability to transmit this confidence to a customer. That means you might sit down with a customer already using your product to show them how they might use it even better!
* Business Savvy: You understand how businesses are organized, how they achieve their desired results, what challenges they are likely to face, what solutions they need and what transformations they could make with your solutions.
* A growth mindset: You build in time to develop your skills, knowledge, experience or capabilities. You look beyond the current opportunity towards the wider set of opportunities that could exist in a prospect.
* A Collaborator: You understand that selling is a team game, so you spend time developing your network of colleagues and partners to achieve your success – and theirs.
* Competitive: If you’re in it, you want to win it!
* Fun: Getting the job done and enjoying & generating fun don’t need to be mutually exclusive.
* The candidate must be based in the Netherlands and be fluent in Dutch and English.


Helpful technical skills or experience (not all required, but consider how Splunk could benefit from your background)* Domain knowledge and experience in any of the following areas: IT infrastructure, Cloud Technologies, Application Delivery, Business Analytics or Log Management

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users.

The Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) is seeking a creative and entrepreneurial candidate to join its offices in Groningen or Nairobi as a Climate Change Adaptation Economist.  



  

GCA is a leading international organization dedicated to addressing climate change and promoting adaptation action for resilient development. We collaborate with governments, International Financial Institutions (IFIs), businesses, and communities to develop and implement innovative solutions that strengthen resilience and support adaptation to climate change impacts.  



  

At GCA, you’ll contribute to transformative projects that make a lasting impact on global climate resilience. You’ll have the freedom to innovate and the support to bring your bold ideas to life.

GCA’s strategy in Africa is implemented under the flagship Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP), launched by GCA and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to scale up adaptation efforts and mobilize finance for climate-resilient development in Africa. To date, GCA has integrated adaptation solutions into $9 billion worth of investments funded by IFIs across Africa. GCA’s work under the AAAP focuses on four pillars where investments in adaptation and resilience building can yield high economic dividends for African nations, including: Food security; Infrastructure and Nature-based Solutions; Youth entrepreneurship and adaptation jobs; and Adaptation finance.

You will delve into the critical linkages between infrastructure disruption and broader societal dimensions such as food security, livelihoods, and overall wellbeing. Your expertise will be key in identifying how infrastructure resilience directly affects international trade, national economies and community resilience, uncovering complex interdependencies and providing actionable insights for resilience strategies. Through your research you will play a significant role in comprehending and articulating the effects that infrastructure disruption or development can have on societal stability and progress with respect to climate adaptation.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

De opleiding


De opleiding Applied Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (ADS&AI) is voor studenten die begrijpen dat, naast technische en niet-technische competenties, de ontwikkelde AI oplossingen ook een verantwoordelijkheid met zich meebrengen (responsible AI).


We staan als opleiding voor een open en respectvolle leeromgeving en vinden het belangrijk dat onze studenten met plezier en vertrouwen hun studie volgen. Er is gekozen voor een geïntegreerd onderwijsconcept waarbij de ontwikkelingsgerichtheid van de student centraal staat. Dat betekent dat de student gericht wordt opgeleid aan de hand van onze zes competenties (responsible technology, drie technische competenties en twee professionele competenties). Studenten ontvangen regelmatig feedback en mogen fouten maken. Vertrouwen opbouwen in hun eigen kunnen is iets wat we de studenten mee willen geven.


We leren studenten om oplossingen en toepassingen voor uiteenlopende stakeholders te onderzoeken, te ontwerpen en te bouwen. De studenten worden niet alleen technisch goed onderlegd, ze leren ook te adviseren en communiceren over inzichten en oplossingen. Het onderwijs richt zich voornamelijk op projecten waarbij we zo dicht mogelijk de praktijk proberen te benaderen. Dit doen we in het 1e studiejaar aan de hand van vier thema’s: data driven society, smart & social city, data driven logistics en data supported healthcare. Er wordt vooral met echte opdrachtgevers gewerkt.

We staan als opleiding voor een open en respectvolle leeromgeving en vinden het belangrijk dat onze studenten met plezier en vertrouwen hun studie volgen. Er is gekozen voor een geïntegreerd onderwijsconcept waarbij de ontwikkelingsgerichtheid van de student centraal staat. Dat betekent dat de student gericht wordt opgeleid aan de hand van onze zes competenties (responsible technology, drie technische competenties en twee professionele competenties). Studenten ontvangen regelmatig feedback en mogen fouten maken. Vertrouwen opbouwen in hun eigen kunnen is iets wat we de studenten mee willen geven.


We leren studenten om oplossingen en toepassingen voor uiteenlopende stakeholders te onderzoeken, te ontwerpen en te bouwen. De studenten worden niet alleen technisch goed onderlegd, ze leren ook te adviseren en communiceren over inzichten en oplossingen. Het onderwijs richt zich voornamelijk op projecten waarbij we zo dicht mogelijk de praktijk proberen te benaderen. Dit doen we in het 1e studiejaar aan de hand van vier thema’s: data driven society, smart & social city, data driven logistics en data supported healthcare. Er wordt vooral met echte opdrachtgevers gewerkt.

**Your job**
------------


How the overturning circulation of the Mediterranean Sea responds to variations in forcing (tectonics and climate) is a fundamental question that potentially has global significance given that Mediterranean circulation has elements in common with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. It is also a highly relevant question for the countries bordering the sea in view of our warming climate.


In this NWO (Dutch Research Council)-funded project we will exploit the paleoceanographical record of the late Quaternary which provides an exceptional dataset on e.g. water properties, intensity of intermediate and deep-water formation and strait flow. You will design and execute experiments with dynamic box models and evaluate their results using the available data. The geometrically simple box model is chosen because it can be run following the evolution of circulation and water properties through time, thus doing justice to the transient nature of the processes at play. The analysis will focus on the role of:


* the Strait of Sicily;
* the properties of the inflowing waters; and
* sea-level variation.


You will be based at the department of Earth Sciences where you will be part of a vibrant PhD community and where expertise in both paleoceanography/paleoclimate and numerical modelling is amply available.


A personalised training programme will be set up, reflecting your training needs and career objectives. About 20% of your time will be dedicated to this training component, which includes training on the job in assisting in the Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes of the department.


**Your qualities**
------------------


You must have completed your MSc degree in Earth Sciences, Physical Oceanography, or a related discipline by the time the position starts. We seek candidates that have a keen interest in working on the interface between marine geology and physical oceanography. The ideal candidate:


* has knowledge of and experience with numerical modelling applied to Earth’s processes, using programming languages such as Python, MATLAB or R;
* has a solid basis in physics - specific knowledge regarding physical oceanography or (geophysical) fluid mechanics is an asset;
* is trained in the concepts of sedimentary geology required for this project: aspects of sedimentology, stratigraphy and paleoceanography;
* is willing and able to interact with specialists in the various disciplines that come together in this project.


Due to the international character of our department, good command of spoken and written English is essential. We highly encourage applicants from all members of our community and of diverse backgrounds to join us.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for one year, with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period;
* a working week of 36 hours and a gross monthly salary between €2,770 and €3,539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research are recruiting a:

 **Postdoc position Pharmacometrics for anti-infective pharmacology and pandemic preparedness (2 positions available)**  

**Vacancy number: 15017**


The Division of Systems Pharmacology and Pharmacy (SPP) of the Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR) aims to develop quantitative precision medicine approaches to predict variation in treatment response and enhance translational drug development strategies. Our ambition is to impact development of personalized treatment strategies and innovative translational drug development through integration with clinical data, including patient data. We develop new methodological advances at the interface of quantitative systems- and clinical pharmacology/pharmacometrics and other disciplines such as innovative experimental disease models, emerging biomarker technologies, state-of-the art biophysical tools, and advanced statistical/ ML/ AI-approaches.

**Project description**  

We have two postdoc positions available within the ZonMW-funded project “PPP-COMPUTE: A Pandemic Pharmacology Platform for model-based optimization of anti-infectives”.


In PPP-COMPUTE we aim to establish a versatile computational platform to facilitate early clinical development of novel anti-infective treatments, with a focus on viral and bacterial pathogens, to support efficient pandemic drug development activities. During a pandemic there exists a need for rapid evaluation of potential therapeutic modalities. Tools to rapidly predict treatment strategies and optimize the design of clinical trials for novel anti-infectives agents against emerging pathogens are therefore essential. The ability to generate such clinical predictions relies on effective integration of data concerning the relationship between (expected) concentrations of the therapeutic agent (pharmacokinetics, PK) in patients and the associated effects on pathogen clearance (pharmacodynamics, PD).


The PPP-COMPUTE platform will consist of several integrated computational pharmacological mechanism-based PK/PD models to rapidly evaluate and predict optimal (combination) treatment strategies (e.g., dosing schedules) and clinical trial designs for potential therapeutic agents, building on established models, and experimental and clinical data already available in the public domain. The framework will be implemented as a public web-application. PPP-COMPUTE will involve clinical stakeholders through collaborating with the recently established INFECT-NL consortium, which aims to establish key infrastructure for early clinical trials of anti-infectives. Finally, the developed modeling framework may be integrated with epidemiological mathematical models which study the effect of novel therapeutic interventions on pathogen transmission dynamics on a population level.


For the available two postdoc positions, we are ideally seeking one individual with a strong track record in pharmacometric and ideally mechanism-based modeling, while for the second position we seek a candidate with a rack record in development of web-applications (R/Shiny) and handling large scale data, in addition to knowledge of pharmacometric/PKPD modeling.

**Key responsibilities**

* Conduct original research in the area of translational pharmacology of anti-infectives in the context of pandemic preparedness;
* Develop and implement mechanism-based and population PK/PD based mathematical models for anti-infectives to support translation between preclinical and clinical data of anti-infective agents;
* Develop a user-friendly web-applications (R/Shiny) which implement the developed models;
* Engage in collaborative research within the project;
* Publish scientific articles at international peer-review journals;
* Presentation of results internally and at (inter-) national conferences;
* Possible support of education activities in the bachelor and master programs of biopharmaceutical sciences.

**Selection Criteria**

* PhD degree in the area of quantitative pharmacology, pharmacometrics or systems pharmacology, or a related (quantitative) discipline;
* Strong experience with modelling approaches in pharmacometrics and/or systems pharmacology applied to clinical and/or preclinical data;
* Experience in R programming and modelling software tools such as NONMEM, Monolix, or nlmixr;
* Experience with viral dynamic modelling is desirable;
* Knowledge of anti-infectives and infectious diseases;
* Strong communication and writing skills;
* Ability to work independently as well as part of a team;
* Excellent organisational and planning skills;
* Full proficiency in English;
* Enthusiastic, highly motivated, and independent thinker.

 Apply Now
Join ReBioClim, a Project Aiming to Pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in Four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.
* Ability to work independently and in a result-oriented way.
* Availability to start in January 2025.


Nice-to-haves:


* Experience in conducting geospatial analysis in a programming environment such as R or Python.
* Knowledge of co-design workshop methodologies.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

-------------------


  
In de rol van onderzoeker/data-analist bij Zicht op Ondermijning lever je een belangrijke bijdrage aan een weerbaar bestuur. Door onderzoek te doen naar de aanwezigheid van fenomenen die mogelijk duiden op de aanwezigheid van crimineel ondermijnend gedrag, draag je bij aan het versterken van de informatiepositie van lokale overheden (o.a. gemeenten). Je werkzaamheden beginnen met het in kaart brengen van de informatiebehoefte van de lokale overheden en het formuleren van een passende onderzoeksvraag. Deze onderzoeksvraag beantwoord je met behulp van relevante CBS-data en eventueel externe data bronnen. Een voorbeeld van een analyse waar je aan zou kunnen gaan werken is het in kaart brengen van gebieden met een hoog aandeel bedrijven die betrokken waren bij verdachte transacties. Hiervoor gebruiken we zowel externe data over verdachte transacties (FIU) als een groot aantal door het CBS beschikbaar gestelde bestanden met informatie over bedrijven en eigenaren en bestuurders van bedrijven. Het doel van deze analyse is om lokale overheden te laten zien welke mogelijke risico’s op het gebied van witwassen er binnen jouw gemeente zijn.

---------------------------------------



Directie Democratie en Bestuur  

Een betrouwbare en goed functionerende democratie, daarvoor zetten wij ons als directie Democratie en Bestuur in. We werken aan versterking van de band tussen kiezers en gekozenen, een betere toerusting en ondersteuning van politieke ambtsdragers en een weerbaar effectief bestuur. Als directie hebben we een brede sociaal-maatschappelijke oriëntatie en dragen bij aan de oplossing van spanningen, dilemma’s en actuele vraagstukken op het snijvlak van politiek, bestuur en samenleving. De directie bestaat uit vier afdelingen; Democratie, Inrichting Openbaar Bestuur, Ondersteuning Bestuur en Politieke Ambtsdragers en Weerbaarheid, met daarbinnen onder andere het programma Slavernijverleden en het Nationaal Programma Leefbaarheid en Veiligheid.  

Ons werk speelt zich af in het hart van de democratie. Je komt te werken in een dynamische omgeving waar we samen hard werken en topkwaliteit willen leveren. Werkplezier en je ontwikkeling staan daarin centraal. We vinden diversiteit belangrijk. Verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en inzichten zorgen ervoor dat we beter aansluiten bij de behoeften uit de samenleving.  

  

Afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur  

De nieuwe afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur levert een bijdrage aan de uitvoering van de missie en visie van de directie D&B, onder meer door de informatiepositie van het decentraal bestuur op complexe opgaven te vergroten en op projectmatige wijze (uitvoerings)beleid en werkvormen te ontwikkelen die goed verbonden zijn met de praktijk van het decentraal bestuur. Op korte termijn is de opgave van de afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur om de methodiek van Zicht op Ondermijning structureel te borgen. De afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur is verantwoordelijk voor de kwaliteit van de 'Zicht op-methode' en het organiseren, uitbreiden en onderhouden van het brede samenwerkingsverband en het maken van afspraken met interne en externe netwerkpartners.  

Om de meerwaarde van de 'Zicht-op methode' voor bredere inzet binnen het decentraal bestuur te vergroten werkt de afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur aan bewustwording rond (ondermijnings)risico's; versterking van de informatiepositie van decentraal bestuur (o.a. via de Zicht-op methode); het aanreiken van handelingsperspectief; het ontwikkelen van een kennis en leernetwerk en expertpool; ontwikkeling van monitoring en rapportage en onderzoek ten behoeve van de bestuurlijk-preventieve aanpak vanuit het decentraal bestuur.



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.

**De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie!**

**Wie zoeken wij?**

Voor ons hoofdkantoor in Amersfoort zoeken wij per direct een AI Solutions Developer.

In deze rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verkennen en implementeren van de mogelijkheden van generative AI, zoals ChatGPT, om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren.

Je hebt een relevante WO-opleiding afgerond of bijna afgerond, zoals Informatica of Data Science, en beschikt over aantoonbare kennis en interesse op het gebied van AI, machine learning en data-analyse. Daarnaast heb je sterke analytische vaardigheden en ben je in staat om complexe technische problemen op te lossen. Ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python, R of Java is een vereiste, evenals kennis van cloud computing en ervaring met platforms zoals AWS, Azure of Google Cloud.

Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief samen te werken in een team zijn van essentieel belang. Je bent proactief, leergierig en kunt goed omgaan met veranderingen en uitdagingen. Daarnaast heb je een sterke drive om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en ICT-management.

**Wat ga je doen?**

Deze functie is nieuw binnen Lab21, wat betekent dat je een grote invloed hebt op de invulling ervan. Je zult een onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren. Als Junior ICT Manager speel je een belangrijke rol bij het implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen binnen ons bedrijf. Je werkt nauw samen met verschillende teams om de behoeften van de organisatie in kaart te brengen en technologische oplossingen aan te dragen. Je analyseert en optimaliseert bestaande systemen en processen en identificeert kansen om AI-technologieën toe te passen.

**Plaats in de organisatie:**

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

---------------------------------------



Afdeling Beleidsinformatie zorgt ervoor dat de vier directies binnen het DG Digitalisering en Overheidsorganisaties (DGDDOO) de juiste informatie tot hun beschikking hebben om effectief beleid te voeren. Dat doen we door de juiste gegevens binnen de Rijksoverheid samen te brengen en te analyseren. Om dit goed te kunnen doen onderhouden we nauw contact met de verschillende departementale contactpersonen.  

We geven gevraagd en ongevraagd advies aan onze beleidscollega's op basis van verkregen inzichten. We maken terugkerende rapportages zoals de Jaarrapportage Bedrijfsvoering Rijk, maar doen ook ad hoc analyses of uitgebreider onderzoek. We zijn werkzaam op de verschillende terreinen van bedrijfsvoering zoals inkoop, duurzaamheid, ICT, personeel, facilitair en huisvesting.


De zes directies van het DG Digitalisering en Overheidsorganisaties (DGDOO) die de afdeling ondersteunt zijn: Digitale Overheid (DO), Digitale Samenleving (DS), CIO Rijk, Programma Open Overheid, Ambtenaar en Organisatie (AO), en Inkoop-, Facilitair en Huisvestingsbeleid Rijk (IFHR).



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.

* vaardigheden in het gebruik van statistische software (zoals SPSS of R).


Daarnaast spreek en schrijf je uitstekend Nederlands. Omdat een deel van het onderzoek wordt uitgevoerd in samenwerking met internationale collega’s, is het belangrijk dat je het Engels voldoende beheerst.


**Wat bieden wij?**
-------------------


Wij bieden:


* een functie voor vier jaar;
* een werkweek van 36 tot 40 uur met een bruto maandsalaris van minimaal € 2.770,- tot maximaal € 3.539,- bij een fulltime dienstverband (schaal P van de cao Nederlandse Universiteiten);

The institute aims to provide the highest level of care for all children with cancer and has the ambition to cure all children of cancer and improve quality of life. The center brings together the best possible care and scientific research, creating a unique interdisciplinary institute for pediatric oncology in Europe.


**Research project**



In cancer, a correct and timely diagnosis is essential in order to start the optimal treatment. For solid tumors the initial diagnosis is established on the basis of morphology and immunohistochemistry. However, an increasing number of tumor entities require molecular profiling of the tumor, based on which a treatment protocol is chosen. This molecular profiling can take up to 14 days, thereby delaying the start of treatment. We have recently demonstrated the potential of nanopore methylation sequencing-based classification in the diagnostics of CNS tumors, where we’ve developed methodology to acquire a molecular diagnosis while the patient is in surgery (Vermeulen et al., Nature 2023). In the current project the goal is to extend this technology to the domain of solid tumors in order to ultimately reduce time to molecular diagnosis from 14 days down to 24 hours.



This is a 4-year project that is subsidized by KiKa. As a PhD student in this project you will be in charge of developing artificial intelligence models that work with nanopore sequencing data in order to classify diagnostic samples of solid tumors into the correct tumor types. You will be based both in the Princess Maxima Center and in the University Medical Center Utrecht. This combination allows close collaboration with both the clinical experts on pediatric oncology in the Princess Maxima Center and the artificial intelligence experts in the University Medical Center Utrecht.


**Profile**



We are looking for an enthusiastic, curious PhD candidate with a background in (molecular) biology who is eager to learn, has good organizational skills and has experience with artificial intelligence. You are creative and think out-of-the box. You enjoy fundamental research, but are also driven to bring your research into clinical care. You work well in a dynamic environment.


**Qualifications**


* Master’s degree in (molecular) biology
* Experience with artificial intelligence, preferably neural networks
* Experience in programming in python and/or R
* Demonstrated experience in research
* Interest in translational childhood cancer research
* You enjoy working in and contributing to a multidisciplinary team


**The Kester and the De Ridder Groups**



This project is a collaboration between the Kester research group in the Princess Maxima Center for pediatric oncology and the de Ridder research group in the University Medical Center Utrecht. The Kester research group is embedded within the diagnostic laboratory of the Princess Maxima Center and focusses on translational research that will improve diagnostics for pediatric oncology patients. The De Ridder group focusses on the development of artificial intelligence algorithms that can directly have an impact on patient care.

-----------------


The section Ecology & Evolution, part of the Amsterdam Institute for Life and Environment (A-LIFE) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam invites applications for an ambitious PhD position that will combine innovative bioinformatics and genomic tools to study captive and wild red panda genomes for conservation. Are you interested? Keep reading and apply at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam!


Understanding the population structure of (sub)species is crucial for both wildlife conservation and effective population management of back-up populations in zoos, given the potential harm hybridization poses to the reintroduction potential of zoo animals. The red panda (*Ailurus fulgens*) is an endangered mammal with only 2,500 to 10,000 individuals in the wild. Debate is ongoing whether the species should be split into two distinct species: *Ailurus fulgens fulgens* and *Ailurus fulgens styani.* This project aims to assess the genetic health of the worldwide zoo population and determine the taxonomic origin of its founders. Additionally, the candidate will explore genomic compatibility between populations to predict the potential effect of hybridization. In collaboration with the international studbook keeper of the red panda zoo population, based at Rotterdam zoo, we will use long- and short read whole genome sequence data from key individuals from the zoo population with an additional reference dataset of re-sequenced wild individuals. This project will develop a genomics-informed framework for conservation and reintroduction of red pandas, and could potentially set a new standard for the field of conservation genomics.


The successful applicant will bring together the expertise of Dr. Mirte Bosse, who is in the forefront of the exciting new field of conservation genomics, and Janno Weerman, who is the international studbook keeper of the worldwide zoo population of red pandas. The PhD candidate will be embedded in the Ecology&Evolution group at the VU in close collaboration with Rotterdam Zoo and the Animal Breeding and Genomics group of Wageningen University. The candidate will have the opportunity to frequently work from Rotterdam Zoo, and will engage in a research network with international academic partners, zoos and NGOs.


**Your duties**


* develop a high-quality reference genome for each red panda (sub)species using nanopore technologies
* explore structural genomic differences between populations by combining de novo assemblies with long and short reads
* perform population genomics analyses on re-sequenced animals to better understand population structure in situ and ex situ
* analyze genetic load in the zoo population in comparison with the wild, and develop framework to implement this information in the breeding programme
* developing a framework for decision-making on planned reintroductions based on genomic information.
* authoring and co-authoring manuscripts submitted to high quality journals
* provide support to teaching of the section (<10% of your time)
* frequently present your work at internal and external (national or international) meetings, and to non-academic stakeholders


**Your profile**
----------------

* MSc in one of the following fields: Biology, Genetics, Animal Breeding, Conservation sciences and/or Bioinformatics, or a related field
* you should have at least experience with bioinformatics and genomics (details below):
* experience (or affinity) with programming in Python, R, bash
* experience (or affinity) with next- and third generation sequencing technology such as Illumina, PacBio or Oxford Nanopore and some experience with downstream analysis of sequence data
* experience with the red panda model system is an advantage, but not necessary
* a good ability to speak, write and read English
* affinity with outreach activities and working in an international multidisciplinary team


As a university, we strive for equal opportunities for all, recognising that diversity takes many forms. We believe that diversity in all its complexity is invaluable for the quality of our teaching, research and service. We are always looking for talent with diverse backgrounds and experiences.

The Faculty of Science and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) are looking for:

**PhD candidate | Environmental impact assessment of pollution at the ecosystem level (0.8-1.0 fte)**

**Vacancy number: (14994)**


**Background**


The freshwater system and its adjacent ecosystems host countless species because of their need of water. These are the earths’ natural capital and drivers of many ecosystem services we humans depend on. At the same time, the presence and effects of anthropogenic stress in the aquatic environment are multitude and ubiquitous. These include the omnipresence of chemical pollution such as the use of agricultural chemicals.


To relatively quickly assess the impacts of chemicals a standard risk assessment framework is in place. While valuable, the frameworks often lacks ecological realism. Researchers from Leiden University therefore experiment in outdoor freshwater experimental systems with natural food webs such as the “Levend Lab” (EN: “Living Lab”, https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/livinglab) to identify how biodiversity responds to the impacts of pesticides, fertilizers, invasive species and nanomaterials.


Using ecological theory, a large array of different experimental and statistical analytical methods are currently in practice to perform and analyze such experiments. The key challenge for the PhD candidate is to test these different forms of experimental and statistical analytical methods to identify stressor - ecosystem function relationships. The research will likely entail measuring different forms of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functionality followed by statistical modelling to infer causality of stressor impacts and their propagation through the ecosystem.


We invite prospective candidates to unravel the intricate network of species interactions between each other and their environment. The candidate will use new analytical methods and develops models and interpretation scenarios to identify how pollution impacts species and their role in ecosystem functionality.

**Key tasks:**

* *Perform* mesocosm pollution experiments in the ‘Levend Lab’ facility of Leiden University
* *Further develop* and test different types of statistical analyses at the community to ecosystem level
* *Advance* ecological theory by identifying the anthropological and natural drivers of species and their roles in ecosystems

**Selection criteria:**

* You should have an M.Sc. in a relevant field (environmental science, biology, ecology and/or ecotoxicology), but we also consider candidates from other related scientific fields.
* Experience with experimental field and laboratory skills and (aquatic) organism identifications are highly valued
* Strong background and interest in statistical analyses, data management, visualization and coding skills (in R, but Python also applies) is highly valued.
* You must be proficient in spoken and written English.
* You are a team player and have a collaborative attitude.


**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,800 staff and almost 6,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 150 FTE (including postdocs and PhD candidates) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

We offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 4 years based on performance. Salary ranges from € 2.770 gross per month in the first year to € 3.539 gross per month in the fourth year based on a full-time position (pay scale P in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities).


Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development and sabbatical leave. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break.


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all.

DGOA is een landelijke kwaliteitsregistratie voor patiënten met de vier meest voorkomende gynaecologische kankers: Baarmoederkanker, Eierstokkanker, Baarmoederhalskanker en Schaamlipkanker. De kwaliteitsregistratie heeft als doel om de kwaliteit van zorg voor deze patiëntengroepen in alle Nederlandse ziekenhuizen inzichtelijk te maken en te verbeteren. Daarnaast heeft DGOA tot doel om wetenschappelijk onderzoek uit te voeren met *real world data*. Dit draagt bij aan transparantie in zorgkwaliteit voor diverse landelijke stakeholders.

De kwaliteitsregistratie DICA Gynaecologische oncologie is onderdeel van DICA. Bij DICA verzamelen wij met onze 26 kwaliteitsregistraties data over patiënten, behandelingen en complicaties.

Wil jij meedenken en bouwen aan nieuwe IT-faciliteiten en software die onze statistische processen gereed maken voor de toekomst? Ben jij de teamspeler die applicaties bouwt waar gebruikers blij van worden?  

Maak het verschil en solliciteer.


  
jouw uitdaging


Onze onderzoekers kunnen hulp gebruiken bij het automatiseren van hun statistische processen. De huidige applicaties zijn aan herontwikkeling en/of uitbreiding toe.  

Voor de herontwikkeling maken wij de overstap naar Python en R en naar meer generieke systemen. Ook willen we het gebruik van databases stimuleren. Je werkt in een multidisciplinair team waarbij je kennis deelt en opdoet.
  

Als developer ben je een allrounder en houd je van diversiteit en afwisseling in je werk. Omdat het team klein is ben je bij alle facetten van de applicatieontwikkeling betrokken. Van het nadenken over een geschikte architectuur en het maken van geautomtiseerde testen tot het overleg met gebruikers over de gewenste functionaliteit en het visualiseren van gegevens, zodat inhoudelijk experts controles snel en eenvoudig uit kunnen voeren.  

Je werk bestaat uit:


* Het (her)ontwerpen, bouwen en testen van packages en (maatwerk)systemen in Python en R, en het vertalen van klantwensen en ideeën van (eind)gebruikers in softwareontwerpen en herbruikbare applicaties.
* Inzetten van je professionele kennis en ervaring aan collega’s binnen het CBS, optreden als een vraagbaak en coach op het gebied van Python, R en SQL, en meedenken over de IT-faciliteiten voor Data Scientists en Statistisch Onderzoekers.
* Optreden als sparringpartner voor de business, waarbij je met de juiste vragen toegevoegde waarde levert om tot een nog beter product te komen.
* Actief bijdragen aan een professionele werkomgeving door je kennis en ervaring te delen en te ondersteunen bij de ontwikkeling van IT-oplossingen.
Dit is je team


Activiteit


In de lunchpauzes maken we meestal een gezellige wandeling.
Blijven leren


We stimuleren medewerkers zich verder te ontplooien. Trainingen kun je volgen via de CBS Academy of via e-learning.
Medewerkers


Het team bestaat momenteel uit 3 medewerkers.
Samenwerking


Je zet je expertise breed in binnen de sector Leefomgeving en werkt samen met ontwikkelaars uit de verschillende teams.
Je komt te werken in een klein team, dat zoveel mogelijk de agile werkwijze volgt en de verschillende inhoudelijke teams helpt op het gebied van applicatieontwikkeling. Je werkt in projecten van ongeveer 9 maanden steeds weer aan een andere applicatie. We beheren de applicaties niet zelf.  

Je komt te werken bij de sector Leefomgeving, waar productie plaatsvindt van statistieken op het gebied van de woningmarkt, energie, natuur, milieu en ruimtelijke statistieken. De CBS-statistieken staan in grote belangstelling bij onder meer de Europese Commissie, onderzoeksorganisates, planbureaus, de ministeries en nationale- en internationale media.  

Maatschappelijke en technologische ontwikkelingen dagen ons uit om te blijven vernieuwen en ontwikkelen. Om toonaangevend te blijven is het CBS bezig statistische processen opnieuw in te richten.
Dit ben jij


* Hbo denk- en werkniveau.
* Je hebt ervaring met het verwerken van data in Python of R.
* Je hebt ervaring met database architectuur.
* Ervaring met GIT, ArcGIS of andere GIS-software zijn een pré.
Dit kun je van ons verwachten


Voor onze arbeidsvoorwaarden volgen wij de CAO Rijk.  

Dat betekent dat je onder andere kunt rekenen op het volgende:


* Een salaris van minimaal EUR 3404,- en maximaal EUR 6110,- bruto per maand op basis van 36 uur. Afhankelijk van je kennis en ervaring.
* 8% vakantiegeld en een 13e maand. In totaal is dit 16,5% bovenop je salaris. Dit noemen wij het Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB). Je bepaalt zelf hoe, wanneer en op welke manier je dit budget wilt inzetten.
* Pensioenopbouw bij het ABP Pensioenfonds.
* Een laptop (Microsoft of Apple) en mobiele telefoon (Android of iOS).
* Twee tot drie dagen thuiswerken, de rest ben je aanwezig in ons onlangs gerenoveerde gebouw. In je team maak je daar verder afspraken over.

Bij ESDN bouw je aan een centraal IT-landschap voor de hele energiemarkt. Sámen met onze partners. Met behulp van jouw oplossingen voor complexe problemen zetten we een grote stap voorwaarts in het neerzetten van toekomstbestendige en betrouwbare systemen. We hebben flinke ambities en daarom zijn wij op zoek naar jou!


**Werk op het snijvlak van energie, data en IT**
------------------------------------------------

  

#### **Werk vol energie**

  

Een business analist bij EDSN heeft een divers takenpakket als bruggenbouwer tussen de business, data en ICT. Van jou wordt verwacht dat je zelfstandig optreedt en een brede scope hanteert. Als business analist ben je verantwoordelijk voor het voorzien, onderkennen en vertalen van de business behoeftes naar bruikbare oplossingen. Het invoeren van die oplossingen hoort daar ook bij natuurlijk. Nieuwe ontwikkelingen in de markt oppikken en vertalen naar efficiënte oplossingen is iets waardoor jij onmisbaar bent. Samen met je (product) team werk je middels de SAFe methodiek. Onze Agile werkwijze is kenmerkend hoe we wendbaar blijven om waardevolle (data)producten te ontwikkelen


Als Business Analist word je (ook) onderdeel van onze Business Analist Community of Practice. In deze vakgroep met gelijkgestemden werk je samen met collega's/vakgenoten aan relevante thema's t.b.v. professionalisering van het domein business analyse.

* Je maakt de business- en informatiebehoefte van gebruikers inzichtelijk en vertaalt die in business processen, business eisen en functionele eisen voor dataproducten doormiddel van feature refinement
* Je werkt samen met en ondersteunt de Product Manager en Solution Architect bij refinement van business behoeften en backlog refinement
* Je stelt zelfstandig het ontwerp van complexe oplossingen en dienstverlening op
* Je verduidelijkt (nieuwe) business processen op basis van klantvragen
* Je zorgt voor aansluiting van de business processen op wet- en regelgeving
* Je zorgt samen met de Product Manager voor een overdracht van je features naar scrumteam(s) en je ondersteunt de teams (met o.a. data engineers en analisten) in het helder krijgen van de business behoefte en daarbij passende dataproducten
* Je draagt bij aan het up-to-date houden van de functionele documentatie

**Combineren van databronnen**
------------------------------

EDSN faciliteert de ontwikkeling van een gestandaardiseerd en gedigitaliseerd data ecosysteem voor de energiesector. In de nieuwe waardestroom Data & Analytics werken we aan de ontwikkeling van dataproducten. Denk daarbij aan inzichten en visualisaties van verbruik, energie allocatie, en congestie. De afnemers van dataproducten zijn divers: we faciliteren marktprocessen van netbeheerders, handelen maatwerk dataverzoeken af voor marktpartijen en stellen data beschikbaar op publieke portalen. We ontwikkelen steeds meer en steeds complexere dataproducten; waarbij we altijd werken binnen de kaders van de AVG. De dataproducten die worden gemaakt zijn voornamelijk rapportages, datadiensten en geavanceerde queries.


Voor de uitwisseling van informatie bedienen we diverse klantgroepen en diverse portalen. Waarde, compliance en efficiëntie staan daarbij hoog in het vaandel.  



  

#### **Samenwerken en kennis delen**

  

#### **Hier krijg je energie van**

Het geeft je energie om vanuit een brede scope naar zaken te kijken. De vrijheid die je hierin krijgt, past jou helemaal. Door jouw analyserend vermogen is het brede perspectief helemaal in kaart. Je weet hoe het is om alle stakeholders mee te nemen en diverse invalshoeken te belichten. Jouw werkwijze is overwogen en doeltreffend. Met jouw overtuigingskracht weet jij jouw visie over te brengen op anderen en hen hierin mee te nemen. Je hebt brede kennis van zowel de business als ICT en weet waar die twee elkaar raken en versterken.  



  

#### **Dit neem verder je mee**


* HBO/WO werk en denkniveau in een bedrijfskundige/ICT richting
* Minimaal 5 jaar werkervaring als business analist

-------------------


  
*Wil jij, met een bedrijfskundige blik, meedenken over de doorontwikkeling van onze dienstverlening binnen de justitiële strafrecht-, migratie- en jeugdketen? Dit zodat onze informatie(systemen) voldoen aan (nieuwe) wet- en regelgeving en ook zodat eindgebruikers nog makkelijker/beter met onze informatie kunnen werken? Lees dan verder.*


**WAT GA JE DOEN?**



Als Productspecialist, zoals de functie bij ons heet, zorg je voor een optimale werking en positionering van onze dienstverlening (informatieproducten en diensten) in de strafrecht- migratie en jeugdketen. Je bent een inhoudelijk specialist en vooral de belangenbehartiger van het betreffende product/dienst voor interne en externe stakeholders. Jij bent dus cruciaal in het verbinden van alle interne en externe betrokkenen.



Je verbindt het interne werkproces aan andere interne en externe (keten) processen en onderhoudt contacten met de relevante ketenpartner(s). Ook signaleer je (toekomstige) ontwikkelingen in wetgeving, (inter)nationale richtlijnen, beleid, werkprocessen en ‘klantbehoeften’ en anticipeert hierop door een vertaalslag te maken naar adviezen, plannen, beleid en uitvoeringsrichtlijnen.



Voorbeelden van informatieproducten op onze afdeling zijn: het Nederlands uittreksel (ook wel bekend als strafblad), uittreksel European Criminal Record Information Services (ECRIS uittreksel), Justitieel PersoonsDossier. Om je een idee te geven van ons werk; we verstrekten in 2023 ruim 7.096.000 uittreksels strafbladen en 39.200 ECRIS uittreksels.
  

Jouw aandachtsgebied zal vooral ‘Ecris’ en ‘zakenstromen’ zijn.



Concreet betekent dat:


* Je volgt en analyseert relevante (ook internationale) ontwikkelingen, wetgeving en ketenpartners, ketenprocessen, richtlijnen en werkprocessen, neem je mee in je overwegingen.
* Door het netwerken met ketenpartners en gebruikers, vooral op tactisch niveau, breng je verschillende invalshoeken in kaart en weet je de wettelijke en maatschappelijke taak van Justid juist te positioneren binnen de processen van de keten. Ook kun je betrokken in- en externe partijen begeleiden en adviseren bij de interpretatie en uitvoering van de richtlijnen.
* Voorlichting/opleiding geven over het product/dienst en promoten, bewustzijn creëren.
* Expertise (van verschillende disciplines) inbrengen in (keten)programma’s en projecten, werkgroepen en overleggen en daar de doelstellingen en belangen van Justid (wettelijke en maatschappelijke taken) in meenemen.
* Je denkt mee over afdelingsplannen en –rapportages vanuit jouw inhoudelijke kennis van het product/de dienst en de omgeving.


Let op als je gaat solliciteren. Wij stellen een aantal vragen om je beter te leren kennen. Je hoeft dus geen sollicitatiebrief te schrijven.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
Je bent een netwerker pur sang met een goede organisatiesensitiviteit. Samen met accountmanagement en informatiemanagement weet je de contacten ook uit te breiden.
  

Je bent echter ook van het doen. Met jouw analyserende kwaliteiten in combinatie met een innoverende aard weet je een resultaat te behalen waar de eindklant blij mee is.
  

Daarbij realiseer je je, dat besluitvormingsprocessen bij de overheid niet altijd zo snel gaan, als je zou willen. Door jouw overtuigingskracht weet je onderwerpen echter wel op tafel te krijgen. Dit komt dan ook vooral door jouw bovengemiddelde communicatie- en adviesvaardigheden. Die heb je ook nodig omdat jij de schakel bent tussen de wens van de klant en de uitvoering en/of ontwikkelteams. Met beide “partijen” kun je dan ook op niveau communiceren. Omdat je altijd met veel dingen tegelijk bezig bent kun je goed overzicht houden. En daarbij is dan Nee zeggen zonder de relatie te beschadigen ook een kwaliteit die goed van pas komt.



Wat lezen we op jouw CV?


* Je bent vaardig in het vertalen van ontwikkelingen/visie naar uitvoering.
* Je bent in staat om vanuit een business perspectief te kijken naar productontwikkeling binnen de justitiële ketens en hebt hiervoor ook een aantoonbare interesse in IT (software ontwikkeling).
* Je beschikt over uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden, zowel schriftelijk als mondeling in het Nederlands en het Engels.
* Je hebt een WO werk- en denkniveau.
* Bij voorkeur heb je al contacten in de strafrecht- migratie- en jeugdketen en daar netwerken is waar je blij van wordt.
* Kennis van onze informatievoorziening binnen de strafrechtsketen is een pré.
* Een affiniteit met privacy en security

Ook kun je dit budget omzetten in verlof en andersom of besteden aan fiscaal vriendelijke doelen. De Rijksoverheid hecht sterk aan persoonlijke groei en loopbaanontwikkeling en biedt daarvoor tal van mogelijkheden. Tot de secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden behoren onder meer verschillende studiefaciliteiten, bedrijfsfitness, volledige vergoeding van je OV-reiskosten woon-werkverkeer en gedeeltelijk betaald ouderschapsverlof.

Met onze ruim 500 professionals in Almelo, Zutphen, Leeuwarden en Den Haag, werken we aan producten met innovatieve tools en technieken, vanuit deskundigheid en vakmanschap. Zo is ons voortbrengingsproces agile ingericht en werken we continue aan verbetering van onze producten en diensten.

Justid is een informele organisatie met korte lijnen naar leidinggevenden en directie. Kom je bij ons werken, verwacht dan ook een fijne sociale en informele werksfeer! Een goede werk-privébalans is wat ons betreft erg belangrijk. Daarom werken we hybride. Als netwerkorganisatie zijn er uiteraard voldoende mogelijkheden om jouw collega’s beter te leren kennen. Zo worden er geregeld team- en afdelingsuitjes georganiseerd en kijken we jaarlijks uit naar de zomer- en kerstborrel. Als jij geniet van grote hoeveelheden data en innovatieve IT-technieken en vraagstukken en dit wil combineren met een relaxte werksfeer, dan kom je hier zeker tot je recht.



Op onze website lees je meer informatie over wie we zijn en ook ervaringsverhalen van collega's. Als je meer wilt weten over onze producten en diensten dan kun je dat lezen in onze Producten- en diensten catalogus.

**Zo ziet jouw baan eruit**
---------------------------

 *De verbindende factor tussen business en IT: dat ben jij als Business Analist bij de Volksbank. Vanuit Utrecht en je thuiswerkplek zet je je samen met leuke collega’s in voor de verdere ontwikkeling van onze applicaties.*  

  

Denk hierbij aan onze chat, chatbot, e-mail, telefonie en andere klantcontact applicaties. Deze applicaties zijn beschikbaar voor al onze vier merken – ASN Bank, SNS, RegioBank en BLG Wonen.  

  

Jouw kracht ligt in het analyseren en opstellen van requirements voor onze klantcontact applicaties en daarbij denk je vanuit de klanten. Om hun wensen en behoeften duidelijk in beeld te brengen en epics uit te werken, haal je input op bij je business collega’s zodat de klantbeleving verder verbetert. De afstemming met verschillende collega’s in de organisatie maakt jouw rol heel divers. Specifiek ga je in het begin aan de slag met een nieuwe oplossing voor ons telefonieplatform, waarvoor we momenteel opzoek zijn naar een nieuw en innovatief platform voor ons klantcontactcenter. Als Business Analist ga jij aan de slag met requirements ophalen en borgen dat het cloud platform voor telefonie voldoet aan deze eisen.
  

  

Je houdt je bezig met vragen als: wat is precies de wens van de klant? Welke requirements hebben onze medewerkers en moeten we meenemen bij een nieuwe tool of leveranciers selectie? Welke richtlijnen zijn er vanuit architectuur en welke wetgeving is relevant? Je zorgt voor een functionele beschrijving (story) met technische aanwijzingen. Jouw stories zijn input voor de development engineers in je team. Tijdens de realisatie van de story blijf je betrokken, onder andere door de oplossing te testen.  

  

Door het uitwerken van de requirements, impactanalyses en oplossingsrichtingen creëer je waarde voor de klant en ondersteun en adviseer je ons team. Je bent een echte sparringpartner en linking pin, juist omdat je de taal spreekt van zowel business als IT. Op basis van je analyses en de requirements begeleid je ook de refinement-sessies van je team.  

  

Hier kom je te werken  

Met zo’n tien IT- en businesscollega’s werk je in het scrum team omnichannel klantcontact binnen de Klant interfaces hub. Het team bestaat uit twee sub teams. Het ene team is vooral bezig met behoeftes vanuit de klant, en het andere deel kijkt vooral hoe we de medewerker zo goed mogelijk kunnen ondersteunen. Je werkt voor alle twee de sub teams. Dit team, waarin iedereen voor elkaar klaar staat, kan naast jou bestaan uit developers, een UX designer, een Tester, een Scrum Master en Product Owner. Samen met je teamgenoten spreek je af op welke locatie jullie bij elkaar komen. Meestal zien we elkaar één keer in de week, maar we zijn sowieso met sprintwissel-dag op woensdag op kantoor in Utrecht. Wil je vaker op kantoor zijn, dan is dat ook prima er zit altijd wel een kleine delegatie van het team. Eens in de twee weken kom je ook samen met andere Business Analisten inzichten te delen en van elkaar te leren.  

  

Jouw kwaliteiten  

Goed luisteren, doorvragen en de impact analyseren. Dat kun jij als geen ander. Zo achterhaal je precies wat er bij gebruikers leeft en wat de wensen en mogelijkheden zijn. Van helikopterview tot op detailniveau ben je er goed in om informatie nauwkeurig te structureren, overzicht te houden en je werk te prioriteren. Je zoekt proactief de verbinding met anderen op en vindt snel de juiste mensen, ook buiten je eigen team. Door je nieuwsgierigheid kom je steeds weer met creatieve oplossingen, waarbij je data en digitale mogelijkheden slim benut. Zo blijf je leren, worden de resultaten van het team beter en groeit de organisatie. Uit de nauwe samenwerking met je directe collega’s haal je energie.  

  

Verder heb je:

* Hbo werk en denk niveau.
* Ervaring in vergelijkbare rollen zoals Business Analist, Informatieanalist, of Requirements Engineer binnen een agile werkomgeving;
* Ervaring met het opstellen van user stories en technische requirements;
* Kennis van klantcontact centra en specifiek Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS);
* Ervaring met migratie van een onprem telefonie platform naar een ccaas is een pre.


Wat krijg je van ons?


Het salaris voor deze functie ligt tussen de € 4739,11,- en € 6.318,81 bruto per maand op basis van 36 uur per week.

* Een 36-urige werkweek, flexibel in te delen met bijvoorbeeld 4x9 uur per week (32 uur per week is bespreekbaar);
* Een individueel keuzebudget (IKB), waarmee je zelf kiest wanneer je jouw vakantiegeld en dertiende maand ontvangt;
* Een goede collectieve pensioenregeling, met een inleg van de Volksbank van 22,5% van de salarissen;
* 208,8 verlofuren per jaar o.b.v. fulltime dienstverband, ongeacht je leef
* Thuiswerken is bij ons heel normaal; Een thuiswerkvergoeding van 40 euro netto per maand en iedere 5 jaar een budget van 900 euro om jouw thuiswerkplek in te richten;
* Een persoonlijk opleidingsbudget van 750 euro per jaar, naast de standaard opleidingsmogelijkheden;
* Een NS-Business Card én een kilometervergoeding als je naar werk fietst;
* Een fietsplan om voordelig eenmalig een fiets aan te schaffen;
* 2 dagen per jaar krijg je doorbetaald bij vrijwilligerswerk;
* Een vitaliteitsprogramma met workshops en coaching voor jouw mentale en fysieke gezondheid;
* Een laptop en telefoon.


Word jij onze nieuwe collega?  

We nodigen je van harte uit om te solliciteren. En alvast één gouden tip: wees jezelf. Wij omarmen de diversiteit van al onze collega’s en zijn oprecht benieuwd naar jou.

-------------------


  
In de rol van onderzoeker/data-analist bij Zicht op Ondermijning lever je een belangrijke bijdrage aan een weerbaar bestuur. Door onderzoek te doen naar de aanwezigheid van fenomenen die mogelijk duiden op de aanwezigheid van crimineel ondermijnend gedrag, draag je bij aan het versterken van de informatiepositie van lokale overheden (o.a. gemeenten). Je werkzaamheden beginnen met het in kaart brengen van de informatiebehoefte van de lokale overheden en het formuleren van een passende onderzoeksvraag. Deze onderzoeksvraag beantwoord je met behulp van relevante CBS-data en eventueel externe data bronnen. Een voorbeeld van een analyse waar je aan zou kunnen gaan werken is het in kaart brengen van gebieden met een hoog aandeel bedrijven die betrokken waren bij verdachte transacties. Hiervoor gebruiken we zowel externe data over verdachte transacties (FIU) als een groot aantal door het CBS beschikbaar gestelde bestanden met informatie over bedrijven en eigenaren en bestuurders van bedrijven. Het doel van deze analyse is om lokale overheden te laten zien welke mogelijke risico’s op het gebied van witwassen er binnen jouw gemeente zijn.


De analyses vinden plaats in een beveiligde analyseomgeving van het CBS. Je doet onderzoek naar het fenomeen, verzamelt, structureert en controleert data (o.b.v. het vier-ogen principe) en past verschillende analysemethoden, waaronder beschrijvende statistiek en datascience-technieken toe. Je verwerkt de verkregen data en zet deze om tot begrijpbare informatie ten behoeve van validatie en visualisatie op het dashboard van Zicht op Ondermijning (www.zichtopondermijning.nl). Je maakt rapportages en presentaties ter review aan projectleiders, collega-onderzoekers/data-analisten en (domein)experts. Naast dat je datamodellen creëert en advies geeft over de verkregen informatie, denk je ook mee over het meer informatiegestuurd ontwikkelen van beleid binnen de directie Democratie en Bestuur van het ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties

Je bent een onderzoeker/data-analist, hebt affiniteit met cijfers en data, en hebt een brede kennis van benodigde software, programmeertalen (R vereist) en analysemethodes. Je vindt het leuk om met in- en externen te schakelen en te communiceren. Je beschikt over presentatievaardigheden en het vermogen om ingewikkelde informatie op een begrijpelijke manier uit te leggen. Jouw analytisch en probleemoplossend denkvermogen koppel je aan nauwkeurigheid en oog voor detail. Je bent proactief en initiatiefrijk, en je draagt creatieve ideeën aan voor de verzameling of analyse van data.


Dit ben jij:

* Je hebt minimaal 2/3 jaar werkervaring (eis) in gerelateerd gebied.
* Je bent een enthousiaste onderzoeker met wo werk- en denkniveau.

Directie Democratie en Bestuur

We werken aan versterking van de band tussen kiezers en gekozenen, een betere toerusting en ondersteuning van politieke ambtsdragers en een weerbaar effectief bestuur. Als directie hebben we een brede sociaal-maatschappelijke oriëntatie en dragen bij aan de oplossing van spanningen, dilemma’s en actuele vraagstukken op het snijvlak van politiek, bestuur en samenleving. De directie bestaat uit vier afdelingen; Democratie, Inrichting Openbaar Bestuur, Ondersteuning Bestuur en Politieke Ambtsdragers en Weerbaarheid, met daarbinnen onder andere het programma Slavernijverleden en het Nationaal Programma Leefbaarheid en Veiligheid.

Afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur  

De nieuwe afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur levert een bijdrage aan de uitvoering van de missie en visie van de directie D&B, onder meer door de informatiepositie van het decentraal bestuur op complexe opgaven te vergroten en op projectmatige wijze (uitvoerings)beleid en werkvormen te ontwikkelen die goed verbonden zijn met de praktijk van het decentraal bestuur. Op korte termijn is de opgave van de afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur om de methodiek van Zicht op Ondermijning structureel te borgen. De afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur is verantwoordelijk voor de kwaliteit van de 'Zicht op-methode' en het organiseren, uitbreiden en onderhouden van het brede samenwerkingsverband en het maken van afspraken met interne en externe netwerkpartners.  

Om de meerwaarde van de 'Zicht-op methode' voor bredere inzet binnen het decentraal bestuur te vergroten werkt de afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur aan bewustwording rond (ondermijnings)risico's; versterking van de informatiepositie van decentraal bestuur (o.a. via de Zicht-op methode); het aanreiken van handelingsperspectief; het ontwikkelen van een kennis en leernetwerk en expertpool; ontwikkeling van monitoring en rapportage en onderzoek ten behoeve van de bestuurlijk-preventieve aanpak vanuit het decentraal bestuur.



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.

**Who you are**  

  

You are curious and you love tinkering. You believe together is better than apart. You have opinions, but you are happy to change your mind if new data contradicts the assumptions. You love leading by example and you get energy when those around you succeed through your efforts. You believe in finding a solution actively rather than passively waiting for the solution to come to you. You are always constantly on the lookout for new ways to improve the system, the processes, or the team. The IKEA values resonate with you.  

  

Regardless of whether you have had advanced education in computer science or if you have learned software engineering through other means, you keep up to date on current best practices. You are unafraid to question your own assumptions about the world and have a track record of flexibility and end-to-end ownership of systems, from the customer to the database. You are deliberate in the software you deliver and focus on well-functioning software ecosystems, democratic data, smart infrastructure, and resiliency.  

  

The IKEA culture and values are the core of our business and day-to-day work life. For you to thrive and grow with IKEA it is important for us that you share our values!

**Your responsibilities**  

  

Within the omnichannel planning sub-domain, together with you, we build and maintain systems that give our planners across functions the digital tools to support them in their planning journey. This is at the heart of IKEA: to be efficient at selling things, offer the best price and cover the customer needs in terms of delivery and other services.
  

  

We need to innovate in the planning area. We need to know how and where to allocate and store our stock, how our supply chain network can handle the customer demand and what tweaks or business decisions we need to make to cover our customer needs and business goals in a new digital world. We will support the organisation and our customers by providing a user-friendly experience to our co-workers, enabling them to collaborate across different functions and provide world-class automation and analytics.

* Creating reactive and visually rich UIs with JavaScript/Typescript and React

  

* Generating data insights, analytics and machine learning models mostly with Python.

  

* Building and maintaining microservices (containerized workloads, distributed systems, container orchestration) on public and/or private cloud environments.

  

* Managing and maintaining data ingestion pipelines and tools to enable our machine learning and data science colleagues to build forecasting and optimisation capabilities for our product.

  

* Following the dev-ops way of working: You write it, you run it, you own it.

  

* Taking initiative to experiment, prototype new ideas, not be afraid to fail, re-iterate and generate value.

  

* Applying and adhering to good software engineering practices such as continuous integration, automated tests, pair programming, and code reviews.

  

* Collaborating in an agile/iterative cross-functional development environment.

  

* Providing support and guidance as needed to other developers within or outside our product teams

  

* Encouraging good practices as well as creating an environment based on psychological safety.

  

* Working closely together with other software engineers and cross functions to produce all required designs and ensure that digital solutions work together, fulfilling business needs.

  

**About this work area**  

  

At Group Digital, we set the digital agenda to keep IKEA leading in an ever-evolving and fast-moving environment. We drive the development, provision and operation of our digital products and services through the use of new and existing technology and agile delivery methods to deliver at pace. At the same time, we provide a home for digital skills to both develop and extend the technical, people and business skills needed to ensure continuous development and growth of our digital capability.  

  

WHY YOU SHOULD JOIN IKEA  

  

At IKEA we strongly believe that we can help people and the planet while creating an affordable and better everyday life at home.  

  

We believe that it is our responsibility together to find a greater purpose and create space to innovate. We believe that innovation comes from daring to fail; these stories inspire us to explore and dare to try again.  

  

We believe that we thrive when meeting incredible people who are on the same mission at IKEA. People who are very humble, supportive, and committed to leading into the future and creating a better life for more of the many people by putting the customer and their homes at the heart of all we do.

Het NCSC werkt aan een digitaal veilig Nederland. Door het tempo waarin het cybersecuritydomein zich ontwikkelt en de rol van het NCSC daarin, ligt er een flinke uitdaging voor de toekomst. Het is voor ons als hét kennisinstituut van cybersecurity in Nederland essentieel dat wij Nederland van kwalitatief hoogwaardige en actuele informatie voorzien, in crisistijd en daarbuiten. Deze kennis en kunde halen wij mede uit en delen wij ook weer met ons netwerk (overheden, bedrijfsleven en andere nationale en internationale partners). Op deze wijze proberen we tijdig in te springen op nieuw ontdekte kwetsbaarheden, aanvalscampagnes en ernstige ICT-verstoringen om deze te voorkomen en op te lossen. Als het toch misgaat beperken we op deze manier de impact.

Wat ga je doen?



Als System Integrator draag je T-shaped bij aan het implementeren, integreren en beheer van (maatwerk) producten en diensten van NCSC. Jij hebt op één discipline diepgaande kennis (op System Integration) en op een tweede en derde discipline kan je ook goed werkzaamheden oppakken, bijvoorbeeld op gebied van Systeem Beheer of Monitoring.  

Een System Integrator verbindt technologieën en softwareapplicaties, in-house ontwikkeld of afkomstig van diverse externe partijen, op een consistente functionele manier, zodat er een samenhangende en goed werkende infrastructuur ontstaat.



Voorbeelden van integratiewerkzaamheden: oppakken van technische issues bij het invoeren van een nieuwe dienst, zoals bijvoorbeeld het realiseren van connectiviteit voor MijnNCSC Portaal, aanpassen van configuraties, database gerelateerde aanpassingen, verder het bedenken en implementeren van (aangepaste) configuraties voor bijv. loadbalancers, routers, firewalls, monitoringsystemen enz., een controle en functioneel gebruik van beschikbare API’s, kleine aanpassingen en fixes in source code om een service werkend te krijgen, in het algemeen dus het (functioneel) aansluiten en configureren van nieuwe diensten en/of systemen in een bestaande infrastructuur. Concrete voorbeelden van afgelopen jaar zijn: configuratie en integratie van de vulnerabilityscanners IQ-Server en Sonarqube, functioneel aanpassen (oude) API Gateway, integratie Keycloak met Federatieve Service ACC en PRD, DMS integratie, en alle migraties naar en integraties met de nieuwe K8S omgeving.



Taken en verantwoordelijkheden:


* Implementeren en integreren van nieuwe systemen en applicaties zodat diensten functioneel blijven aansluiten bij de wensen van de business.
* Beheer kritieke producten en diensten zoals het MijnNCSC Portaal; borgen dat diensten blijvend voldoen aan de hoogste eisen op gebied van security (BBN3), beschikbaarheid en performance.
* Een Piketdienst wordt naar verwachting onderdeel van de functie.
* De werksfeer is informeel en er wordt veel ruimte voor eigen initiatief geboden. In tweewekelijkse sprints dragen we als team bij aan de missie van NCSC. Iedereen is elke dag welkom, maar als team zijn we 1 dag per week op kantoor.

Het NCSC werkt aan een digitaal veilig Nederland. Door het tempo waarin het cybersecuritydomein zich ontwikkelt en de rol van het NCSC daarin, ligt er een flinke uitdaging voor de toekomst. Het is voor ons als hét kennisinstituut van cybersecurity in Nederland essentieel dat wij Nederland van kwalitatief hoogwaardige en actuele informatie voorzien, in crisistijd en daarbuiten. Deze kennis en kunde halen wij mede uit en delen wij ook weer met ons netwerk (overheden, bedrijfsleven en andere nationale en internationale partners). Op deze wijze proberen we tijdig in te springen op nieuw ontdekte kwetsbaarheden, aanvalscampagnes en ernstige ICT-verstoringen om deze te voorkomen en op te lossen. Als het toch misgaat beperken we op deze manier de impact.

At PostNL, our business unit “Cross Border Solutions” (CBS) makes it easy for people and businesses to communicate and trade across international boundaries. CBS aims to become the most respected service provider by supporting the cross-border e-commerce market through creative and innovative distribution solutions.

**Freedom:** You will work from home and in a flexible workplace in our vibrant, modern office in the historic Stationspostgebouw (next to Holland Spoor station).  

**Development opportunities:** You will be given plenty of opportunities to follow training courses and grow into other positions or departments. Besides working on a central project, you will also have the chance to contribute to various other activities in our end-to-end team of data analysts and engineers, and leave your mark with improvement ideas on all areas of our daily work.  

  

**Wat breng jij mee?**  


With your analytical skills and curiosity, you know how to convert complex data into useful insights. You also have a keen eye and fresh perspective for continuously improving our way of working. With your 'can do' mentality, you connect the different teams in the data flow from source to dashboard to speed up the generation of insights for all the important business decisions we make every day, based on reliable data. You are able to independently tackle various human and organizational issues, from data collection to managing of expectations.

Infrastructure Specialists at Kyndryl are project-based subject matter experts in all things infrastructure – good at providing analysis, documenting and diagraming work for hand-off, offering timely solutions, and generally “figuring it out.” This is a hands-on role where your feel for the interaction between a system and its environment will be invaluable to every one of your clients.  

  

There are two halves to this role: First, contributing to current projects where you analyze problems and tech issues, offer solutions, and test, modify, automate, and integrate systems. And second, long-range strategic planning of IT infrastructure and operational execution. This role isn’t specific to any one platform, so you’ll need a good feel for all of them. And because of this, you’ll experience variety and growth at Kyndryl that you won’t find anywhere else.  

  

You’ll be involved early to offer solutions, help decide whether something can be done, and identify the technical and timeline risks up front. This means dealing with both client expectations and internal challenges – in other words, there are plenty of opportunities to make a difference, and a lot of people will witness your contributions. In fact, a frequent sign of success for our Infrastructure Specialists is when clients come back to us and ask for the same person by name. That’s the kind of impact you can have!  

  

This is a project-based role where you’ll enjoy deep involvement throughout the lifespan of a project, as well as the chance to work closely with Architects, Technicians, and PMs. Whatever your current level of tech savvy or where you want your career to lead, you’ll find the right opportunities and a buddy to support your growth. Boredom? Trust us, that won’t be an issue.  

  

Your future at Kyndryl  

There are lots of opportunities to gain certification and qualifications on the job, and you’ll continuously grow as a Cloud Hyperscaler. Many of our Infrastructure Specialists are on a path toward becoming either an Architect or Distinguished Engineer, and there are opportunities at every skill level to grow in either of these directions.  

Who You Are
You’re good at what you do and possess the required experience to prove it. However, equally as important – you have a growth mindset; keen to drive your own personal and professional development. You are customer-focused – someone who prioritizes customer success in their work. And finally, you’re open and borderless – naturally inclusive in how you work with others.  

  

Required Technical and Professional Experience  

  

* Deep expertise within specific technology domain areas (e.g., software development, cloud computing, systems engineering, infrastructure, security, networking, data & analytics) with a minimum of 4 years of experience.
* Enterprise IT application experience
* Hands-on experience in at least one of the following: software development, DevOps engineering, systems administration, or systems architecture in public cloud AWS domain
* In-depth knowledge of Windows and Linux Operating Systems
* Must have experience driving for engineering solutions and working across teams
* Extensive experience and judgment to plan and accomplish goals
* Ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce conclusions and responses.
* Ability to communicate effectively, both verbal and written
* Strong process improvement experience

  

Preferred Technical and Professional Experience  

  

* In depth knowledge of Amazon cloud hosting architecture with experience with AWS and Azure is a bonus
* Exceptional judgment and decision-making abilities
* Familiar with a variety of IT concepts, practices, and procedures
* Knowledge of design techniques, tools, and principals involved in production of precision technical plans, blueprints, drawings, and models
* Logic and reasoning to identify the strengths and weaknesses of alternative solutions, conclusions, or approaches to problems
* Strong analytical and problem-solving skills with high attention to detail

De opleiding


De opleiding Applied Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (ADS&AI) is voor studenten die begrijpen dat, naast technische en niet-technische competenties, de ontwikkelde AI oplossingen ook een verantwoordelijkheid met zich meebrengen (responsible AI).


We staan als opleiding voor een open en respectvolle leeromgeving en vinden het belangrijk dat onze studenten met plezier en vertrouwen hun studie volgen. Er is gekozen voor een geïntegreerd onderwijsconcept waarbij de ontwikkelingsgerichtheid van de student centraal staat. Dat betekent dat de student gericht wordt opgeleid aan de hand van onze zes competenties (responsible technology, drie technische competenties en twee professionele competenties). Studenten ontvangen regelmatig feedback en mogen fouten maken. Vertrouwen opbouwen in hun eigen kunnen is iets wat we de studenten mee willen geven.


We leren studenten om oplossingen en toepassingen voor uiteenlopende stakeholders te onderzoeken, te ontwerpen en te bouwen. De studenten worden niet alleen technisch goed onderlegd, ze leren ook te adviseren en communiceren over inzichten en oplossingen. Het onderwijs richt zich voornamelijk op projecten waarbij we zo dicht mogelijk de praktijk proberen te benaderen. Dit doen we in het 1e studiejaar aan de hand van vier thema’s: data driven society, smart & social city, data driven logistics en data supported healthcare. Er wordt vooral met echte opdrachtgevers gewerkt.

Do you want to set up and run a clinical trial to discover how non-nutritive sweeteners affect physiology, metabolism and the microbiome? Are you a nutrition scientist with a keen interest in optimizing foods and diets for health, without compromising taste? Would you like to conduct research that can make an impact on food reformulation and public health? Then this vacancy may be of interest to you.***  

  

The division of Human Nutrition and Health has an opening to conduct research on the impact of non-nutrive sweeteners on physiology, metabolism and the microbiome. As a PhD student you will be managing a controlled dietary intervention trial within the Human Research Unit of the Division of Human Nutrition and Health, analyse the data and write peer reviewed papers on the outcomes of the trial.  

The work is part of a larger PPS project funded by TKI and private partners on non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS). NNS are commonly integrated into products and presumed to be inert. However, recent evidence suggests that supplementation of specific NNS may induce person-specific, microbiome-dependent glycemic alterations. Although recent studies provoke considerable debate, the precise implications of these effects are still largely unknown. It is therefore essential to create further insights into possible health effects of NNS. Especially in a manner similar to the way in which consumers are exposed to them, that is through food products containing NNS. The clinical trial will investigate health effects when NNS's are consumed in a realistic setting.  

  

**Your duties and responsibilities include:*** preparing the medical ethical approval documents in collaboration with the project team;
* designing test diets and operational procedures for a human dietary intervention trial together with the staff of the Human Research Unit (HRU);

**Your job**
------------


How the overturning circulation of the Mediterranean Sea responds to variations in forcing (tectonics and climate) is a fundamental question that potentially has global significance given that Mediterranean circulation has elements in common with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. It is also a highly relevant question for the countries bordering the sea in view of our warming climate.


In this NWO (Dutch Research Council)-funded project we will exploit the paleoceanographical record of the late Quaternary which provides an exceptional dataset on e.g. water properties, intensity of intermediate and deep-water formation and strait flow. You will design and execute experiments with dynamic box models and evaluate their results using the available data. The geometrically simple box model is chosen because it can be run following the evolution of circulation and water properties through time, thus doing justice to the transient nature of the processes at play. The analysis will focus on the role of:


* the Strait of Sicily;
* the properties of the inflowing waters; and
* sea-level variation.


You will be based at the department of Earth Sciences where you will be part of a vibrant PhD community and where expertise in both paleoceanography/paleoclimate and numerical modelling is amply available.


A personalised training programme will be set up, reflecting your training needs and career objectives. About 20% of your time will be dedicated to this training component, which includes training on the job in assisting in the Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes of the department.


**Your qualities**
------------------


You must have completed your MSc degree in Earth Sciences, Physical Oceanography, or a related discipline by the time the position starts. We seek candidates that have a keen interest in working on the interface between marine geology and physical oceanography. The ideal candidate:


* has knowledge of and experience with numerical modelling applied to Earth’s processes, using programming languages such as Python, MATLAB or R;
* has a solid basis in physics - specific knowledge regarding physical oceanography or (geophysical) fluid mechanics is an asset;
* is trained in the concepts of sedimentary geology required for this project: aspects of sedimentology, stratigraphy and paleoceanography;
* is willing and able to interact with specialists in the various disciplines that come together in this project.

**Your job**
------------


The aim of this PhD project is to test whether chimpanzees have the capability and motivation to develop cumulative cultures – the process in which cultural innovations incrementally shape cultural expressions such that they become better suited for their envisioned purpose. You will study chimpanzees’ potential to create and maintain cumulatively established cultures by means of targeted experimental assays. Moreover, you will investigate whether chimpanzees’ social network properties are predictive of their potential to develop cumulative cultures with behavioural observations and network analyses. The position involves 90% research time and 10% teaching activities within the group.


You will be hosted in the Primate Culture Origins Group, led by Dr Edwin van Leeuwen. The group focuses on cultural evolution in non-human primates. You will be embedded in this team in Utrecht, and co-supervised by Daniel Haun, director of the Department of Comparative Cultural Psychology at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI EVA) and Josep Call, Professor in Evolutionary Origins of Mind, University of St. Andrews.


You will conduct a series of studies investigating the cognitive foundations of cumulative cultural evolution in humans’ closest living relatives. The project will be a combination of behavioural studies with chimpanzees in group settings at the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust (CWOT) in Zambia. Furthermore, there are possibilities to conduct research at the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Centre in Germany and the Budongo Research Unit in Edinburgh Zoo. Lastly, there is room to extend research efforts to bonobos. The aim of the project is to assess great apes abilities for cumulative cultural evolution. The project will involve periodic fieldwork (approx. 3-4 months/year) at the CWOT in Zambia.


The CWOT houses chimpanzees in multigenerational groups under semi-natural conditions in a large forested private area in northern Zambia. The chimpanzees forage and sleep outside, and only come inside once per day for supplemental feeding. The setup is very suited for behavioural group-level experiments with relatively high ecological validity.


The project will be a collaborative project involving coordinated contributions from 3 PhD candidates working on the same topic The MPI EVA is recruiting for one of the other PhD positions in this project.


Come join our team in this exciting PhD position and:


* combine observational and experimental methods involving behavioural and cognitive measures;
* work independently at a remote field-site in Zambia;
* develop theoretical models of cumulative cultural evolution;
* conduct advanced statistical and analytic analyses on behavioural data;
* supervise Bachelor's and Master's students (10% of your time).

-------------------


  
Ben jij een ervaren python developer en wil je jouw kennis en ervaring inzetten om de wereld veiliger en rechtvaardiger te maken, dan zijn wij op zoek naar jou! Als medior python developer bij het team Forensische Big Data Analyse (FBDA) van het Nederlands Forensisch Instituut (NFI) in Den Haag, zet jij jouw programmeervaardigheden in bij het oplossen van uitdagende forensische data-sciencevraagstukken.



Bij FBDA passen we data science toe binnen de strafrechtketen. Wij ontwikkelen modellen die de doorslag kunnen geven in de opsporing of een grote strafzaak. Daarnaast besteden we tijd aan R&D, om up-to-date te blijven binnen ons vakgebied. Zo doen we kennis op die we kunnen inzetten in ons eigen werk, maar ook kunnen delen met ketenpartners binnen het veiligheidsdomein. Een aantal voorbeelden van projecten waar de afgelopen jaren aan gewerkt hebben:


* Het ontwerpen en trainen van deep-learningmodellen voor het herkennen van vuurwapens in miljoenen afbeeldingen.
* Het finetunen van open-source-audiomodellen zoals Whisper, om tapgesprekken automatisch om te zetten in tekst.
* Het trainen van een taalmodel op assembly code om vergelijkbare stukken code te vinden, waarmee we onze collega’s bij hardware vooruithelpen.
* Het ontwikkelen van een model waarmee onze collega's bij de politie automatisch doodsbedreigingen kunnen herkennen.
* Het combineren van Bayesiaanse statistiek en machine learning om de bewijskracht van locatiesporen te berekenen in opdracht van het Openbaar Ministerie.


Kortom, door de diversiteit aan data, samenwerkingen en technieken is iedere opdracht weer anders en op zijn eigen manier uitdagend. Ben je benieuwd naar voorbeelden? Niet alles wat we doen kan gepubliceerd worden, maar als het even kan dragen we een steentje bij aan de open-source community:


* De GitHub pagina van het NFI, waar repositories en datasets van verschillende teams zijn gepubliceerd.
* Onze HuggingFace presence waar we datasets en getrainde modellen publiceren.
* De presentatie van onze collega op de EuroPython-conferentie over het herkennen van doodsbedreigingen in tekstberichten.
* Het paper dat we gepubliceerd hebben over het gebruik van machine-learningmodellen in de rechtszaal.


Als medior python developer breng jij de kwaliteit van onze codebases naar een hoger niveau. Met jouw kennis van de best practices binnen software development zorgen we dat onze data science projecten goed leesbaar, testbaar en begrijpelijk zijn. Je vindt snel je weg door bestaande code en weet ook hoe je een nieuwe repository opzet, die over een paar jaar nog steeds bruikbaar en begrijpelijk is. Jouw ervaring met het ontwikkelen en/of onderhouden van libraries zal hierbij goed van pas komen. Ook geef je je collega's constructieve feedback op hun programmeerstijl door middel van code reviews en pair programming. Je bent een Python-enthousiasteling die een visie heeft op het schrijven van leesbare en gestructureerde code. Je weet alles van coding best-practices, zoals modulariteit, uitbreidbaarheid en robuustheid. Ook het schrijven van goede tests en het implementeren van CI/CD pipelines zijn voor jou standaardprocedure. Je houdt de ontwikkelingen van Python bij en je weet praktische tools te vinden die je deelt met collega's. Je bent niet bang om je probleemoplossend vermogen in te zetten bij de uitdagende data-sciencevraagstukken waar ons team aan werkt.

Ben jij een datascientist met ervaring binnen de veiligheidsketen en wil je je inzetten om onze datascienceprojecten beter te laten aansluiten in het veiligheidsdomein, dan zijn wij op zoek naar jou! Als forensisch datascientist bij het team Forensische Big Data Analyse (FBDA) van het NFI, zet jij jouw professionele netwerk en technische kennis in bij het oplossen van uitdagende forensische datasciencevraagstukken.



Bij FBDA passen we datascience toe binnen de strafrechtketen. Wij ontwikkelen modellen die de doorslag kunnen geven in de opsporing of een grote strafzaak. Daarnaast besteden we tijd aan R&D, om up-to-date te blijven binnen ons vakgebied. Zo doen we kennis op die we kunnen inzetten in ons eigen werk, maar ook kunnen delen met ketenpartners binnen het veiligheidsdomein. Een aantal voorbeelden van projecten waar de afgelopen jaren aan gewerkt hebben:


* Het ontwerpen en trainen van deeplearningmodellen voor het herkennen van vuurwapens in miljoenen afbeeldingen.
* Het finetunen van open source audiomodellen zoals Whisper, om tapgesprekken automatisch om te zetten in tekst.
* Het trainen van een taalmodel op assemblycode om vergelijkbare stukken code te vinden, waarmee we onze collega’s bij hardware vooruithelpen.
* Het ontwikkelen van een model waarmee onze collega's bij de politie automatisch doodsbedreigingen kunnen herkennen.
* Het combineren van Bayesiaanse statistiek en machinelearning om de bewijskracht van locatiesporen te berekenen in opdracht van het Openbaar Ministerie.


Kortom, door de diversiteit aan data, samenwerkingen en technieken is iedere opdracht weer anders en op zijn eigen manier uitdagend. Ben je benieuwd naar voorbeelden? Niet alles wat we doen kan gepubliceerd worden, maar als het even kan dragen we een steentje bij aan de opensourcecommunity:


* De GitHub pagina van het NFI, waar repositories en datasets van verschillende teams zijn gepubliceerd.
* Onze HuggingFace presence waar we datasets en getrainde modellen publiceren.
* De presentatie van onze collega op de EuroPython conferentie over het herkennen van doodsbedreigingen in tekstberichten.
* Het paper dat we gepubliceerd hebben over het gebruik van machinelearningmodellen in de rechtszaal.


We zijn specifiek op zoek naar een datascientist met een achtergrond in de veiligheidsketen, zoals de politie, FIOD of Koninklijke Marechaussee. Jouw netwerk van relevante contacten komt goed van pas wanneer we oplossingen maken voor ketenpartners en bij het bepalen van onze eigen R&D-prioritering. Jij begrijpt hoe de dagelijkse realiteit van de opsporing in elkaar steekt en je weet wat er speelt binnen het veiligheidsdomein. Als voornaamste contactpersoon voor onze collega's binnen de veiligheidsketen, sluit je bijvoorbeeld aan bij bijeenkomsten vanuit de keten met andere datascientists over nieuwe toepassingen van datasciencemodellen. In je dagelijkse werkzaamheden werk je als datascientist, je kan uit de voeten met Python-code en wordt enthousiast van het toepassen van modellen op grote hoeveelheden data.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
* Je hebt een wo-werk- en -denkniveau;
* Je hebt tenminste twee jaar ervaring in de veiligheidsketen. Je begrijpt hoe de opsporing in elkaar zit en hebt een netwerk binnen een van de grote opsporingsdiensten van Nederland (bijv. politie, FIOD, KMAR);

***Challenge: Advancing the energy transition requires understanding complex subsurface environments.***


***Change: Developing an innovative nonlinear data assimilation strategy that can adapt itself to the challenges of different natural systems.***


***Impact: This method will permit safer, more predictable operations in the subsurface and beyond.***


Job description


The subsurface plays a critical role in tackling the challenges of a changing climate. It provides drinking water amidst increasingly frequent droughts, and it is a keystone of the energy transition by providing geothermal energy and storage space for hydrogen. Despite its importance, our insights into the subsurface's properties and processes are scarce, limiting our ability to fully characterize this environment. The resulting uncertainties require careful analysis to inform societally responsible subsurface operations: How can we sustainably heat as many homes as possible? Where shall we establish the next hydrogen storage reservoir? What can we do to mitigate our operation's environmental and economic risks?



To answer such questions, data assimilation systematically combines numerical models with data to explore different possibilities of what the true system could be like, but its implementation remains a challenge in complex systems. Most data assimilation methods either over-simplify or are prohibitively inefficient, which compromises our decision-making. In this project, you will join a collaboration between TU Delft and the Norwegian energy company Equinor to co-develop an improved data assimilation strategy that uses a statistical method related to normalizing flows and diffusion models. This method can exploit advanced information about the numerical model, such as which variables are indirectly related to each other (conditional independence) or degrees of nonlinearity (How complex do we have to make our updates?). This allows us to create a powerful data assimilation framework that is always as simple as possible and as complex as necessary, which yields improved subsurface characterizations that will enable better, more reliable decision making.



As a PhD student at TU Delft, you will:


* Familiarize yourself with the methodological foundations of triangular measure transport and data assimilation
* Co-develop a scalable, adaptive, nonlinear data assimilation method based on triangular transport
* Explore innovative strategies to adapt the method to different environmental systems
* Apply the resulting algorithm to analyse the properties and uncertainties of a real geothermal operation


This four-year project is part of a collaboration between TU Delft and DA research at Equinor in Bergen, Norway. You will join the reservoir engineering section at TU Delft’s Department of Geoscience & Engineering, where you will find a vibrant and collaborative environment in which you will have the opportunity to interact with experts in data assimilation, geothermal energy, and numerical simulation. You will be encouraged to learn new skills and develop your own ideas, and you will share your findings at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. These experiences will pave the way for diverse career paths in industry, consultancy, governmental agencies, or academia.


Requirements


* You hold a Masters degree in geoscience, geophysics, applied mathematics/statistics, or a similar field
* You thrive on systematic, code-based research, and have an aptitude for abstract or mathematical thinking.
* You have a keen interest in data assimilation and machine learning, and are excited to explore their applications in complex environmental systems
* You have experience with Python or a similar programming language. Experience with computationally intensive numerical methods is a plus.
* You are a highly motivated and self-driven researcher, capable of working both independently and as part of a team
* You have an excellent command of written and spoken English


Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.


Conditions of employment


Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.



Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2770 per month in the first year to € 3539 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School.

**About us**
------------


*Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden is the Dutch national research institute for biodiversity and systematics. With our collection of 43 million specimens, one of the world's largest natural history collections, and our state-of-the-art research facilities we develop the (inter)national research infrastructure for species, identification and monitoring. We closely collaborate with many Dutch universities, research institutes, industry, and government. We host over 150 researchers including 15 academia embedded professors and about 50 PhD students and 30 postdocs. We are an international hub for capacity building: training and educating students and experts, the new generation of modern taxonomists. We present the history of our planet, and the diversity of life on Earth, through permanent and temporary museum exhibitions, educational programmes, and online presence, with more than 500,000 visitors per year. All in all, a unique combination of science and culture in the Netherlands and elsewhere in the world!*


The effects of climate change and biodiversity loss are being felt worldwide. Despite the available biodiversity knowledge and the many organisations aiming for nature conservation, the Netherlands suffers more biodiversity loss than most European countries. To translate the increasing political need to stop further biodiversity loss and work towards solutions, governments and industry in the Netherlands (and Europe) urgently need up-to-date knowledge on all facets of biodiversity and supporting data. This requires a radical new integrated approach to monitoring technologies, new monitoring and assessment tools, and more scientific research.


Naturalis is in the middle of this development. We host one of the world's largest and most important natural history collections, a physical reference collection with unlimited potential for biodiversity research. We enhance our digital collection with digital twins, broadening our specimen based digitization concept with species-based digitization activities. We build a national research infrastructure that will enable science to identify species faster, monitor them more easily and gain better insights into interaction networks and ecosystems. The scientific results will enable the government and companies to better protect biodiversity in the Netherlands.


We are, therefore, expanding our scientific research on Dutch species in the coming years, focusing in particular on research integrating molecular techniques, imaging techniques and data science (AI) to enhance species recognition and detection. Naturalis wants to be able to identify and monitor all Dutch species. This means we face the exciting challenge to accelerate the discovery, identification, and description of species in our soil, rivers, sea and air that so far have escaped our attention. With ARISE, eDentity and Noordzeker we will have the conditional infrastructural building blocks and facilities to build the research infrastructure. Still a lot of scientific research needs to be done to integrate the building blocks into a fully operational research infrastructure and to develop it towards a radical new approach of discovering, identifying and monitoring all Dutch species in a way that can be scaled to include European or even global biodiversity.


Find out more about our research, labs and collection.


**Positions**
-------------


We are seeking two ambitious, enthusiastic, innovative scientists to strengthen our research on Dutch species, actively supporting the development of our national research infrastructures. We will challenge you to develop your leadership skills and to set up your own line of research.

**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


In nauwe samenwerking met de operationeel liaisons, de data-analist en je collega-ontwikkelaars werk je aan innovatieve oplossingen die onze collega’s in de operatie (opsporing, intelligence en handhaving) ondersteunen om meer rendement te halen uit operationele informatie. Door het inzichtelijk maken van grote hoeveelheden data geef je jouw collega’s handvatten om nieuwe complexe vraagstukken op te pakken of bestaande operationele vragen beter en sneller te kunnen beantwoorden. Denk aan de informatie die op telefoons van verdachten wordt gevonden, maar ook aan de banktransacties waarin criminele activiteiten gevonden kunnen worden. Je beoordeelt vragen vanuit de operatie en speelt een belangrijke rol in het bieden van advies en handelingsperspectief aan operationele teams. Je krijgt een uitdagende en afwisselende functie binnen een maatschappelijk relevante organisatie, in een collegiaal en gemotiveerd team dat samen met jou wil bouwen aan innovatieve oplossingen.  

  

Als software developer bij TROI heb je maatschappelijke impact en draag je bij aan applicaties en tools die het bijvoorbeeld mogelijk maken dat grote criminelen worden gestopt, vermiste personen worden teruggevonden of verdachten van ernstige misdrijven worden opgespoord.


**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


Als teamlid van TROI werk je onder andere samen met de TROI-teams van de andere eenheden en met het Team Business Intelligence en Kwaliteit (BI&K) in Den Haag. TROI houdt zich bezig met het inzichtelijk maken van de relevante informatie uit ‘big data’, brengt deze informatie samen en levert een bijdrage aan het komen tot tools, applicaties, analyses, inzicht en handelingsperspectief. TROI experimenteert met innovatieve methodieken en samen met jouw collega’s denk je buiten de bestaande kaders, om te komen tot realistische en passende oplossingen.  

  

TROI Den Haag bestaat uit twee volwaardige subteams die onderling samenwerken en tezamen één geheel vormen. In beide teams worden zowel ad hoc vragen uit lopende onderzoeken opgepakt (het werkproces support/zaaksondersteuning) als grotere projecten die breder inzetbaar zijn binnen bijvoorbeeld de opsporing (het werkproces development). Hoewel beide werkprocessen veel raakvlakken hebben en in elkaar kunnen overlopen, ligt jouw rol voornamelijk binnen het werkproces support.  

De ambities zijn groot en het enthousiasme om goede tools te ontwikkelen is bij elke medewerker aanwezig. Het team bestaat uit diverse specialisten, zoals UX/UI designers, front- en backend developers, testers, data scientists, analisten en specialisten op het gebied van de opsporing en ander operationeel politiewerk. Deze specialisten hebben elkaar nodig om een goed product voor de operatie neer te zetten. We zijn als team volop in ontwikkeling en hebben momentum binnen de organisatie om op inhoud en proces innovatief te werken. Kernwoorden passend bij ons team: innovatief, ‘outside the box’, ondernemend, positief kritisch en ontwikkelen. Daarnaast delen we de drive om anderen te helpen.


Hoewel de standplaats Voorburg is, wordt er van je verwacht dat je daarnaast op diverse locaties werkzaam bent, waarvan het hoofdbureau in Den Haag een veel voorkomende zal zijn. Het kan voorkomen dat je voor het werk moet reizen en eventueel voor een periode op een andere locatie werkzaamheden verricht. In overleg bestaat de mogelijkheid om de werkzaamheden deels vanuit huis te verrichten.


**Wie ben jij?**
----------------


Met enthousiasme, leergierigheid en gedrevenheid zoek je altijd naar de beste en juiste oplossing. Je bent allround inzetbaar als software developer, van het bouwen van grotere tooling tot het schrijven van een script op maat. Vanuit jouw passie voor dit vak blijf je op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen op het gebied van programmeren. Als persoon ben je gewend om het initiatief te pakken en eigenaarschap te tonen, maar blijf je altijd een teamspeler. Je vindt het leuk om in een team te werken waarin ieder zijn eigen expertise heeft en waar je elkaar aanvult. Ook weet je van aanpakken en werk je graag in een Agile omgeving waarin het snel en adequaat reageren op operationele vragen centraal staat. Het opbouwen en inzetten van jouw netwerk is een eigenschap die je beheerst. Je kunt snel schakelen en effectief werken onder druk en binnen strakke deadlines. Verder ben je analytisch sterk en denk je in oplossingen, waarbij je grote brokken informatie of grote opgaven weet op te splitsen in kleine, concrete stappen. Je bent communicatief vaardig waardoor je collega's mee kan nemen in jouw wereld en je kunt ook doorvragen naar de behoeften van de opsporingsteams en informatieorganisatie.


Verder beschik je over:


* hbo (bachelor) werk- en denkniveau\*, bij voorkeur op basis van een opleiding op het vlak van informatica;
* minimaal 1 jaar ervaring met software-ontwikkeling met Python, Javascript en SQL/NoSQL databases;

You get to actively explore, design, build and run data lakes in AWS. Your work will be completely customer-focused but you will also contribute to expanding and maturing the Schuberg Philis data landscape architecture and all of its initiatives.


**Who are we looking for?**



In this role, you will thrive if you have the following experience:


* Building data pipelines in a cloud-native manner (e.g. S3, Lambda's, Glue, etc )

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack.

Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)
* Python en SQL

**Fijne pre's:**

* Kennis van jaarrekeningcontrole
* Kennis van Microsoft Fabric
* Kennis van Pyspark

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.

Maar dat is zeker niet het enige. De Rabobank is een coöperatieve bank met een missie. Samen met klanten, leden en partners zet de Rabobank zich in voor een sterkere leefomgeving en voor de grote maatschappelijke uitdagingen van nu, met als uitgangspunt dat er samen meer bereikt wordt dan alleen. Die missie kan alleen waargemaakt worden doordat Rabobank een krachtige bank is die efficiënt werkt.


Daarnaast is Rabobank actief betrokken bij veel maatschappelijke initiatieven. Een deel van de winst wordt geïnvesteerd in de samenleving. Verder weg, door te zorgen dat boeren een eerlijke prijs krijgen voor hun producten. En dichtbij, door in heel Nederland samen buurten beter te maken. Zo’n 1250 organisaties in sport en cultuur die voor veel mensen een tweede thuis zijn worden ondersteund. Een ander voorbeeld is het project met Humanitas, waarin mensen worden geholpen die financiële problemen hebben hun thuisadministratie op orde te krijgen. Een derde voorbeeld is dat samen met Vluchtelingenwerk Nederland 1.500 vluchtelingen worden geholpen bij het vinden van een goed passende baan.


Om haar kerntaak blijvend te realiseren heeft Rabobank een ambitieus plan opgesteld waarin het creëren van een optimale Engineering Journey een belangrijke pijler is.

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

As a data platform engineer, you will be working on our data platform named Thor. With Thor, we want to create a self-service, metadata driven data platform where data producers can share their data with the data consumers without the platform team being the bottleneck.

 **A few cool new features we have recently implemented:**

* Smart Scheduling that dynamically changes data pipeline configuration based on historical statistics
* A versioned data platform that allows the product to scale to other brands
* Documentation that writes itself

You are not in it alone! You will get guidance from a team member and have many opportunities to fine-tune your ideas and action plan with colleagues.

  

  

Besides this core project, you will also be invited to participate in the team’s agile rituals and other activities, contribute to the maintenance of existing and building of new reports and can also get your hands dirty in our ongoing dashboard migration and data modelling projects.

**Wat breng jij mee?**

With your 'can do' mentality, you connect the different teams in the data flow from source to dashboard to speed up the generation of insights for all the important business decisions we make every day, based on reliable data. You are able to independently tackle various human and organizational issues, from data collection to managing of expectations.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**Sluitingsdatum:** 18.08.2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13165
We have two positions available for a PhD Student in Cellular imaging and in Neuroscience. The two positions are funded by a grant from NWO “Visualizing and manipulating synaptic AMPA-receptor plasticity with a new molecular toolkit”. The two PhD students are expected to closely collaborate within this project.  


The two positions are embedded respectively in the following two UvA/SILS research groups:  


Molecular Cytology studies the dynamic architecture of living cells. By employing genetic encoded fluorescent biosensors we analyze the molecular interactions between signaling molecules and flow of information across and in the plane of the membrane of living mammalian cells. We aim to understand how cells respond to internal and external cues using advanced microscopy tools.  


**Project 1**: Engineering of novel tools for visualization and manipulation of signaling molecules that drive synaptic plasticity.  


This project builds on our efforts to engineer biosensors ad optogenetic tools that can be used in relevant complex biological systems to interrogate signaling networks. In this project protein engineering and microscopy-based screening will be applied to generate new biosensors that have lifetime contrast, as these have advantageous properties for quantitative imaging in complex systems. In addition, we aim to generate genetically encoded components that can manipulate cAMP levels or other signaling components that potentially control synaptic AMPA-receptor plasticity.  


Cellular and Computational Neuroscience is part of the SILS Neuroscience theme and investigates the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity mechanism that underlie learning and memory, at the level of cellular and network neuroscience using electrophysiological, live-imaging, pharmacological and molecular techniques.  


**Project 2**: Understanding the synaptic plasticity mechanisms that underlie memory retrieval  


In this project the synaptic plasticity processes will be examined that underlie memory retrieval in the hippocampus. We hypothesize that noradrenaline signalling selectively increases the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP at actively communicating synapses, thereby increasing conductance of AMPA-receptors at these synapses. To study these molecular processes, whole-cell electrophysiology will be combined with live-imaging and optogenetics. This project is directly relevant to increase our understanding of how memories can be reactivated and why memory retrieval is impaired in early Alzheimer’s disease.  

  

**What are you going to do?**  

  

As a PhD student, you are expected to:

 (Graduate School Neurosciences Amsterdam and Rotterdam);  

* teach seminars and/or practical for bachelor and master students;
* supervise bachelor and master student projects;
* present data at local, national and international scientific meetings.
  


**What do we require?**  

  

You are a highly motivated, ambitious student with a Master degree in Molecular Life Sciences (**project 1**), Neuroscience (**project 2**), or equivalent.

The Faculty of Science and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) are looking for:

**PhD candidate | Environmental impact assessment of pollution at the ecosystem level (0.8-1.0 fte)**

**Vacancy number: (14994)**


**Background**


The freshwater system and its adjacent ecosystems host countless species because of their need of water. These are the earths’ natural capital and drivers of many ecosystem services we humans depend on. At the same time, the presence and effects of anthropogenic stress in the aquatic environment are multitude and ubiquitous. These include the omnipresence of chemical pollution such as the use of agricultural chemicals.


To relatively quickly assess the impacts of chemicals a standard risk assessment framework is in place. While valuable, the frameworks often lacks ecological realism. Researchers from Leiden University therefore experiment in outdoor freshwater experimental systems with natural food webs such as the “Levend Lab” (EN: “Living Lab”, https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/livinglab) to identify how biodiversity responds to the impacts of pesticides, fertilizers, invasive species and nanomaterials.


Using ecological theory, a large array of different experimental and statistical analytical methods are currently in practice to perform and analyze such experiments. The key challenge for the PhD candidate is to test these different forms of experimental and statistical analytical methods to identify stressor - ecosystem function relationships. The research will likely entail measuring different forms of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functionality followed by statistical modelling to infer causality of stressor impacts and their propagation through the ecosystem.


We invite prospective candidates to unravel the intricate network of species interactions between each other and their environment. The candidate will use new analytical methods and develops models and interpretation scenarios to identify how pollution impacts species and their role in ecosystem functionality.

**Key tasks:**

* *Perform* mesocosm pollution experiments in the ‘Levend Lab’ facility of Leiden University
* *Further develop* and test different types of statistical analyses at the community to ecosystem level
* *Advance* ecological theory by identifying the anthropological and natural drivers of species and their roles in ecosystems

**Selection criteria:**

* You should have an M.Sc. in a relevant field (environmental science, biology, ecology and/or ecotoxicology), but we also consider candidates from other related scientific fields.
* Experience with experimental field and laboratory skills and (aquatic) organism identifications are highly valued
* Strong background and interest in statistical analyses, data management, visualization and coding skills (in R, but Python also applies) is highly valued.
* You must be proficient in spoken and written English.
* You are a team player and have a collaborative attitude.


**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,800 staff and almost 6,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 150 FTE (including postdocs and PhD candidates) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

Je weet feilloos wanneer PR de grens van commercie of marketing raakt en wanneer een kans kan omslaan in een (reputationele) bedreiging. Daarnaast ben je goed op de hoogte van wat er leeft onder onze klanten, in de maatschappij en in de financiële sector en spot jij kansen die je pro-actief ter tafel brengt. Je onderhoudt bovendien een sterk en stabiel netwerk van journalisten bij nationale media en influencers. Hiervoor werk je nauw samen met de woordvoerders van de bank.

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van het AD in Rotterdam. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data.

Naast redactie-analisten zijn er diverse centrale rollen in het team die jou bij je werk zullen ondersteunen.  

  

**Functieprofiel**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.

* 38-urige werkweek, minder uur in overleg;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van de PZC in Middelburg. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data.

De adviezen geef je op drie ‘snelheden’: live, in dag- en weekrapporten en in grotere analyses. Op de dag zelf kijk je met een schuin oog mee naar de cijfers en deel je belangrijke actiegerichte inzichten met de redactie. In dag- en weekrapporten geef je duiding aan de cijfers.

* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;

**Wat doe je als Informatiemanager bij IVO Rechtspraak?**
---------------------------------------------------------


Jouw werk is van grote invloed op de rechtspraak. En daarmee op het leven van mensen. Want de rechtspraak kan niet zonder goede informatie. En die moet voor álle betrokkenen eenvoudig beschikbaar zijn. Van rechters tot burgers die door een geschil of misdaad in een rechtszaak zijn verwikkeld. Jij speelt een centrale rol in die informatievoorziening. Een opdracht op niveau, waarbij de prioriteiten die jij stelt of laat stellen het verschil maken!


### **Hoe je werk eruitziet**


Ieder jaar zijn er zo’n 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken in Nederland. Binnen IVO Rechtspraak hebben we verschillende teams die zich bezighouden met informatievoorziening. In elk team stuurt een portefeuillehouder namens de business, met een rechtsgebied als focus: straf, civiel en bestuur, toezicht, familie en jeugd, Data en Registers en tot slot bedrijfsvoering. Jij bent de rechterhand van de portefeuillehouder en start bij het IV-team Bedrijfsvoering. De portefeuille Bedrijfsvoering levert generieke diensten aan Rechtspraak collega's en externe partijen, zoals burgers, rechtzoekenden, journalisten en ketenpartners. De portefeuille is onderverdeeld in de volgende vijf thema's waarbinnen alle verschillende applicaties van Bedrijfsvoering zijn ondergebracht; klantgerichte communicatie en kennisportalen, slim samenwerken en online zitten, creëren en delen van uitspraken, facilitering bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen en digitale informatiehuishouding


Samen met je collega-informatiemanagers breng jij in kaart welke informatie nodig is om rechtszaken en bedrijfsondersteunende processen optimaal te laten verlopen. Daar maak je voor jouw thema beleid op, ook voor de lange termijn. En je ziet toe op de uitvoering van dat beleid. Zo bouw je mee aan de digitale toekomst van de rechtspraak in ons land.


Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware twee talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.

By breaking down borders and bringing on a wide variety of clients and positions we try to make sure there’s a position and dream destination for everyone.

Furthermore, we are a big multinational team, living and working in many different countries, but working closely both in and between teams!

Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.  

  

**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.

* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.
