 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!



One very important note….don't hold back! Even if you think you don't meet 100% of the criteria listed in this job role, we still encourage you to apply. We believe that everyone should have equal access to opportunities and want to ensure we provide an inclusive experience, so do let us know if there is anything else we can do to support your application process.

Join us on our journey as Splunk Solution Engineer, and enjoy a culture of inclusiveness, disruption, and fun while selling smart and winning big.
What’s the role of a Solution Engineer at Splunk?* You will technically own, discover, position, prove and deliver the key technical elements of a sales cycle to achieve a ‘technical win’ within large scale and complex customer environments. You’ll use a range of communication styles, a range of technology skills and experiences and a range of soft skills and people skills to develop trust relationships with both your sales colleagues and your customers.
* You will be an advocate and ambassador for Splunk through your professional social media, industry and marketing events and supporting pipeline generation activities
* You will collaborate with your customer contacts, and build them into Splunk champions, by helping them to understand how Splunk can help them to solve some of their most challenging problems and help them achieve their objectives.


Responsibilities:* Ability to demonstrate Splunk products and services to customers on site, remotely via webinar sessions, and at field events such as conferences and trade shows.
* Establish and maintain strong relationships throughout the sales cycle with all levels within the customer.

* Technically Astute: You enjoy the detail, even if you don’t always need to express it. You have a thirst for up-to-date knowledge of the technologies and solutions that businesses use to be successful as they transform.
* Confidence: But not arrogant – you have the confidence that comes from the knowledge that your product is rock solid, and the ability to transmit this confidence to a customer. That means you might sit down with a customer already using your product to show them how they might use it even better!
* Business Savvy: You understand how businesses are organized, how they achieve their desired results, what challenges they are likely to face, what solutions they need and what transformations they could make with your solutions.
* A growth mindset: You build in time to develop your skills, knowledge, experience or capabilities. You look beyond the current opportunity towards the wider set of opportunities that could exist in a prospect.
* A Collaborator: You understand that selling is a team game, so you spend time developing your network of colleagues and partners to achieve your success – and theirs.
* Competitive: If you’re in it, you want to win it!
* Fun: Getting the job done and enjoying & generating fun don’t need to be mutually exclusive.
* The candidate must be based in the Netherlands and be fluent in Dutch and English.


Helpful technical skills or experience (not all required, but consider how Splunk could benefit from your background)* Domain knowledge and experience in any of the following areas: IT infrastructure, Cloud Technologies, Application Delivery, Business Analytics or Log Management

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!

GCA’s strategy in Africa is implemented under the flagship Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP), launched by GCA and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to scale up adaptation efforts and mobilize finance for climate-resilient development in Africa. To date, GCA has integrated adaptation solutions into $9 billion worth of investments funded by IFIs across Africa.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Then this is a great opportunity to join our team and help us to further****develop our forest research and forest resources models like EFISCEN-Space!**  

  

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research and modelling of European forest resources.  

  

An important element of our work is the development and application of European forest simulation models like EFISCEN-Space Such models aim to understand and visualize the role that European forests play for biodiversity, climate, soil, renewable resources and the environment, and how Climate-Smart Forest management can contribute to optimize this role. With these models, we help managers and various authorities (local, regional, national and EU) to evaluate and further shape European forest and climate policies.  

  

You will be responsible for the implementation and management support of current projects including the communication with EU project partners. This will be done in consultation with the project leader, and you will replace the project leader when needed in project related matters. You will actively engage in acquisition of new projects and develop yourself into an independent project leader. Together with the team you will further develop and refine various functionalities of the simulation models (e.g. forest management, harvest costs & revenues, biodiversity, soil carbon) and apply them in the projects.  

Besides this, you will also orientate yourself on developments in related (forest) ecological and forest management or monitoring disciplines. In the team and within projects, you contribute to model development, research, improving and interpreting research results together with other (senior) researchers and project leaders. You will also contribute to the acquisition of externally funded scientific research on Dutch and European forests in the context of (climate) policy and management studies. Depending on your level of experience also supervision of more junior researchers will be part of your work.  

  

Examples of projects we work in are: TRANSFORMIT, WILDCARD, MoniFun, SUPERB and Holisoils. Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:* working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;
* the option to accrue additional compensation hours by working more;
* sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
* there is a strong focus on vitality and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
* a fixed December bonus of 8,3%;
* excellent pension scheme.

We offer, depending on your experience, a competitive gross salary of between €3088 and € 6522 for a full-time working week of 36 hours, in accordance with the CLA Wageningen Research (scale 10-12). Additionally, a contract for 32 hours can be discussed. You will initially receive a one-year contract, which under unchanged market conditions can be extended upon in mutual enthusiasm.

 Apply Now
Join ReBioClim, a Project Aiming to Pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in Four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.
* Ability to work independently and in a result-oriented way.
* Availability to start in January 2025.


Nice-to-haves:


* Experience in conducting geospatial analysis in a programming environment such as R or Python.
* Knowledge of co-design workshop methodologies.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

Join ReBioClim, a project aiming to pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.
* Ability to work independently and in a result-oriented way.
* Availability to start in January 2025.


Nice-to-haves:


* Experience in conducting geospatial analysis in a programming environment such as R or Python.
* Knowledge of co-design workshop methodologies.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

**Background**


Within ING we make use of data science for a variety of use cases (such as improving financial health of our customers by transaction forecasting). The data science models which run in production all generate output this data needs to be delivered to different destination within ING. These destinations vary from data lakes and kafka topics to Cassandra datastores.


In the past a generic Interface format (GI) was developed as a one size fits all solution to standardize the output delivery for our data-scientists. Over time many models have adopted this interface but we are now facing challenges such as files which became too big or the throughput time is too long.

**The opportunity**


We would like to deep-dive into this topic by dedicating an intern as engineer to investigate our use cases and look for a future proof solution. This includes gathering information, do market research (buy vs built) and design / develop one or more prototypes together with our data-scientists data engineers.

**Team** **overview**


You, as an intern will join one of our data-engineering teams which support the ING data-scientists. The teams work on a variety of topics to maintain and evolve our data-analytics environment in Google Cloud.

* Located in our Amsterdam office.
* Mix of local and off-shore colleagues (so multiple nationalities)
* We work in agile teams based around Scrum and continuous delivery principles.
* Our teams work in hybrid mode, we work from home when possible and work from the office at least one day a week.
* We have 36 hour working weeks.

**Roles and responsibilities**


This assignment is about understanding and improving our way of distributing data-science model output. The current implementation of GI (Generic Interface) needs to be examined as well as our use cases and the industry standards available. The goal is to boost new alternatives and bring us further in achieving an excellent data-driven organization.

**Expected l****earnings**

You will be working in an environment with modern continuous delivery tools with people who have a continuous improvement mindset. Tools include Azure (CDaaS), Google GCP (Terraform, Vertex AI, BigQuery), NiFi for data flow management.


Working in a complex environment such as ING can be challenging and this is part of the learning and our people and teams are there to help you.


Communication and collaboration are key and this involves working closely together with domain experts such as data-engineers, data-scientists and machine learning engineers.

**Expected output**


An inventory of required features, an improved understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the current implementation and a redesign plus implementation plan (part of this can also contain a buy vs built decision or a vendor selection).


When time allows the output also consists of the implementation of a prototype solution.

**How to succeed**


You can succeed in this role by showing:

* a “can-do” mentality
* you are a “self starter” (pro-active)
* you speak out and like to challenge yourself and the people around you
* you have a background in IT, information management or similar
* experience and affinity with machine learning is very useful
* it helps if you like programming (python, java, scala) though this is not a show stopper

**Rewards and benefits**  

This is a great opportunity to train with highly skilled people who are experts in their field. You’ll do a lot and learn a lot –  

not only about your specialist area and the bank, but also about yourself and whether this type of environment is right for you.

  

You’ll also benefit from:

* Internship allowance of EUR 700/month for 36 hours (maximum)
* Compensation of travel costs
* Your own work laptop
* Hybrid working to blend home working for focus and office working for collaboration and co-creation

**Why?**

Every swipe, every like, every TikTok video we upload, every Zoom call we have, every Netflix video we watch, or everything we buy online is all processed and depends on… data centers. However, these data centers consume large amounts of energy due to the underlying technology we use every day all day.

**How?**

We have developed an AI-based analytics platform that captures the entire data center (DC) infrastructure—""from roof to room""—to bring the whole DC into a more optimal state. This platform saves energy, water, and scope 3 emissions while increasing reliability and sustainability in data centers across countries like Germany, France, the UK, Australia, and The Netherlands.

We seek a highly qualified **Data Science Lead** with extensive experience in setting up and scaling machine learning infrastructure, processes and teams.

Your outstanding and in-depth knowledge of (the latest) ML/ AI architectures and techniques allows you to make trade-offs in applying effective models to our data center optimization platform.

**Additionally you will**

* Be able to perform hands-on model development and deployment activities.
* Work closely with the AI research team to quickly identify new and potentially impactful developments in ML and AI.
* Support and enthuse our product managers in their quest to develop and deliver a market-changing solution that has its foundation rooted in a relentless focus on cutting-edge AI.
* Closely collaborate with our software engineers, MLOps engineers, and other stakeholders to ensure seamless integration of machine learning solutions into our products and services.

As such, this role represents a unique opportunity to have a broad impact on our organization and to contribute significantly to our technological evolution.

Job requirements

* Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science , Mathematics or a Physics related field with abundant ML experience.
* 5+ years of proven experience as a Data Scientist, preferably in a SaaS product domain.
* 1+ years experience in hiring and managing a team of data scientists.
* A preferred experience with ML/ AI that deals with physical processes and relations.
* Experience with cloud platforms and containerization technologies.
* Experience with one or more data science platforms like Dataiku, Databricks, DataRobot, etc.
* Strong programming skills in languages such as Python, Java, or Scala.
* Excellent problem-solving skills and ability to work in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.
* Strong communication skills and ability to effectively convey technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
* Strong pre: experience with on-prem ML model training, inference and deployment for production-grade solutions.
* Pre: experience with advanced ML/ AI deployments within an industrial domain.

* A hybrid home-office-remote policy with flexible working hours where we value your regular presence to enjoy team dynamics, but we like to support the flexibility that fits your daily rhythm and preference.

***This position seeks a junior scientific programmer to further develop and integrate existing movici and multi-model.nl platforms and support the development of new (multi-)models of infrastructure interactions. The work will be done in close cooperation with PhDs, postdoc, senior experts on modeling theory and decision-making and practitioners from infrastructure providers. This position can potentially be turned into a PhD postion.***


Job description


Infrastructures provide the basis for many critical societal processes, from economy to education, from healthcare to housing and more. The infrastructures are increasingly interdependent on each other, from providing mutual services (like energy and data for mobility), via to providing alternative capacity (like rail, road and waterways), to competing for the same space (like in urban contexts).



Models and simulations are key tools for decision makers, allowing them to build, design, and plan infrastructures. As the need for integrated, cross system insight rises, current monodisciplinary and mono-sectoral models are increasingly unable to provide the required insights. A promising direction is multi-modelling, where different models and simulations are combined in an ecosystem of tools, that can be used and re-used in different configurations. The model ecosystem, and the socio-technical approach to modelling poses new methodological and technical challenges.



Models are instrumental for supporting the social process of decision-making, and are not a goal in themselves. Key model and software requirements will stem from the users and the social process that they are involved in. You, as a developer will be involved in these processes where needed, but are not expected to organize and manage them.



Work will consist of two main lines, platform development and model development support. Platform development involves integration of existing open-source platforms MOVICI and multi-model.nl, identifying new requirements and features from the users and developing them. Model development includes software implementation and general computing and data analysis support for researchers, modelers and modelling and simulation theorists. You may also be asked for advice on the most suitable software solutions, data structures, architectures, code redesign where necessary.



Goal of the position is the further development of the MOVICI and multi-model.nl platform towards a tailored tool for broad impact analysis in a complex stakeholder environment. The later means a lot of attention for describing and modeling scenario’s, a wide range and flexible approach towards evaluative criteria for these scenario’s, clear visualizations in space and time on scenario development, and interconnection with other modeling platforms.



We are looking for a person who enjoys (re)design and implementation ""done right"", with long term maintainability, reusability and generalizability being important, without losing sight of practicality. Willingness to work closely with domain experts and modeling theorists is paramount. Correct and clean representation and implementation of the relevant concepts is much more important than churning out features quickly. You will be working in research focused academic setting, so affinity with science, scientific methods and processes is useful.


Requirements


The software stack is organised around open source workflows: git, python, docker, Apache Airflow, linux shell and some C++. We also make use of REST interfaces and client-server architectures where relevant. Prior experience with these technologies is desirable but is explicitly not expected. We do expect solid python programming ability, high level of general computing skills and eagerness to learn more, as well as a good command of the English language. Dutch proficiency is desired but not necessary.



This is a junior position, and your interests, willingness to learn and team fit are much more important than prior experience with specific technologies.



We are seeking a recent graduate from a computer science/ computer engineering / programming and/or data science-oriented MSc program, but candidates with different background are also encouraged to apply. The position could in term be changed to a modeling and simulation focused PhD position.



We expect that you will take the initiative, be independent and can handle a high degree of freedom, especially in the technical domain. However, you will not be left alone to “figure it all out by yourself”. You will be part of a team that takes personal development and growth, mental health and neurodiversity seriously. You will be working closely with Dr. Ir. I Nikolic, and Prof. Dr. W. Veeneman.


Conditions of employment


* A salary based on scale 9 of the CAO for Dutch Universities with a minimum of €3.377,- and a maximum of €4.640,- gross per month based on a fulltime contract (38 hours), plus 8% holiday allowance and an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%.
* An excellent pension scheme via the ABP.
* The possibility to compile an individual employment package every year.
* Discount with health insurers.
* Flexible working week.
* Every year, 232 leave hours (at 38 hours). You can also sell or buy additional leave hours via the individual choice budget.
* Plenty of opportunities for education, training and courses.
* Partially paid parental leave
* Attention for working healthy and energetically with the vitality program.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for:

**PhD candidate in Network Science (4 years)**


**About this position**  

Leiden University’s computer science department (LIACS), part of the Faculty of Science, is seeking an enthusiastic and well-qualified PhD candidate in network science, a field also referred to as complex networks or social network analysis. The position is for 4 years and is fully funded.  

The position is part of SSHOC-NL, a five-year national consortium project on advancing methods and infrastructure in, among others, the social sciences. Within SSHOC-NL Leiden University and University of Amsterdam jointly lead the work on large-scale social network analysis, which is the focus of this PhD position. While the position offers a certain degree of freedom in terms of the precise research direction, as part of the broader consortium project, the candidate will be asked to work on community detection in large-scale dynamic networks, and how this is affected by aggregation of the network. This ties into a broader objective of the consortium in which the aim is to understand how privacy-sensitive population-scale (network) data, possibly at an aggregated level, can be made accessible and interoperable.


The candidate will be part of the Platform for Large-scale Analysis of Networks Netherlands (PLANET-NL) interdisciplinary group of researchers in both computer science and social science, which will meet regularly as part of the broader consortium project. One particular object of study of this group, and thus possibly also for the candidate, is the multi-layer population-scale social network data of the Netherlands, featuring twelve years of longitudinal network data on all seventeen million inhabitants of the Netherlands and their family, work, school, neighbor and household ties (see, e.g., https://www.popnet.io).


The candidate will be encouraged to collaborate on projects with other members of the Computational Network Science (CNS, https://cns.liacs.nl) group. Moreover, there are ample opportunities to collaborate with other research groups at LIACS in for example data science, machine learning, text mining and algorithm design. It is furthermore possible to get engaged in (limited) BSc and MSc student (co-)supervision, as well as minor scientific organizational activities. Additionally, there are plenty of opportunities for interaction and collaboration, for example at the Faculty of Science through the Leiden Complex Networks Network (LCN2, https://lcn2.leidenuniv.nl) and nationally through the Dutch Network Science Society (https://www.netsci.nl).


To apply, candidates are required to submit, in addition to an academic CV, a brief motivation letter of at most 2 pages, including a short description of a research idea that the candidate would want to work on in light of this particular position.

**Key responsibilities**

* Conducting research in the area of network science, leading to peer-reviewed publications.
* Writing an article-based PhD thesis within the duration of the position.
* Participating in a broader national computational social science consortium project.
* Limited involvement in co-supervising BSc and MSc students and engaging in minor local organizational activities.
* Assist in relevant teaching activities.

**Required qualifications**

* A MSc\* in computer science or a related field (e.g., mathematics, physics or computational social science), ideally with experience (e.g., through a MSc thesis) on a networks-related topic.
* Experience with programming in Python and/or C++ and/or R, preferably with some large-scale network analysis experience.
* Willingness and ability to work in an interdisciplinary setting working across computer science and social sciences.
* Excellent proficiency of the English language.
* Able to work independently and in a team.
* An academic, creative and curious mindset.
* : excellent candidates not (yet) (fully) past the MSc phase, but sufficiently close to graduation, are also invited to apply.

  

**Our organisation**

Ben jij een kinderfysiotherapeut die gewend is om buiten de kaders van het normale denken te opereren. Heb jij ervaring met Artificial Intelligence (AI) en krijg je energie van het creëren van (technische) oplossingen voor complexe praktijk problemen.


Dan zijn we op zoek naar jou!


In het kader van een 2-jarig wetenschappelijk onderzoeksproject is het consortium van Hogeschool Zuyd, Hogeschool Rotterdam en het Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis opzoek naar een docent-onderzoeker (0,6 FTE).

*Achtergronden*


Het succesvol integreren van eHealth-innovaties, is van vitaal belang voor het verbeteren van de zorgkwaliteit en toegankelijkheid. Thuismeten is een van de innovaties die kan bijdragen aan een efficiëntere zorgverlening en een betere toegankelijkheid. Onderzoek toont aan dat digitaal thuis meten aanzienlijke voordelen biedt, waaronder een betere patiëntervaring, meer regie over het zorgproces, verbeterde veiligheid en kostenbesparingen. Juveniele dermatomyositis (JDM), een zeldzame ziekte bij kinderen, zou aanzienlijke voordelen kunnen halen uit thuismeten. Momenteel zijn monitoringtools zoals de Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) alleen beschikbaar in gespecialiseerde medische centra, wat frequente monitoring moeilijk maakt. Een veelbelovende ontwikkeling is het gebruik van AI-gebaseerde oplossingen voor real-time analyse van videobeelden. Deze ontwikkeling roept echter nog vragen op over acceptatie en betrouwbaarheid en inzetbaarheid. Daarom heeft Zuyd Hogeschool (Lectoraat Dataintelligence) samen met de kennis en praktijk partners Kinderfysiotherapie (Hogeschool Rotterdam), het Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis en eerstelijnskinderfysiotherapeuten tot de volgende vraagstelling gekomen: Hoe kunnen we de implementatie van betrouwbare AI-gebaseerde thuismetingsoplossingen bevorderen om meer frequente en consistente ziekte monitoring mogelijk te maken, de fysiotherapeutische behandeling te optimaliseren en daarmee de kwaliteit van zorg voor kinderen met JDM te verbeteren?


### **Wat ga je doen?**



Dit project wordt uitgevoerd op de kruising tussen zorg, innovatie en technologie waarbij de beantwoording van de vraag een duidelijke co-creatieaanpak vereist, nauwe betrokkenheid van zorgprofessionals en richtlijnen om de kansen en uitdagingen van thuismeten met behulp van AI in de praktijk te adresseren. Als onderzoeker in dit project ben jij de verbindende factor die bijdraagt aan het ontwikkelen van de applicatie (in samenwerking met professionals in de data-technologie), handelingskaders ontwikkeld voor de toepassing van de ontwikkelde AI applicatie (in samenwerking met kinderfysiotherapeuten) en het valideren en testen van het algoritme in de praktijk. Uiteindelijk moet dit project niet alleen leiden tot een applicatie voor de beroepspraktijk, maar ook leiden tot kaders voor het verantwoord en gewetensvol handelen met AI in de zorg. Het project betreft een periode van twee jaar en een promotie behoort tot de mogelijkheden.


### **Ben jij wie we zoeken?**



De geschikte kandidaat is een afgestudeerde kinderfysiotherapeut (of in de afrondende fase) met een affiniteit met data-technologie. Ervaring met klinische bewegingsanalyse aangevuld met basiskennis in programmeren (Python, R, Matlab) is een pre. De bereidheid om deze vaardigheden verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en implementatie is voorwaardelijk. Het verzorgen van scholing en onderwijs in het kader van het project kunnen tot de taken behoren. De geschikte kandidaat beschouwt zich als een teamspeler met uitstekende organisatie vaardigheden die energie krijgt van het samenwerken met diverse stakeholders uit verschillende domeinen.


### **Wat bieden we jou?**


* Contract voor bepaalde tijd (D4) voor de duur van het project (2 jaar);
* Afhankelijk van ervaring tussen de € 3.370 en maximaal € 5.019,73 bruto per maand (schaal 10 CAO HBO) bij een fulltime dienstverband;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 8,3% eindejaarsuitkering;
* Onze secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden omvatten uitstekende scholingsmogelijkheden;
* Een aantrekkelijke pensioenregeling via ABP;
* Bij interne kandidaten worden nadere afspraken gemaakt over de arbeidsvoorwaarden, bijvoorbeeld over de mogelijkheden van detachering;

Gezamenlijk zetten ons ruim 1.500 professionals zich dagelijks in voor ruim 65.000 werkgevers en ruim 1,5 miljoen werkenden om gezond, gemotiveerd en competent aan het werk te zijn en blijven. En dat levert een schat aan data op waar wij ons als afdeling Research & Development graag in vastbijten en deze vertalen in vernieuwende inzichten en datagedreven innovaties met inzet van AI.**



**Hoe ga je meer betekenen als Data Scientist**
-----------------------------------------------


Als Data Scientist bij HumanTotalCare denk je iedere dag vanuit jouw kennis en kunde mee over manieren waarop onze organisatie en professionals met behulp van data effectiever kunnen werken, en hoe we meer kunnen betekenen voor werknemers en werkgevers. Nu en straks.


Samen met je R&D collega’s en andere professionals uit de hele organisatie ontwikkel je concepten en ideeën die, via een innovatieproces met experimenten en pilots, tot schaalbare oplossingen voor de collega’s en klanten leiden. Dit doe je niet alleen en van achter je bureau, maar samen met je directe collega’s en in dialoog met de business.


Wij zijn er om in de praktijk belangrijk te zijn, en zetten hiervoor data en technologie samen met onze domeinkennis in. Denk aan het ontwikkelen van modellen voor beslisondersteuning in het verzuimproces, waarmee we het verschil maken door de juiste interventie op het juiste moment te initiëren. Of aan een datagedreven preventieproces waardoor een diagnose of prognose sneller gesteld kan worden en preventieve acties gerichter kunnen worden geadviseerd. Maar ook aan inzet van AI op de werkplek waarmee we onze professionals kunnen ondersteunen met efficiënte werkprocessen. We willen onze toegevoegde waarde meetbaar maken en monitoren onze KPI’s. Zo blijven we samen leren om onze processen en diensten te verbeteren.  



**Met wie ga je meer betekenen**
--------------------------------


Je wordt onderdeel van het veelzijdige R&D team, bestaande uit ongeveer 15 vaste collega’s. Met een mooie mix van consultants, research & business development, data scientists, project support medewerkers en machine learning engineers, aangevuld met een flexibele schil van onderzoeksassistenten, studenten en scientist practitioners ga jij impact maken.


Met een grote diversiteit aan kennis en kunde brengen wij data, wetenschap, technologie en praktijk bij elkaar. Dit doen we in nauwe samenwerking met collega’s van Business Intelligence, staf en IT. De organisatie weet ons goed te vinden en we hebben toegang tot een breed scala aan expertise van onze arbo-professionals. Van bedrijfsartsen tot arbeids- en organisatiedeskundigen en van ergonomen tot psychologen.



### **Wat is écht leuk aan deze baan**

* We hebben een schatkist vol relevante data. Van procesdata, verzuimdata, vragenlijsten tot vrije tekst of gebruik van onze platformen. Over onze dienstverlening heen, zowel inhoudelijke data rondom gezondheid van werknemers als procesinformatie en KPI’s (bijv. klanttevredenheid, omzet). Er is nog genoeg te ontginnen en veel ruimte voor jouw ideeën. Uiteraard binnen de kaders van de wet, privacy staat hoog bij ons in het vaandel.
* Jouw werk maakt echt verschil voor werkend Nederland. Wat je bedenkt kan ook echt in productie worden gebracht. Daarbij is er veel draagvlak binnen de organisatie voor wat je doet.
* Je wordt onderdeel van een hecht team, en elke dinsdag neem je deel aan de R&D dag met updates, demo’s of innovatiesessies.
* Je bepaalt voor een groot deel zelf waar je jouw energie in steekt en de meeste toegevoegde waarde ziet. Je krijgt veel autonomie om je werk in te richten zoals jij dat wilt. Zo vormt de functie zich naar jouw expertise en ambitie.

### **Is er ook iets minder leuk**


Het vakgebied is volop in ontwikkeling. Soms willen we te snel of moeten we eerst de data nog ontsluiten. Het is niet altijd een gespreid bedje en je bent nog aan het bouwen van jouw positie als Data Scientist binnen de organisatie. Maar met een flinke dosis doorzettingskracht en een goed verhaal kom je echt al een heel eind.



**Wat neem je mee**
-------------------


Nieuwsgierigheid en een beetje vakidiotie. Jij bent op de hoogte van de laatste inhoudelijke en technologische ontwikkelingen. En komt er weer wat interessants voorbij, dan maak jij je dit snel eigen. Je experimenteert met de mogelijke toepassing(en) hiervan. Je snapt de interactie tussen hardware en software en bedenkt graag dingen die echt een bijdrage leveren aan de praktijk. Daarbij heb je affiniteit met ons vakgebied van o.a. werk, gezondheid en gedragsverandering. En je weet hoe je jouw boodschap over de bühne moet krijgen. Complexe materie kun je uitleggen in de taal van je gesprekspartner, waar deze zich ook in de organisatie bevindt.


Verder vragen we het volgende:

* Een relevante universitaire opleiding (data/computer science of statistiek en methoden).
* Bij voorkeur minimaal 5 jaren relevante werkervaring als Data analist of Data Scientist en je hebt eerder gewerkt met grote hoeveelheden data, inclusief data cleaning.
* Je bent goed thuis in statistiek en onderzoeksmethoden.
* Je kunt uitstekend uit de voeten met Python, en liefst ook met een andere programmeertaal zoals R of Java.
* Je hebt ervaring met machine learning en bij voorkeur ook met andere data-analyse technieken, zoals simulatie, deep learning, en Natural Language Processing.
* Het is een pré als je ervaring hebt met infrastructuur en softwarearchitectuur die nodig zijn om modellen in softwareproductie te kunnen integreren (bijv. Docker, Kubernetes, microservices en REST API’s).
* De werkzaamheden en de documentatie zijn grotendeels in het Engels. Omdat je data vertaalt naar de business in onze organisatie, is het van belang dat je voldoende Nederlands spreekt en schrijft (B2).

Then we have an opportunity for you.

  



**Job Description**  

In the plastic packaging value chain, there is only limited information available on the plastics in that chain to assess circularity and recyclability goals, especially the use of post-consumer recyclates (PCR) in packaging.

  


Quality specifications, monitoring, and standardisation of materials are common in certain industries like chemistry and pharma but are, at this point, only in an infancy state in plastic waste management. A major challenge when it comes to mechanical recycling of plastics is that the quality of the material is not monitored throughout the whole process. Inline monitoring is however essential for predicting the final quality of PCR.

  


In the MoQuP-R project, we focus on the necessary quality monitoring tools and the application of existing models related to the prediction of recyclate quality in order to increase the use of PCR in packaging. In this project your responsibilities will entail:


* Review literature to identify potential inline analytical methods to monitor quality parameters.
* Adapt laboratory and/or offline analytical techniques to be used inline in polymer processing equipment.
* Propose and execute design changes to polymer processing equipment to enable inline measurements.
* Design experiments using polymer processing equipment and post-consumer plastics to apply and develop monitoring tools.
* Evaluate the different methods in relation to PCR quality.
* Manage a work package in the MoQuP-R project.
* Present your work at international conferences, MoQuP-R consortium meetings, and other events and write scientific papers for international peer-reviewed journals.
* Provide teaching assistance and/or supervision of researchers and students.

  




As a Postdoctoral Researcher you will work in the Circular Plastics team in the Faculty of Science and Engineering located at Brightlands Chemelot Campus in Geleen. You will become part of a young international research group, specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics with a strong polymer science background. Your will work together with Rudinei Fiorio on this exciting topic.

  


**Requirements**  

We expect you to have the following experience, knowledge, and skills:


* A PhD degree in mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, process analysis, mechatronics, or similar;
* Advanced skills in CAD and interfacing sensor data to analysis software (e.g. Python, Matlab, Simulink);
* Good knowledge on analytical techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, GCMS;
* Skills in polymer processing;
* Experience with industry collaborations is considered advantageous;
* Proficiency in both written and spoken English.

  




**What we offer**  

**As** **a Postdoctoral Researcher** **at the** **Faculty of Science & Engineering****, you will be employed by the most international university in the Netherlands, located in the beautiful city of Maastricht. In addition, we offer you:**


* Good employment conditions.

**De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie!**

**Wie zoeken wij?**

Voor ons hoofdkantoor in Amersfoort zoeken wij per direct een AI Solutions Developer.

In deze rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verkennen en implementeren van de mogelijkheden van generative AI, zoals ChatGPT, om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren.

Je hebt een relevante WO-opleiding afgerond of bijna afgerond, zoals Informatica of Data Science, en beschikt over aantoonbare kennis en interesse op het gebied van AI, machine learning en data-analyse. Daarnaast heb je sterke analytische vaardigheden en ben je in staat om complexe technische problemen op te lossen. Ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python, R of Java is een vereiste, evenals kennis van cloud computing en ervaring met platforms zoals AWS, Azure of Google Cloud.

Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief samen te werken in een team zijn van essentieel belang. Je bent proactief, leergierig en kunt goed omgaan met veranderingen en uitdagingen. Daarnaast heb je een sterke drive om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en ICT-management.

**Wat ga je doen?**

Deze functie is nieuw binnen Lab21, wat betekent dat je een grote invloed hebt op de invulling ervan. Je zult een onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren. Als Junior ICT Manager speel je een belangrijke rol bij het implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen binnen ons bedrijf. Je werkt nauw samen met verschillende teams om de behoeften van de organisatie in kaart te brengen en technologische oplossingen aan te dragen. Je analyseert en optimaliseert bestaande systemen en processen en identificeert kansen om AI-technologieën toe te passen.

**Plaats in de organisatie:**

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

Then we invite you to consider our offer.

  



**Job Description**  

In the plastic packaging value chain, there is only limited information available on the plastics in that chain to assess circularity and recyclability goals, especially the use of post-consumer recyclates (PCR) in packaging.

  


Quality specifications, monitoring, and standardisation of materials are common in certain industries like chemistry and pharma but are, at this point, only in an infancy state in plastic waste management. A major challenge when it comes to mechanical recycling of plastics is that the quality of the material is not monitored throughout the whole process. Inline monitoring is however essential for predicting the final quality of PCR.

  


In the MoQuP-R project, we focus on the necessary quality monitoring tools and the application of existing models related to the prediction of recyclate quality in order to increase the use of PCR in packaging. In this project, your responsibilities will entail:


* Review literature to identify relevant quality parameters in mechanical recycling of plastics.
* Support the adaptation of laboratory and/or offline analytical techniques to be used inline in polymer processing equipment.
* Support the realisation of changes to polymer processing equipment to enable inline measurements during extrusion.
* Develop a new inline rheometer aiming to identify fluctuations in the properties of the material during recycling.
* Design and perform experiments using polymer processing equipment and post-consumer plastics to apply and develop monitoring tools.
* Analyse the experimental data from the experiments related to PCR quality and propose predictive models.
* Present your work at international conferences, MoQuP-R consortium meetings, and other events and write scientific papers for international peer-reviewed journals.
* Provide teaching assistance and/or supervision of students.

  




As a PhD Candidate, you will work in the Circular Plastics team in the Faculty of Science and Engineering located at Brightlands Chemelot Campus in Geleen. You will become part of a young international research group, specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics with a strong polymer science background. You will be guided by Rudinei Fiorio and supported by other experts in the Circular Plastics team on this exciting topic.

  


**Requirements**  

We expect you to have the following experience, knowledge, and skills:


* A MSc degree in mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, polymer science, chemical engineering, chemistry, or similar;
* Good knowledge on analytical techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, GCMS;
* Skills in polymer processing;
* Good skills in data analysis software (e.g. Python (preferred), Matlab, Simulink);
* Proficiency in both written and spoken English.

  




**What we offer**  

**As a PhD candidate at the** **Faculty of Science & Engineering****, you will be employed by the most international university in the Netherlands, located in the beautiful city of Maastricht. In addition, we offer you:**

***Explore groundbreaking PFAS removal using foam in wastewater treatment. Join TU Delft's PhD project and shape future environmental solutions.***


Job description


Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a diverse group of compounds that have become widespread pollutants in the (aqueous) environment. To prevent further PFAS contamination, the development of cost- and energy-efficient treatment technologies for contaminated waters is crucial.



PFAS, particularly the group of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA), are often surface-active molecules that can be removed from water by adsorption to air bubbles and subsequent accumulation in foam, which is exploited in a technology called foam fractionation. However, the foam fractionation process is still relatively energy-intensive and expensive, due to the need for high aeration rates.



This PhD project aims to investigate whether PFAS removal with foam can be integrated into existing wastewater treatment technologies, particularly the activated sludge (AS) process. Aeration is an integral part of AS treatment, and foam formation is often observed when PFAS-contaminated water types are treated. However, the three-phase nature of the foam/sludge process complicates our understanding of the system, and incorporating physicochemical removal of PFAS may negatively affect the biological nutrient removal in the reactor.



This project will combine lab experiments assessing the impact of various process variables on the removal of PFAS and nutrients in a combined system, with full scale monitoring of an existing AS plant where foam removal will be implemented. The project may also include investigations of destructive technologies for handling the PFAS-enriched foam.


Requirements


As a good candidate, you will have the following 'Need-to-haves':


* MSc in Chemical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Water Technology, or a closely related field

* Laboratory experience proven by lab courses, internships or other previous work
* Excellent spoken and written English; English Proficiency Test IELTS of 7.0 (scores of at least 6.5 in all sections) or TOEFL of 100 (scores of at least 2.1 for all sections).


and hopefully the following 'Nice-to-haves':


* Experience in design and/or operation of lab-scale reactors proven by previous practical or research projects
* Experience in analytical chemistry, specifically LC-MS/MS or LC-HRMS
* R, Python, Matlab, or equivalent programming skills

Het lectoraat Leren met ict bij de Academie Educatie van de HAN, is de centrale kennispartner in het iXperium Centre of Expertise Leren met ict (iXperium), een netwerkorganisatie van lectoraat, lerarenopleidingen, primair en voortgezet onderwijs, mbo en hbo. Het kernteam bestaat uit ongeveer 20 personen; een lector en twee associate lectoren, een programmamanager, (senior) onderzoekers, projectleiders, ict-specialisten en projectondersteuners. De thuisbasis van het kernteam is de HAN Campus in Nijmegen, maar werkzaamheden vinden ook plaats op de HAN campus in Arnhem en uiteraard ook in het onderwijswerkveld.
  
  

In het iXperium werken onderzoekers, leraren, lerarenopleiders, ict-experts, studenten en andere professionals uit het onderwijs samen aan evidence informed praktijkontwikkeling. De gezamenlijke, richtinggevende visie luidt: ‘leren is een leven lang gepersonaliseerd leren in een door technologie ondersteunde, sociale, leeromgeving’. Het onderzoeksprogramma kent drie programmalijnen:
  
  

gepersonaliseerd leren met ict;
  
de organisatie van gepersonaliseerd leren met ict op micro-, meso- en macroniveau;
  
opleiden in ict-geletterdheid voor leren, leven en werken.

We optimize credit-risk models and processes to solve complex problems for leading banks and financial institutions. Here are some examples of the type of work we do:
  

  

1. Developing a new Advanced Internal Rating-Based Approach (AIRB) credit risk model for the Mortgages portfolio of a G-SIB
  

  

2. Leading the end-to-end implementation of a new credit decisioning process
  

  

3. Orchestrating complex regulatory programs in the area of credit risk (e.g. IFRS9)

De opleiding


De opleiding Applied Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (ADS&AI) is voor studenten die begrijpen dat, naast technische en niet-technische competenties, de ontwikkelde AI oplossingen ook een verantwoordelijkheid met zich meebrengen (responsible AI).


We staan als opleiding voor een open en respectvolle leeromgeving en vinden het belangrijk dat onze studenten met plezier en vertrouwen hun studie volgen. Er is gekozen voor een geïntegreerd onderwijsconcept waarbij de ontwikkelingsgerichtheid van de student centraal staat. Dat betekent dat de student gericht wordt opgeleid aan de hand van onze zes competenties (responsible technology, drie technische competenties en twee professionele competenties). Studenten ontvangen regelmatig feedback en mogen fouten maken. Vertrouwen opbouwen in hun eigen kunnen is iets wat we de studenten mee willen geven.


We leren studenten om oplossingen en toepassingen voor uiteenlopende stakeholders te onderzoeken, te ontwerpen en te bouwen. De studenten worden niet alleen technisch goed onderlegd, ze leren ook te adviseren en communiceren over inzichten en oplossingen. Het onderwijs richt zich voornamelijk op projecten waarbij we zo dicht mogelijk de praktijk proberen te benaderen. Dit doen we in het 1e studiejaar aan de hand van vier thema’s: data driven society, smart & social city, data driven logistics en data supported healthcare. Er wordt vooral met echte opdrachtgevers gewerkt.

**Your job**
------------


How the overturning circulation of the Mediterranean Sea responds to variations in forcing (tectonics and climate) is a fundamental question that potentially has global significance given that Mediterranean circulation has elements in common with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. It is also a highly relevant question for the countries bordering the sea in view of our warming climate.


In this NWO (Dutch Research Council)-funded project we will exploit the paleoceanographical record of the late Quaternary which provides an exceptional dataset on e.g. water properties, intensity of intermediate and deep-water formation and strait flow. You will design and execute experiments with dynamic box models and evaluate their results using the available data. The geometrically simple box model is chosen because it can be run following the evolution of circulation and water properties through time, thus doing justice to the transient nature of the processes at play. The analysis will focus on the role of:


* the Strait of Sicily;
* the properties of the inflowing waters; and
* sea-level variation.


You will be based at the department of Earth Sciences where you will be part of a vibrant PhD community and where expertise in both paleoceanography/paleoclimate and numerical modelling is amply available.


A personalised training programme will be set up, reflecting your training needs and career objectives. About 20% of your time will be dedicated to this training component, which includes training on the job in assisting in the Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes of the department.


**Your qualities**
------------------


You must have completed your MSc degree in Earth Sciences, Physical Oceanography, or a related discipline by the time the position starts. We seek candidates that have a keen interest in working on the interface between marine geology and physical oceanography. The ideal candidate:


* has knowledge of and experience with numerical modelling applied to Earth’s processes, using programming languages such as Python, MATLAB or R;
* has a solid basis in physics - specific knowledge regarding physical oceanography or (geophysical) fluid mechanics is an asset;
* is trained in the concepts of sedimentary geology required for this project: aspects of sedimentology, stratigraphy and paleoceanography;
* is willing and able to interact with specialists in the various disciplines that come together in this project.


Due to the international character of our department, good command of spoken and written English is essential. We highly encourage applicants from all members of our community and of diverse backgrounds to join us.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for one year, with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period;
* a working week of 38 hours and a gross monthly salary between €2,770 and €3,539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research are recruiting a:

 **Postdoc position Pharmacometrics for anti-infective pharmacology and pandemic preparedness (2 positions available)**  

**Vacancy number: 15017**


The Division of Systems Pharmacology and Pharmacy (SPP) of the Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR) aims to develop quantitative precision medicine approaches to predict variation in treatment response and enhance translational drug development strategies. Our ambition is to impact development of personalized treatment strategies and innovative translational drug development through integration with clinical data, including patient data. We develop new methodological advances at the interface of quantitative systems- and clinical pharmacology/pharmacometrics and other disciplines such as innovative experimental disease models, emerging biomarker technologies, state-of-the art biophysical tools, and advanced statistical/ ML/ AI-approaches.

**Project description**  

We have two postdoc positions available within the ZonMW-funded project “PPP-COMPUTE: A Pandemic Pharmacology Platform for model-based optimization of anti-infectives”.


In PPP-COMPUTE we aim to establish a versatile computational platform to facilitate early clinical development of novel anti-infective treatments, with a focus on viral and bacterial pathogens, to support efficient pandemic drug development activities. During a pandemic there exists a need for rapid evaluation of potential therapeutic modalities. Tools to rapidly predict treatment strategies and optimize the design of clinical trials for novel anti-infectives agents against emerging pathogens are therefore essential. The ability to generate such clinical predictions relies on effective integration of data concerning the relationship between (expected) concentrations of the therapeutic agent (pharmacokinetics, PK) in patients and the associated effects on pathogen clearance (pharmacodynamics, PD).


The PPP-COMPUTE platform will consist of several integrated computational pharmacological mechanism-based PK/PD models to rapidly evaluate and predict optimal (combination) treatment strategies (e.g., dosing schedules) and clinical trial designs for potential therapeutic agents, building on established models, and experimental and clinical data already available in the public domain. The framework will be implemented as a public web-application. PPP-COMPUTE will involve clinical stakeholders through collaborating with the recently established INFECT-NL consortium, which aims to establish key infrastructure for early clinical trials of anti-infectives. Finally, the developed modeling framework may be integrated with epidemiological mathematical models which study the effect of novel therapeutic interventions on pathogen transmission dynamics on a population level.


For the available two postdoc positions, we are ideally seeking one individual with a strong track record in pharmacometric and ideally mechanism-based modeling, while for the second position we seek a candidate with a rack record in development of web-applications (R/Shiny) and handling large scale data, in addition to knowledge of pharmacometric/PKPD modeling.

**Key responsibilities**

* Conduct original research in the area of translational pharmacology of anti-infectives in the context of pandemic preparedness;
* Develop and implement mechanism-based and population PK/PD based mathematical models for anti-infectives to support translation between preclinical and clinical data of anti-infective agents;
* Develop a user-friendly web-applications (R/Shiny) which implement the developed models;
* Engage in collaborative research within the project;
* Publish scientific articles at international peer-review journals;
* Presentation of results internally and at (inter-) national conferences;
* Possible support of education activities in the bachelor and master programs of biopharmaceutical sciences.

**Selection Criteria**

* PhD degree in the area of quantitative pharmacology, pharmacometrics or systems pharmacology, or a related (quantitative) discipline;
* Strong experience with modelling approaches in pharmacometrics and/or systems pharmacology applied to clinical and/or preclinical data;
* Experience in R programming and modelling software tools such as NONMEM, Monolix, or nlmixr;
* Experience with viral dynamic modelling is desirable;
* Knowledge of anti-infectives and infectious diseases;
* Strong communication and writing skills;
* Ability to work independently as well as part of a team;
* Excellent organisational and planning skills;
* Full proficiency in English;
* Enthusiastic, highly motivated, and independent thinker.

---------------------------------------



Directie Democratie en Bestuur  

Een betrouwbare en goed functionerende democratie, daarvoor zetten wij ons als directie Democratie en Bestuur in. We werken aan versterking van de band tussen kiezers en gekozenen, een betere toerusting en ondersteuning van politieke ambtsdragers en een weerbaar effectief bestuur. Als directie hebben we een brede sociaal-maatschappelijke oriëntatie en dragen bij aan de oplossing van spanningen, dilemma’s en actuele vraagstukken op het snijvlak van politiek, bestuur en samenleving. De directie bestaat uit vier afdelingen; Democratie, Inrichting Openbaar Bestuur, Ondersteuning Bestuur en Politieke Ambtsdragers en Weerbaarheid, met daarbinnen onder andere het programma Slavernijverleden en het Nationaal Programma Leefbaarheid en Veiligheid.  

Ons werk speelt zich af in het hart van de democratie. Je komt te werken in een dynamische omgeving waar we samen hard werken en topkwaliteit willen leveren. Werkplezier en je ontwikkeling staan daarin centraal. We vinden diversiteit belangrijk. Verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en inzichten zorgen ervoor dat we beter aansluiten bij de behoeften uit de samenleving.  

  

Afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur  

De nieuwe afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur levert een bijdrage aan de uitvoering van de missie en visie van de directie D&B, onder meer door de informatiepositie van het decentraal bestuur op complexe opgaven te vergroten en op projectmatige wijze (uitvoerings)beleid en werkvormen te ontwikkelen die goed verbonden zijn met de praktijk van het decentraal bestuur. Op korte termijn is de opgave van de afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur om de methodiek van Zicht op Ondermijning structureel te borgen. De afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur is verantwoordelijk voor de kwaliteit van de 'Zicht op-methode' en het organiseren, uitbreiden en onderhouden van het brede samenwerkingsverband en het maken van afspraken met interne en externe netwerkpartners.  

Om de meerwaarde van de 'Zicht-op methode' voor bredere inzet binnen het decentraal bestuur te vergroten werkt de afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur aan bewustwording rond (ondermijnings)risico's; versterking van de informatiepositie van decentraal bestuur (o.a. via de Zicht-op methode); het aanreiken van handelingsperspectief; het ontwikkelen van een kennis en leernetwerk en expertpool; ontwikkeling van monitoring en rapportage en onderzoek ten behoeve van de bestuurlijk-preventieve aanpak vanuit het decentraal bestuur.



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.

The Faculty of Science and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) are looking for:

**PhD candidate | Environmental impact assessment of pollution at the ecosystem level (0.8-1.0 fte)**

**Vacancy number: (14994)**


**Background**


The freshwater system and its adjacent ecosystems host countless species because of their need of water. These are the earths’ natural capital and drivers of many ecosystem services we humans depend on. At the same time, the presence and effects of anthropogenic stress in the aquatic environment are multitude and ubiquitous. These include the omnipresence of chemical pollution such as the use of agricultural chemicals.


To relatively quickly assess the impacts of chemicals a standard risk assessment framework is in place. While valuable, the frameworks often lacks ecological realism. Researchers from Leiden University therefore experiment in outdoor freshwater experimental systems with natural food webs such as the “Levend Lab” (EN: “Living Lab”, https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/livinglab) to identify how biodiversity responds to the impacts of pesticides, fertilizers, invasive species and nanomaterials.


Using ecological theory, a large array of different experimental and statistical analytical methods are currently in practice to perform and analyze such experiments. The key challenge for the PhD candidate is to test these different forms of experimental and statistical analytical methods to identify stressor - ecosystem function relationships. The research will likely entail measuring different forms of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functionality followed by statistical modelling to infer causality of stressor impacts and their propagation through the ecosystem.


We invite prospective candidates to unravel the intricate network of species interactions between each other and their environment. The candidate will use new analytical methods and develops models and interpretation scenarios to identify how pollution impacts species and their role in ecosystem functionality.

**Key tasks:**

* *Perform* mesocosm pollution experiments in the ‘Levend Lab’ facility of Leiden University
* *Further develop* and test different types of statistical analyses at the community to ecosystem level
* *Advance* ecological theory by identifying the anthropological and natural drivers of species and their roles in ecosystems

**Selection criteria:**

* You should have an M.Sc. in a relevant field (environmental science, biology, ecology and/or ecotoxicology), but we also consider candidates from other related scientific fields.
* Experience with experimental field and laboratory skills and (aquatic) organism identifications are highly valued
* Strong background and interest in statistical analyses, data management, visualization and coding skills (in R, but Python also applies) is highly valued.
* You must be proficient in spoken and written English.
* You are a team player and have a collaborative attitude.


**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,800 staff and almost 6,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 150 FTE (including postdocs and PhD candidates) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

We offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 4 years based on performance. Salary ranges from € 2.770 gross per month in the first year to € 3.539 gross per month in the fourth year based on a full-time position (pay scale P in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities).


Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development and sabbatical leave. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break.


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website. Female researchers are also welcomed to join the Researchers In Science for Equality network of the Faculty if Science (rise.nu).

 **Information**  

Enquiries can be made to Dr. S. Henrik Barmentlo, s.h.barmentlo@cml.leidenuniv.nl


**Applications**  

Please submit your application via the online recruitment system, via the blue button at the top or bottom of this page. **Applications received via e-mail will not be taken into consideration**. Please ensure that you upload the following additional documents quoting the vacancy number:

* CV

You will also be invited to develop your personal learning development plan, making use of the offered training courses.

Gezamenlijk zetten ons ruim 1.500 professionals zich dagelijks in voor ruim 65.000 werkgevers en ruim 1,5 miljoen werkenden om gezond, gemotiveerd en competent aan het werk te zijn en blijven. En dat levert een schat aan data op waar wij ons als afdeling Research & Development graag in vastbijten en deze vertalen in vernieuwende inzichten en datagedreven innovaties met inzet van AI.**



**Hoe ga je meer betekenen als Data Scientist**
-----------------------------------------------


Als Data Scientist bij HumanTotalCare denk je iedere dag vanuit jouw kennis en kunde mee over manieren waarop onze organisatie en professionals met behulp van data effectiever kunnen werken, en hoe we meer kunnen betekenen voor werknemers en werkgevers. Nu en straks.


Samen met je R&D collega’s en andere professionals uit de hele organisatie ontwikkel je concepten en ideeën die, via een innovatieproces met experimenten en pilots, tot schaalbare oplossingen voor de collega’s en klanten leiden. Dit doe je niet alleen en van achter je bureau, maar samen met je directe collega’s en in dialoog met de business.


Wij zijn er om in de praktijk belangrijk te zijn, en zetten hiervoor data en technologie samen met onze domeinkennis in. Denk aan het ontwikkelen van modellen voor beslisondersteuning in het verzuimproces, waarmee we het verschil maken door de juiste interventie op het juiste moment te initiëren. Of aan een datagedreven preventieproces waardoor een diagnose of prognose sneller gesteld kan worden en preventieve acties gerichter kunnen worden geadviseerd. Maar ook aan inzet van AI op de werkplek waarmee we onze professionals kunnen ondersteunen met efficiënte werkprocessen. We willen onze toegevoegde waarde meetbaar maken en monitoren onze KPI’s. Zo blijven we samen leren om onze processen en diensten te verbeteren.  



**Met wie ga je meer betekenen**
--------------------------------


Je wordt onderdeel van het veelzijdige R&D team, bestaande uit ongeveer 15 vaste collega’s. Met een mooie mix van consultants, research & business development, data scientists, project support medewerkers en machine learning engineers, aangevuld met een flexibele schil van onderzoeksassistenten, studenten en scientist practitioners ga jij impact maken.


Met een grote diversiteit aan kennis en kunde brengen wij data, wetenschap, technologie en praktijk bij elkaar. Dit doen we in nauwe samenwerking met collega’s van Business Intelligence, staf en IT. De organisatie weet ons goed te vinden en we hebben toegang tot een breed scala aan expertise van onze arbo-professionals. Van bedrijfsartsen tot arbeids- en organisatiedeskundigen en van ergonomen tot psychologen.



### **Wat is écht leuk aan deze baan**

* We hebben een schatkist vol relevante data. Van procesdata, verzuimdata, vragenlijsten tot vrije tekst of gebruik van onze platformen. Over onze dienstverlening heen, zowel inhoudelijke data rondom gezondheid van werknemers als procesinformatie en KPI’s (bijv. klanttevredenheid, omzet). Er is nog genoeg te ontginnen en veel ruimte voor jouw ideeën. Uiteraard binnen de kaders van de wet, privacy staat hoog bij ons in het vaandel.
* Jouw werk maakt echt verschil voor werkend Nederland. Wat je bedenkt kan ook echt in productie worden gebracht. Daarbij is er veel draagvlak binnen de organisatie voor wat je doet.
* Je wordt onderdeel van een hecht team, en elke dinsdag neem je deel aan de R&D dag met updates, demo’s of innovatiesessies.
* Je bepaalt voor een groot deel zelf waar je jouw energie in steekt en de meeste toegevoegde waarde ziet. Je krijgt veel autonomie om je werk in te richten zoals jij dat wilt. Zo vormt de functie zich naar jouw expertise en ambitie.

### **Is er ook iets minder leuk**


Het vakgebied is volop in ontwikkeling. Soms willen we te snel of moeten we eerst de data nog ontsluiten. Het is niet altijd een gespreid bedje en je bent nog aan het bouwen van jouw positie als Data Scientist binnen de organisatie. Maar met een flinke dosis doorzettingskracht en een goed verhaal kom je echt al een heel eind.



**Wat neem je mee**
-------------------


Nieuwsgierigheid en een beetje vakidiotie. Jij bent op de hoogte van de laatste inhoudelijke en technologische ontwikkelingen. En komt er weer wat interessants voorbij, dan maak jij je dit snel eigen. Je experimenteert met de mogelijke toepassing(en) hiervan. Je snapt de interactie tussen hardware en software en bedenkt graag dingen die echt een bijdrage leveren aan de praktijk. Daarbij heb je affiniteit met ons vakgebied van o.a. werk, gezondheid en gedragsverandering. En je weet hoe je jouw boodschap over de bühne moet krijgen. Complexe materie kun je uitleggen in de taal van je gesprekspartner, waar deze zich ook in de organisatie bevindt.


Verder vragen we het volgende:

* Een relevante universitaire opleiding (data/computer science of statistiek en methoden).
* Bij voorkeur minimaal 5 jaren relevante werkervaring als Data analist of Data Scientist en je hebt eerder gewerkt met grote hoeveelheden data, inclusief data cleaning.
* Je bent goed thuis in statistiek en onderzoeksmethoden.
* Je kunt uitstekend uit de voeten met Python, en liefst ook met een andere programmeertaal zoals R of Java.
* Je hebt ervaring met machine learning en bij voorkeur ook met andere data-analyse technieken, zoals simulatie, deep learning, en Natural Language Processing.
* Het is een pré als je ervaring hebt met infrastructuur en softwarearchitectuur die nodig zijn om modellen in softwareproductie te kunnen integreren (bijv. Docker, Kubernetes, microservices en REST API’s).
* De werkzaamheden en de documentatie zijn grotendeels in het Engels. Omdat je data vertaalt naar de business in onze organisatie, is het van belang dat je voldoende Nederlands spreekt en schrijft (B2).

**Wat krijg je ervoor terug**
-----------------------------


Als HumanTotalCare zetten we ons in voor een gezond, gemotiveerd en competent werkend Nederland. Vanuit onze merken adviseren en ondersteunen we werkgevers en werkenden gedurende hun hele werkzame leven. Zo zijn we van betekenis voor werkenden, organisaties en onze maatschappij. En wat we naar buiten beloven, doen we ook intern. We bieden je dan ook:

* **Een open, informele werksfeer.** We doen het voor, door en met elkaar.

**De energietransitie is onmogelijk zonder jou als Senior Full Stack Python Developer**  

De energietransitie zorgt ervoor dat we steeds meer aanvragen krijgen voor het aansluiten van grootverbruikers en dat bestaande klanten hun gecontracteerde vermogen willen ophogen. Het elektriciteitsnet wordt hierdoor steeds meer belast waardoor het niet meer vanzelfsprekend is dat een klant aangesloten kan worden. In het intakeproces van een netbeheerder wordt getoetst of de klant ingepast kan worden in het net. Om de ruimte op het net beter te benutten worden er continue verbeteringen doorgevoerd om zoveel mogelijk klanten aan te sluiten. Het energienet van de toekomst maken we voor iedereen, mét iedereen. En als Senior Software Developer werk jij hieraan mee. Zo ben jij bezig met het:

* Zorgen voor goede documentatie van de ontwikkelde oplossingen.

Wist je dat we bij Alliander uit verschillende bedrijven bestaan? Samen met Liander, Qirion, Qterra, Dep, Firan en Entrnce ontwikkelen én beheren we het energienet voor miljoenen inwoners van Nederland. En met de huidige energietransitie is dat hard werken. Dat doen we met de hulp van een grote club vakmensen. Dankzij deze talenten hebben wij het volste vertrouwen in de energietoekomst van Nederland. Samen met jou maken wij dat mogelijk.  

  

En jij gaat dat doen bij ons bedrijfsonderdeel Liander. Hier ben jij medeverantwoordelijk voor het beheer en onderhoud van energienetten zoals elektriciteit en gas. Dat regel je met zo’n 3.000 collega’s. Zo leveren wij energie aan huishoudens, bedrijven en andere klanten.  

  

Slimme ontwerpen maken kan alleen als jij genoeg energie hebt. En de juiste werkomgeving geeft jou dat. Als Senior Full Stack Python Developer werk je binnen het team Inzicht in Omgeving, middels een DevOps-methodologie, nauw samen met de ontwikkelaars om een nieuwe applicatie te bouwen binnen het Amazon Web Services (AWS)-platform. Je bent medeverantwoordelijk voor het ontwerpen, implementeren en onderhouden van een schaalbare, betrouwbare en veilige applicatie conform architectuur die voldoet aan de vereisten van onze energieprojecten. Samen met je collega’s speel je een belangrijke rol in het hele ontwikkelingsproces, van het definiëren van de technische oplossing tot het leveren van hoogwaardige code en het bieden van technische begeleiding binnen het team. Als team werk je samen met de Solution Architect om de functionele en non-functionele vereisten te begrijpen en te vertalen naar technische specificaties.


Wij zijn de afgelopen maanden gestart met het opnieuw opzetten van onze applicatie op AWS Lambda met een onderliggende RDS Postgres database en een Angular Front-end. Tegelijkertijd willen we onze gebruikers een compleet nieuwe gebruikersreis bieden. Naast onze reguliere gebruikers zijn er veel applicaties en teams binnen Alliander afhankelijk van onze data. Onze nieuw te ontwerpen API's moeten het mogelijk maken voor deze afnemers om onze data op een efficiënte manier te consumeren. Het bestaande scrumteam bestaat op dit moment uit een Product Owner, Scrum Master, meerdere data- en software engineers, een User Experience designer en een Business Analist.

 **De organisatie**  

Toeslagen  

Dienst Toeslagen is een zelfstandige, publieke dienstverlener, onderdeel van het ministerie van Financiën. We maken vitale voorzieningen als de huur, de zorgverzekering en de zorg voor kinderen voor iedereen betaalbaar. Maar als je er goed over nadenkt, gaat ons werk over veel meer dan alleen het uitkeren van een maandelijks voorschot aan mensen die daar recht op hebben. Wij zorgen ervoor dat mensen mee kunnen doen in de maatschappij. Zonder dat ze zich zorgen hoeven te maken of ze deze maand de huur, de kinderopvang of de zorgverzekering of de zorg voor hun kinderen nog kunnen betalen. Mensen helpen die ons hard nodig hebben, dat is waar we het voor doen. Door onze kennis in te zetten en -vooral- ons te blijven verplaatsen in de mensen om wie het gaat. Door hun problemen, twijfels en uitdagingen zo goed mogelijk te doorgronden.


Binnen Dienst Toeslagen heeft de Uitvoeringsorganisatie Herstel Toeslagen een specifieke, tijdelijke opdracht: gedupeerde ouders erkenning bieden en ruimhartig herstellen voor het onrecht  

dat hen is aangedaan rondom kinderopvangtoeslag.


Met elkaar en met de buitenwereld bouwen we aan Dienst Toeslagen. De motivatie om te leren van gemaakte fouten is in de hele organisatie voelbaar. Iedere dag opnieuw proberen we Dienst Toeslagen nog beter te laten aansluiten bij wat de samenleving vraagt. Zodat iedereen in Nederland, wie je ook bent en wat je persoonlijke situatie ook is, kan meedoen.

Als projectleider vorm je een belangrijke schakel in de optimale samenhang tussen de inlichtingen- en bedrijfsprocessen en IT en werk je aan de voortdurende verbetering hiervan. Jij brengt vernieuwing en realiserend vermogen in een omgeving die voortdurend in beweging is. De projectleider zal worden belast met alle aspecten van de uitvoering van IV- en ICT-projecten. Dit loopt van het initiëren, definiëren, ontwerpen en voorbereiden van deze projecten, via het daadwerkelijk leiden van (complexe) projecten en het implementeren en realiseren van de plannen, tot het verzorgen van nazorg en het afsluiten van projecten. Het betreft projecten van variërende omvang.  

Je geeft op effectieve en transparante wijze leiding aan multidisciplinaire teams en houdt toezicht op werk van derden. Jouw drijfveer is om de MIVD nieuwe mogelijkheden te bieden om de dienst op kortere en middellange termijn effectiever te maken. Ook benut jij kansen die zich aandienen door technologische ontwikkelingen, bijvoorbeeld door innovatie te stimuleren. Met je solide achtergrond ben je in staat verschillende rollen te vervullen, bijvoorbeeld die van adviseur, (deel)projectleider, kwaliteitsbewaker of system integrator.  

Als persoon ben je nieuwsgierig en zoek je naar de laatste mogelijkheden in de markt en luister je naar ideeën uit de eigen organisatie. Jij weet deze op waarde te schatten en kansen te identificeren alsook de strategische en de praktische implicaties van verbeteringen duidelijk voor het voetlicht te brengen. Je treedt daarbij op als verbinder tussen de verschillende technische specialisten, de (DevOps) teams en de vertegenwoordigers van de gebruikersorganisatie. Dit alles met oog voor de uitdagingen van vandaag en de ambities van de toekomst.



Deze functie is geplaatst in onze locatie Eibergen, waar je veel samenwerkt in een groeiend team met een brede taak. Het accent ligt binnen het team op netwerk- server- en werkplek-beheer en technisch en functioneel applicatiebeheer, binnen een complexe omgeving met specifieke systemen / applicaties. Omdat het een kleinere locatie met beperkte specialistische functies betreft wordt van je verwacht dat je het geen probleem vindt om regelmatig de inhoud in te duiken, vooral in de opstartfase van een project. Je werkt daarbij onder andere samen met een analist, een informatiebeveiligings-expert en ICT-beheerders. Met de servicemanager stem je de overdracht vanuit project naar beheer af. Je onderhoudt een nauwe band met je collega-projectleiders en andere collega’s die op een andere locatie werkzaam zijn, onder andere over de werkwijze rond projecten.



We zijn het Scaled Agile Framwork (SAFe) aan het implementeren en je denkt met ons mee over de rol die de projectleider hierin in de toekomst heeft. Dit kan betekenen dat je rol er anders uit komt te zien met de jaren.


* Je bent een echte kartrekker. Je hebt aantoonbare ervaring in het aansturen van projectteams en je haalt er energie uit om met collega’s op een prettige wijze resultaat neer te zetten, met de focus op tijd en kwaliteit, en daarin de leidende rol te pakken.
* Je bent vaardig in het ontwikkelen, uitdragen en verdedigen van projectresultaten, producten en diensten;
* Je hebt kennis van zowel klassieke methoden en technieken voor projectmanagement alsmede van agile werkwijzen zoals SAFe, DevOps en AgilePM;
* Je hebt brede kennis van de bedrijfsprocessen en ICT-ontwikkelingen en -innovaties, waaronder big data ontwikkelingen;
* Je weet klantbehoeften te identificeren, gestructureerd weer te geven en deze door te vertalen naar oplossingsrichtingen;
* Je hebt ervaring met inzet van IT in operationele (defensie-) omstandigheden of hebt hier affiniteit mee;
* Je laat je niet snel uit het veld slaan en bent gewend om met veel verschillende belangen en partijen samen te werken.

Bijzonderheden
--------------


  
De functie geeft je beperkingen en verplichtingen in de vrijheid van handelen, zowel professioneel als in de privésfeer.  

Wees terughoudend met het bekendmaken dat je voor de MIVD wilt werken. Dit levert mogelijk risico’s voor je op.



De functie leent zich niet voor thuiswerken i.v.m. het gerubriceerde karakter van de informatieverwerking.



Je bent door de aard van de werkzaamheden en je verantwoordelijkheden indien nodig inzetbaar buiten de normale kantooruren.



Een veiligheidsonderzoek op niveau A+, eventueel een psychologisch onderzoek, het opvragen van referenties en online screening zijn onderdeel van de sollicitatieprocedure.  

Om in aanmerking te komen voor een functie bij de MIVD dient u de Nederlandse nationaliteit te hebben en (in principe) de afgelopen tien jaar in Nederland hebben gewoond. Ook aan je eventuele partner en andere mensen in je omgeving worden bepaalde eisen gesteld.



Houd er rekening mee dat de selectieprocedure, inclusief het veiligheidsonderzoek, ongeveer vijf maanden in beslag kan nemen.

**Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD)**
-------------------------------------------------------



De Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD) is onderdeel van het ministerie van Defensie. De dienst ondersteunt bij het gereedstellen van de eenheden en bij militaire missies en vredesoperaties. Hiervoor verwerven we wereldwijd inlichtingen en veiligheidsinformatie op strategisch, tactisch en operationeel niveau. De MIVD speelt zo een cruciale rol bij de besluitvorming door de militaire leiding en de politieke top.



Werk je bij de MIVD, dan doe je werk dat er echt toe doet. Je draagt bij aan het beschermen van de Nederlandse belangen en de nationale veiligheid. Bovendien werk je in een zeer dynamische omgeving. We doen er alles aan om te zorgen dat je op jouw vakgebied up-to-date blijft, bijvoorbeeld door middel van opleidingen en kennisuitwisseling met onze partnerdiensten.



Omdat je bij de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdienst werkt en met gevoelige informatie te maken krijgt, kun je de inhoud van je werk niet met je vrienden en familie bespreken. Maar wel met je collega’s. Daarom bouw je een bijzondere band op met hen. Er heerst een sterke onderlinge verbondenheid die er mede voor zorgt dat de meeste mensen lang bij de organisatie blijven werken. En allemaal werken we aan hetzelfde doel: de fysieke en digitale veiligheid van 17 miljoen Nederlanders.

**Why?**

Every swipe, every like, every TikTok video we upload, every Zoom call we have, every Netflix video we watch, or everything we buy online is all processed and depends on… data centers. However, these data centers consume large amounts of energy due to the underlying technology we use every day all day.

**How?**

We have developed an AI-based analytics platform that captures the entire data center (DC) infrastructure—""from roof to room""—to bring the whole DC into a more optimal state. This platform saves energy, water, and scope 3 emissions while increasing reliability and sustainability in data centers across countries like Germany, France, the UK, Australia, and The Netherlands.

As such, this role represents a unique opportunity to have a broad impact on our organization and to contribute significantly to our technological evolution.

Job requirements

* Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science , Mathematics or a Physics related field with abundant ML experience.
* 5+ years of proven experience as a Data Scientist, preferably in a SaaS product domain.

Als Consultant Informatiemanagement adviseer je klanten over het effectief en verantwoord inzetten van hun informatievoorziening en hoe deze te organiseren en beheersen. Jij helpt klanten hun IT zo in te richten en strategisch te sturen dat het maximaal bijdraagt aan hun organisatiedoelen. Dat betekent dat je de werking van de IT-organisatie, IT-processen en IT-aansturing bij klanten analyseert. Op basis daarvan geef je advies over de besturing die past bij de doelen en kenmerken van de organisatie, inclusief de benodigde rollen voor optimale IT-ondersteuning tijdens hun digitale transformatie.

In deze rol verbind je de business en IT, en breng je de uitdagingen van beide goed naar voren. Je kunt optreden als analist, specialist, proces- of informatiemanager. Het is een afwisselende functie, waarbij je voor meerdere opdrachtgevers verschillende rollen vervult. Door je brede inzetbaarheid werk je samen met diverse specialisten van de klant en collega's van Highberg.

**Voorbeelden van projecten die jij uitvoert als Consultant informatiemanagement**

De rode draad is dat je het leuk vindt om opdrachtgevers te helpen bij een optimale inrichting en besturing van de informatievoorziening. Voorbeelden van projecten die je uitvoert:

* Je voert een analyse uit op de volwassenheid van de regieprocessen van IT en doet voorstellen voor verbetering op zowel processen, rollen als besturing. In 3 maanden vorm je samen met een collega een zo goed mogelijk beeld van de organisatie van IT aan de hand van onze methodiek en leveren jullie een analyse, inclusief voorgestelde roadmap voor verbetering, op aan de klant.
* Je helpt een overheidsorganisatie met het optimaliseren van de organisatie om te voldoen aan het IV-stelsel Rijk. Je inventariseert de stakeholders, interviewt diverse belangrijke spelers, leest je in over de historie en doet voorstellen voor uitgangspunten en uiteindelijke invulling.
* Je stelt een informatiestrategie en informatieplannen op voor een uitvoeringsorganisatie waarin aandacht is voor de uitdaging van vandaag de dag zoals inzet van AI, compliancy aan (Europese) wetgeving en duurzaamheidsafwegingen. Je faciliteert inspiratiesessies met business en IT, werkt samen met gebruikers, informatiearchitecten en specialisten op diverse aandachtsgebieden.
* Je coacht informatiemanagers in hun rol en adviseert hen in de uitdagingen waar zij voor staan. Je kijkt mee waar zij tegen aan lopen in de praktijk en bent een sparringspartner die ook zo nu en dan de handen uit de mouwen steekt om te helpen.

**Wat is onze visie op Informatiemanagement?**

Informatievoorziening vormt het hart van veel organisaties. IT-toepassingen moeten altijd beschikbaar zijn en data moet betrouwbare management- en verantwoordingsinformatie opleveren voor strategische beslissingen. Toenemende eisen vanuit wet- en regelgeving en ethische overwegingen spelen een cruciale rol in de vormgeving van informatievoorziening.

Onze klanten staan midden in de maatschappij en gebruiken IT-toepassingen vaak voor samenwerking met partners, waardoor deze toepassingen waardevol moeten zijn voor klanten en burgers. Onze adviezen hebben daardoor vaak direct maatschappelijke impact. Organisaties moeten waarde toevoegen en verantwoord handelen. Een effectieve informatievoorziening is hierin een essentiële schakel.

Wij begrijpen deze waarde en verbinden verschillende disciplines, waarbij we informatievoorziening benaderen met de vragen: 'Wat kan, wat mag en wat is wenselijk?'. Zo dragen wij bij aan een informatievoorziening die bijdraagt aan het succes van maatschappelijke organisaties.

**Wat vragen wij?**

* Een afgeronde HBO- of WO-opleiding op het gebied van informatie-, organisatie- of bedrijfskunde;
* Minimaal 4 jaar ervaring in de IT, informatiemanagement, regie. Of brede ervaring in (IT-)consultancy;
* Kennis over en ervaring met informatiemanagement, regie-organisaties, en gerelateerde werkwijzen zoals IT-servicemanagement voor besturing en beheersing van IT;
* Uitstekende beheersing van de Nederlandse taal in woord en geschrift;
* Een commerciële instelling, analytisch sterk en een proactieve aanpak in relatiebeheer, netwerken en offertetrajecten.

**Wie ben jij?**

* Je hebt een breedbeeld van nieuwe ontwikkelingen op gebied van wetgeving, veiligheid en ethiek, inzet van data en A.I., duurzaamheid en hun betekenis voor de klant;
* Je bent communicatief vaardig en een organisatiesensitief persoon die op verschillende niveaus weet te communiceren en adviseren;
* Iemand die een probleem snel kan doorgronden en dat zo eenvoudig mogelijk kan verwoorden;
* Iemand die het leuk vindt om bij te dragen aan uitdagende, maatschappelijk relevante opdrachten en vraagstukken.

**Wat bieden wij?**

* Een marktconform salaris en uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden waaronder prestatiebeloning, voorzieningen voor mobiliteit, pensioen en verlof;
* Oprechte aandacht voor persoonlijke ontwikkeling waaronder coaching door collega’s, toegang toe en breed opleidings- en trainingsaanbod en een persoonlijk ontwikkelplan met bijpassende investeringen;
* Een plek binnen een uitdagende en groeiende organisatie waar het nemen van eigen verantwoordelijkheid wordt gewaardeerd, je de autonomie en vrijheid hebt om je werk flexibel uit te voeren met korte communicatielijnen met collega’s;
* Een prettige werkomgeving met een prettig en goed bereikbaar kantoor, focus op prestaties als team en niet op het individu en tal van sociale activiteiten zoals borrels, sportactiviteiten en teamsamenkomsten.

**Over het team**

Job description


NExTWORKx\* is the strategic partnership between the Telecom and ICT service provider KPN and Delft University of Technology. NExTWORKx aims to develop new concepts & technology in telecommunication and artificial intelligence, to respond to new disruptive technologies and to continue the development of talent. NExTWORKx enters its second research phase with a focus on developing and applying concepts from network science to model the huge number of real-time interactions between software components and data sets and to enable monitoring and control. AI-based algorithms will be developed for monitoring information flows and smart contracts. A trusted layer for monitoring and control is crucial for every network and digital infrastructure individually, but also across critical infrastructures, data sharing and smart city platforms. NExTWORKx announces the hiring of 4 PhD students who will be mentored by both TUDelft and KPN staff. The 4 PhD projects contribute to the above goals, but each with a different focus:



* Safe use of AI in telecommunication networks


* Resilient cross domain networks for critical infrastructure


* Secure data sharing in federated edge clouds


* Co-evolution of telecommunication networks and urban systems



**Co-evolution of telecommunication networks and urban systems****:** Many cities are implementing smart city projects, using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and IoT analytics platforms to collect data on their infrastructure, processes and operations. This data is used to better manage resources, assets and services and improve operations (e.g. utilities, mobility). To support the digitization of cities the telecommunications networks also need to evolve in order to provide ubiquitous connectivity (5G/6G, fiber, LPWAN etc.), decentralised datacenter capabilities to optimize urban performance at the lowest possible cost and environmental impact (including energy consumption) and new network capabilities such as very precise location and timing services.



The key objective of this project is to discover how urban (digital) systems and telecommunications networks co-evolve. This is essential to 1) understand how the development of telecommunications network is driven by and at the same time facilitate the formation of our urban system, 2) identify telecom network development/planning that may further enhance the global telecom and urban performance from the perspective of economy, society and sustainability.



This PhD position will be based at the Multimedia Computing Group in the Department of Intelligent Systems (INSY).


* KPN and Delft University of Technology will work together on new ICT technologies (overons.kpn)

Faculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science


The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position. In total, more than 1000 employees and 4,000 students work and study in this innovative environment.

Job description


Moral problems are often thought of as dilemmas, with two options. However, in real-life there is often a potentially infinite number of choices that a moral agent can make in response to a problem.



Coming up with these potential responses, and reflecting on what they might mean and how they might play out in the world, requires creativity. This project investigates the role of creativity (including artistic creativity) in moral decision making, especially in connection with the innovation of technologies. The envisaged outcomes of this project include a theory of the role of creativity in the responsible development and anticipation of new technologies, and the establishment of methodological tools for transdisciplinary collaborations including artists, philosophers and technology developers. The PhD project will investigate these questions by combining philosophical reasoning with participation in transdisciplinary collaborations involving artists who work at the intersection of art, technology and society. To make this possible, we have established a collaboration with Waag Futurelab, which has experience with the exercise of moral creativity in artistic practice surrounding technologies.



This PhD position will be part of the Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies programme, ESDiT, a ten year long international research programme of seven academic institutions in the Netherlands that has started in January 2020. This programme has a combined budget of €27 million, and is funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research in the Gravitation funding scheme for excellent research, and by matching funds from the participating institutions. The duration is from January 2020 to December 2029. The programme has the aim of achieving breakthrough research in at the intersection of ethics, philosophy, technology / engineering and social sciences, and to position its consortium at the top of its field internationally. A key objective is to investigate how new technologies challenge moral values and ontological concepts (like “nature”, “human being” and “community”), and how these challenges necessitate a revision of these concepts. The programme includes four research lines, “Nature, life and human intervention”, “The future of a free and fair society”, “The human condition” and “Foundation and Synthesis: Ethics of Technology, Practical Philosophy, and Modern Technology-Driven Societies”.



This PhD project will be embedded in the Art Track that cuts across the whole programme. Depending on the interests of the PhD candidate, the project can berelated to one or more of the programme's main research lines. More information can be found on the ESDiT website: https://www.esdit.nl/ The candidate is expected to play an active role in the project described above and to participate actively in the workshops, public events, courses and other activities of the ESDiT programme in general and the Art Track in particular. ESDiT-PhD students are encouraged to spend a semester abroad, and a budget is available to cover expenses. Furthermore, generous (conference) travel budgets are available for the position.



The supervisory team for this position will consist of dr. Mandi Astola (TU Delft), dr. Julia Hermann (University of Twente) and Prof.dr. Sabine Roeser (TU Delft). The position is based at the Ethics and Philosophy of Technology Section at the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management (TPM) at TU Delft, which provides a stimulating and internationally oriented research environment.

***Would you like to pursue a PhD on intercultural ethics of existential risk? Then apply for a fully funded position at TU Delft's Philosophy Section.***


Job description


Philosophers are increasingly concerned with the impact of socially disruptive technologies on our existing concepts as well as new ones. One such concept that has recently emerged as a response to changing socio-technical circumstances is that of existential risks. Most discussions in the field don't pay attention to intercultural philosophical perspectives. For instance, the concept of existential risk finds its roots in a specific brand of Western-centric normative thinking, thereby influencing how we frame and approach what we find valuable and important for the purposes of preventing existential risks from materializing. The primary goal of the project is to study existential risks as part of broader conceptual cluster disrupted by socio-technological developments through the lens of general intercultural philosophy or a specific non-Western ethical framework. The resulting approach of ‘intercultural ethics of existential risks’ would be operationalized to explore whether and how insights and perspectives from under-represented philosophical traditions bear upon understanding existential risks (and related concepts), and subsequently, normative and practical questions associated with why their mitigation matters, for whom, and so on.



This PhD position will be part of the Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies programme, ESDiT, a ten year long international research programme of seven academic institutions in the Netherlands that has started in January 2020.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for:

**PhD candidate in Network Science (4 years)**


**About this position**  

Leiden University’s computer science department (LIACS), part of the Faculty of Science, is seeking an enthusiastic and well-qualified PhD candidate in network science, a field also referred to as complex networks or social network analysis. The position is for 4 years and is fully funded.  

The position is part of SSHOC-NL, a five-year national consortium project on advancing methods and infrastructure in, among others, the social sciences. Within SSHOC-NL Leiden University and University of Amsterdam jointly lead the work on large-scale social network analysis, which is the focus of this PhD position. While the position offers a certain degree of freedom in terms of the precise research direction, as part of the broader consortium project, the candidate will be asked to work on community detection in large-scale dynamic networks, and how this is affected by aggregation of the network. This ties into a broader objective of the consortium in which the aim is to understand how privacy-sensitive population-scale (network) data, possibly at an aggregated level, can be made accessible and interoperable.


The candidate will be part of the Platform for Large-scale Analysis of Networks Netherlands (PLANET-NL) interdisciplinary group of researchers in both computer science and social science, which will meet regularly as part of the broader consortium project. One particular object of study of this group, and thus possibly also for the candidate, is the multi-layer population-scale social network data of the Netherlands, featuring twelve years of longitudinal network data on all seventeen million inhabitants of the Netherlands and their family, work, school, neighbor and household ties (see, e.g., https://www.popnet.io).


The candidate will be encouraged to collaborate on projects with other members of the Computational Network Science (CNS, https://cns.liacs.nl) group. Moreover, there are ample opportunities to collaborate with other research groups at LIACS in for example data science, machine learning, text mining and algorithm design. It is furthermore possible to get engaged in (limited) BSc and MSc student (co-)supervision, as well as minor scientific organizational activities. Additionally, there are plenty of opportunities for interaction and collaboration, for example at the Faculty of Science through the Leiden Complex Networks Network (LCN2, https://lcn2.leidenuniv.nl) and nationally through the Dutch Network Science Society (https://www.netsci.nl).


To apply, candidates are required to submit, in addition to an academic CV, a brief motivation letter of at most 2 pages, including a short description of a research idea that the candidate would want to work on in light of this particular position.

**Key responsibilities**

* Conducting research in the area of network science, leading to peer-reviewed publications.
* Writing an article-based PhD thesis within the duration of the position.
* Participating in a broader national computational social science consortium project.
* Limited involvement in co-supervising BSc and MSc students and engaging in minor local organizational activities.
* Assist in relevant teaching activities.

**Required qualifications**

* A MSc\* in computer science or a related field (e.g., mathematics, physics or computational social science), ideally with experience (e.g., through a MSc thesis) on a networks-related topic.
* Experience with programming in Python and/or C++ and/or R, preferably with some large-scale network analysis experience.
* Willingness and ability to work in an interdisciplinary setting working across computer science and social sciences.
* Excellent proficiency of the English language.
* Able to work independently and in a team.
* An academic, creative and curious mindset.
* : excellent candidates not (yet) (fully) past the MSc phase, but sufficiently close to graduation, are also invited to apply.

Gezamenlijk zetten ons ruim 1.500 professionals zich dagelijks in voor ruim 65.000 werkgevers en ruim 1,5 miljoen werkenden om gezond, gemotiveerd en competent aan het werk te zijn en blijven. En dat levert een schat aan data op waar wij ons als afdeling Research & Development graag in vastbijten en deze vertalen in vernieuwende inzichten en datagedreven innovaties met inzet van AI.**



**Hoe ga je meer betekenen als Data Scientist**
-----------------------------------------------


Als Data Scientist bij HumanTotalCare denk je iedere dag vanuit jouw kennis en kunde mee over manieren waarop onze organisatie en professionals met behulp van data effectiever kunnen werken, en hoe we meer kunnen betekenen voor werknemers en werkgevers. Nu en straks.


Samen met je R&D collega’s en andere professionals uit de hele organisatie ontwikkel je concepten en ideeën die, via een innovatieproces met experimenten en pilots, tot schaalbare oplossingen voor de collega’s en klanten leiden. Dit doe je niet alleen en van achter je bureau, maar samen met je directe collega’s en in dialoog met de business.


Wij zijn er om in de praktijk belangrijk te zijn, en zetten hiervoor data en technologie samen met onze domeinkennis in. Denk aan het ontwikkelen van modellen voor beslisondersteuning in het verzuimproces, waarmee we het verschil maken door de juiste interventie op het juiste moment te initiëren. Of aan een datagedreven preventieproces waardoor een diagnose of prognose sneller gesteld kan worden en preventieve acties gerichter kunnen worden geadviseerd. Maar ook aan inzet van AI op de werkplek waarmee we onze professionals kunnen ondersteunen met efficiënte werkprocessen. We willen onze toegevoegde waarde meetbaar maken en monitoren onze KPI’s. Zo blijven we samen leren om onze processen en diensten te verbeteren.  



**Met wie ga je meer betekenen**
--------------------------------


Je wordt onderdeel van het veelzijdige R&D team, bestaande uit ongeveer 15 vaste collega’s. Met een mooie mix van consultants, research & business development, data scientists, project support medewerkers en machine learning engineers, aangevuld met een flexibele schil van onderzoeksassistenten, studenten en scientist practitioners ga jij impact maken.


Met een grote diversiteit aan kennis en kunde brengen wij data, wetenschap, technologie en praktijk bij elkaar. Dit doen we in nauwe samenwerking met collega’s van Business Intelligence, staf en IT. De organisatie weet ons goed te vinden en we hebben toegang tot een breed scala aan expertise van onze arbo-professionals. Van bedrijfsartsen tot arbeids- en organisatiedeskundigen en van ergonomen tot psychologen.



### **Wat is écht leuk aan deze baan**

* We hebben een schatkist vol relevante data. Van procesdata, verzuimdata, vragenlijsten tot vrije tekst of gebruik van onze platformen. Over onze dienstverlening heen, zowel inhoudelijke data rondom gezondheid van werknemers als procesinformatie en KPI’s (bijv. klanttevredenheid, omzet). Er is nog genoeg te ontginnen en veel ruimte voor jouw ideeën. Uiteraard binnen de kaders van de wet, privacy staat hoog bij ons in het vaandel.
* Jouw werk maakt echt verschil voor werkend Nederland. Wat je bedenkt kan ook echt in productie worden gebracht. Daarbij is er veel draagvlak binnen de organisatie voor wat je doet.
* Je wordt onderdeel van een hecht team, en elke dinsdag neem je deel aan de R&D dag met updates, demo’s of innovatiesessies.
* Je bepaalt voor een groot deel zelf waar je jouw energie in steekt en de meeste toegevoegde waarde ziet. Je krijgt veel autonomie om je werk in te richten zoals jij dat wilt. Zo vormt de functie zich naar jouw expertise en ambitie.

### **Is er ook iets minder leuk**


Het vakgebied is volop in ontwikkeling. Soms willen we te snel of moeten we eerst de data nog ontsluiten. Het is niet altijd een gespreid bedje en je bent nog aan het bouwen van jouw positie als Data Scientist binnen de organisatie. Maar met een flinke dosis doorzettingskracht en een goed verhaal kom je echt al een heel eind.



**Wat neem je mee**
-------------------


Nieuwsgierigheid en een beetje vakidiotie. Jij bent op de hoogte van de laatste inhoudelijke en technologische ontwikkelingen. En komt er weer wat interessants voorbij, dan maak jij je dit snel eigen. Je experimenteert met de mogelijke toepassing(en) hiervan. Je snapt de interactie tussen hardware en software en bedenkt graag dingen die echt een bijdrage leveren aan de praktijk. Daarbij heb je affiniteit met ons vakgebied van o.a. werk, gezondheid en gedragsverandering. En je weet hoe je jouw boodschap over de bühne moet krijgen. Complexe materie kun je uitleggen in de taal van je gesprekspartner, waar deze zich ook in de organisatie bevindt.


Verder vragen we het volgende:

* Een relevante universitaire opleiding (data/computer science of statistiek en methoden).
* Bij voorkeur minimaal 5 jaren relevante werkervaring als Data analist of Data Scientist en je hebt eerder gewerkt met grote hoeveelheden data, inclusief data cleaning.
* Je bent goed thuis in statistiek en onderzoeksmethoden.
* Je kunt uitstekend uit de voeten met Python, en liefst ook met een andere programmeertaal zoals R of Java.
* Je hebt ervaring met machine learning en bij voorkeur ook met andere data-analyse technieken, zoals simulatie, deep learning, en Natural Language Processing.
* Het is een pré als je ervaring hebt met infrastructuur en softwarearchitectuur die nodig zijn om modellen in softwareproductie te kunnen integreren (bijv. Docker, Kubernetes, microservices en REST API’s).
* De werkzaamheden en de documentatie zijn grotendeels in het Engels. Omdat je data vertaalt naar de business in onze organisatie, is het van belang dat je voldoende Nederlands spreekt en schrijft (B2).

**Wat krijg je ervoor terug**
-----------------------------


Als HumanTotalCare zetten we ons in voor een gezond, gemotiveerd en competent werkend Nederland. Vanuit onze merken adviseren en ondersteunen we werkgevers en werkenden gedurende hun hele werkzame leven. Zo zijn we van betekenis voor werkenden, organisaties en onze maatschappij. En wat we naar buiten beloven, doen we ook intern. We bieden je dan ook:

* **Een open, informele werksfeer.** We doen het voor, door en met elkaar.
* De mogelijkheid om **hybride te werken**, waarbij we er graag voor zorgen dat jouw thuiswerkplek ergonomisch helemaal op orde is. Er is veel aandacht en ruimte voor een **gezonde work-life balance**.

* Direct een **vast contract**.
* Alle aandacht voor preventie en vitaliteit. We zijn trots op ons vitaliteits- en ontwikkelprogramma.
* **Gezellige evenementen en borrels**, zowel met de afdeling als met de hele organisatie, omdat we informele contacten met collega’s ook heel belangrijk vinden.

**Your job**
------------


In this NWO-funded project, you will investigate the regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in establishing the average acyl chain length of membrane lipids in yeast.


Proper function of membranes and membrane proteins critically depends on the regulation of the fluidity (viscosity) of the membrane’s lipid matrix. In response to e.g. a change of the ambient temperature, the model eukaryote *S. cerevisiae* adjusts the fluidity of its membranes by tuning the level of unsaturation and the average length of the membrane lipid acyl chains. Whereas the mechanism of the former has been solved, the regulation of acyl chain length remains a mystery, although this more subtle mechanism may be equally important for membrane function. Your project will address this challenging fundamental question at the interface of yeast genetics, cell biology, and membrane biochemistry and biophysics.


You will investigate the regulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in establishing the average acyl chain length of membrane lipids in yeast. In fatty acid synthesis, Acc1 synthesises malonyl-CoA that is iteratively consumed by FAS in producing C16 or C18 fatty acyl-CoA. Based on data obtained by us and others, we hypothesise that the C16/C18 ratio of the acyl-CoA produced is determined by the relative activities of these 2 key enzymes, i.e. increased activity of Acc1 *vs*. FAS favors a rise in C18 over C16 and *vice versa*.


You will investigate how yeast regulates Acc1 *vs.* FAS activity by designing and engineering a set of mutants, and applying a range of biochemical, genetic, -omics, and (fluorescence) microscopy approaches to uncover the underlying mechanisms.


Your tasks and responsibilities will include:


* conducting independent research in the regulation of yeast membrane lipid composition, resulting in academic publications in peer-reviewed international journals;
* supervising Bachelor's and Master's thesis projects with topics relevant to your project;


**Your qualities**
------------------


We are looking for an ambitious and creative molecular life scientist who is interested in working at the interface of biochemistry, genetics and biophysics. You enjoy being part of an interdisciplinary team of scientists, and meet multiple of the following criteria:


* You have a PhD in molecular biology, genetics, biotechnology or related discipline.
* You have demonstrated experience with (yeast) molecular biology and genetics.
* You have a strong interest in (yeast) membrane and cell biology.
* You are strongly motivated, flexible, and able to run multiple projects simultaneously.
* You have a professional command of English, both in writing and speaking.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* A position for one year, which will be extended to three and a half years after positive evaluation.
* a working week of 38 hours and a gross monthly salary between €2,770 and €3,539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth.

Visit us on LinkedIn and discover how you can become part of our community.


Research in the Membrane Biochemistry and Biophysics group focusses on the molecular mechanisms of cellular processes that involve biological membranes. We aim to unravel mechanisms underlying membrane assembly, homeostasis and function, with special emphasis on the lipid-protein interactions involved. Our research will help improve fundamental understanding of membrane function and provide insights in membrane-related diseases (such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease). In flanking applied research we investigate the modes of action of e.g. membrane-active drugs. Within MBB the team of Toon de Kroon studies membrane lipid homeostasis in the reference eukaryote *S. cerevisiae*. MBB participates in the Bijvoet Centre for Biomolecular Research and in the Institute of Biomembranes.

**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


De digitalisering van de maatschappij heeft grote maatschappelijke effecten en biedt kansen voor het aanpakken van maatschappelijke vraagstukken. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is één van de technologieën die in hoog tempo wordt ontwikkeld en toegepast. Voor de politie biedt AI kansen om haar taak effectief uit te blijven voeren en om efficiënter te werken. De politie heeft AI dan ook aangemerkt als een van de sleuteltechnologieën die van belang is voor innovatie en de ontwikkeling van de organisatie.


Als junior data scientist bij Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen (TWO) ga je de politieoperatie ondersteunen met behulp van AI. Dit doe je (onder andere) door wetenschappelijk onderzoek, dat wordt gedaan door promovendi bij het AI-lab, toe te passen op de politieoperatie. Daarnaast toon je initiatief om aan projecten, die vanuit de operatie komen, mee te werken en hierin de juiste data science of AI-oplossing toe te passen. Je gaat werken met verschillende soorten data zoals beeld en tekst. Hierin ben je op zoek naar nieuwe mogelijkheden en technieken om zo goed mogelijke resultaten te bereiken.


Het data wetenschappelijk werk is nog volop in ontwikkeling bij de politie. Daarom is het mogelijk dat er ook aanpalende werkzaamheden moeten worden verricht zoals data preparatie of business analyse.


**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


Het Nationaal Politielab AI (NPAI) bestaat uit verschillende onderdelen. Een deel wat zich focust op wetenschappelijk onderzoek waar promovendi werkzaam zijn en het Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen (TWO).


Wetenschappelijk onderzoek is de samenwerking van de politie met verschillende universiteiten (Universiteit Utrecht, de Universiteit van Amsterdam, en de TU Delft). Het doel van dit deel van het Politielab AI, is om samen met de wetenschap kennis op te bouwen en verantwoorde toepassingen te realiseren voor de politie met state-of-the-art AI. Hiertoe werken meerdere master studenten, promovendi (oftewel PhD-kandidaten), onderzoekers, postdocs en senior wetenschappers (waaronder hoogleraren) samen. Het wetenschappelijk onderzoek binnen het Politielab AI heeft een centrale rol in de ontwikkeling van AI binnen de politie. Op dit moment werken negentien promovendi in de wetenschappelijke tak van het Politielab.


Jij gaat werken bij Team Wetenschappelijke Ontwikkelingen. De primaire taak is de overdracht faciliteren van onderzoeken van promovendi naar inzet binnen de politie. Er werken momenteel elf medewerkers bij TWO.


Het TWO heeft een aantal taken:


* het vertalen van onderzoeksresultaten naar de operatie. Hiermee vormt TWO de brug tussen het wetenschappelijk onderzoek en de inzet binnen de politie.
* het opbouwen (op basis van de onderzoeksagenda) van kennis en het maken van “verantwoorde” toepassingen (concepten) waar anderen middels experimenten op doorontwikkelen zoals de Dienst ICT en het programma Digitalisering.
* het, waar nodig, begeleiden van experimenten en proeftuinen die onder leiding van het programma Digitalisering plaatsvinden.


**Wie ben jij?**
----------------


Als junior data scientist combineer jij je kennis van data en verschillende technieken met je enthousiasme om dit toe te passen binnen de politie. Je bent leergierig en vindt het belangrijk om bij te blijven in je vakgebied. Ook ben je proactief en waar je kansen ziet spreek je dit uit. Je weet dit te vertalen naar mogelijke nieuwe projecten om je collega’s te ondersteunen. Daarnaast vind je het belangrijk om in verbinding te staan met zowel de operationele collega’s als met mede data scientists. Met beide collega’s kun je goed communiceren en samenwerken. Hierdoor krijg je een goed beeld van de zaken die spelen en voor welke problemen bestaande oplossingen kunnen worden toegepast.


Daarnaast beschik je over:


* hbo werk- en denkniveau\* bij voorkeur in een technische specialisatie zoals Artifical Intelligence, Data Science, Business Analytics, Computer Science of vergelijkbaar;
* kennis met het toepassen van verschillende data science en AI toepassingen;

***Challenge: understand how river deltas adjust to change.***


***Change: improve our ability to predict timescales of sedimentary processes.***


***Impact: better evaluate the consequences of our interventions on delta evolution.***


Job description


Many of the world’s hotspots for nature and biodiversity, but also for human population, economy and agriculture are situated on river deltas. Deltas form by the transport, deposition and erosion of sediment at the interface of rivers and open water. The dynamics of these sedimentary systems depend on a range of factors including sea level, waves and tides, and the supply of water and sediment by rivers. Ongoing climate change and engineered interventions such as dam construction and river engineering have rapidly changed the conditions in which deltas have formed. This should lead to deltas changing their morphology, but it may take deltas decades to thousands of years to adjust to new conditions. We currently cannot fully predict the pathways in which deltas do this, and thus the consequences of anthropogenic interventions on future delta evolution.



In this PhD you will explore how delta morphology adapts to quickly changing conditions. You will use numerical models (such as Delft3D) to model deltas and quantify changes in the sediment transport network (e.g. using SedTRAILS). With the models, you will analyse morphological changes and the timescales over which these changes take place. Depending on your interests and expertise, you may link models to selected case studies through remote sensing or field data. Your work will improve our understanding of past, current and future episodes of delta evolution, and our ability to anticipate for changes in terms of mitigating adverse effects and possibilities of building with nature.



You will join the Applied Geology section in the Department of Geoscience and Engineering of TU Delft’s faculty of Civil Engineering and Geoscience. In the Applied Geology section you will find a collaborative team studying sedimentology, Earth’s surface processes and subsurface characteristics. Within the faculty you will be part of a vibrant and growing community of scientists and engineers studying rivers, deltas and coasts, and their sedimentary deposits. You will be encouraged to learn new skills, develop your own ideas, and explore new collaborations. You will share your findings at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. These experiences will pave the way for diverse career paths in industry, consultancy, governmental agencies, or universities.


Requirements


To be considered for the position you will have:


* A Master’s degree in Earth Science, physical geography, civil engineering, geology, physics, modelling, or a closely related field. If your education and experience are from a less-related field, please clearly explain your motivation for pivoting to this topic.
* Experience with sedimentary systems, sediment transport, sedimentology, geomorphology, morphodynamic processes, river engineering or coastal engineering, e.g. in thesis or project work.
* Experience with a high-level programming language, e.g. Python or Matlab.
* A keen interest in quantifying morphodynamic processes.
* Excellent oral and written communication skills in English.


It would be a strong plus for you to have:


* Experience with using numerical models (e.g. Delft3D).
* Experience with analysing sedimentary systems through remote sensing, fieldwork, physical experiments, or other methods.


Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.

Are you interested in how synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function help wire the developing brain? Do you want to use cutting-edge optical techniques for live cell imaging, including 2-photon microscopy? Would you enjoy working in an international environment where you follow up on your ideas with the support of experts around you? Then this job may be for you.  


**What you will be doing?**
The developing mouse visual cortex is wiring up during the week before eye opening and neurons establish most of their synapses during that time. Synaptic transmission is very energy demanding and developing neurons need to provide sufficient energy to fuel transmission at emerging synapses. In this Health-Holland funded project, we will measure the energy balance of developing synapses, how synaptic plasticity affects the energy balance of neurons and whether energy metabolism at developing synapses may be compromised in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders.
You will be able to take advantage of the latest microscopy approaches, such as 2-photon microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging, to investigate how developing synapses satisfy their energy demands. Since these processes underly proper wiring of the brain, it is not surprising that errors in energy metabolism are associated with developmental disorders and therefore your project may not only help better understand brain wiring, but also shed light on the underlying causes of developmental cognitive disorders.  


**Who are we looking for?**
You are a highly motivated, self-driven candidate with a Master’s degree in neuroscience, (neuro)psychology, biomedical sciences or natural sciences. The ideal candidate will have experience with neurophysiological and/or live cell imaging techniques and a solid background in neuroscience. Programming skills - in particular with Python for data analysis - will be very useful for your project. You are a team player and comfortable communicating, presenting and writing in English.  


**What do we offer?**
We offer ample opportunities for further development of knowledge and technical and personal skills through courses at the Academy and (inter)national conferences and:
* Good terms of employment (see further)
* Mentoring, supervision and training
* Access to state-of-the art equipment
* A stimulating international research environment

* A Curriculum Vitae
* An application letter, stating how your education, goals and interests align with this position
* Two reference letters

One important difference between human milk and infant formula is the fat droplet interface composition and structure, which can greatly impact digestibility. To make digestion more comparable, a better understanding of the relationship between interface composition and functionality is needed, which can be used to improve the structure of infant formula. One option to stabilize the fat droplet interface is using milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), which has been introduced as a promising natural ingredient. However, the composition of MFGM ingredients can greatly vary depending on isolation methods. The extent of this variability and its effect on MFGM functionality remains unknown.  

  

The main aim of this project is, therefore, to understand the impact of processing-induced variations in MFGM composition on their functionalities, particularly in terms of physicochemical stability and digestibility of the emulsions. You will work in close connection with a second PhD candidate in the Food Chemistry group, who uses these insights to develop plant-based alternatives.  

  

**What will you do?**  

As a PhD candidate, you will contribute to:* production and characterisation of MFGM extracts;
* characterization of their emulsification properties;
* digestibility of these emulsions;
* performing comparisons on the systems with MFGM and plant-based alternatives.

**Your duties and responsibilities include:*** taking charge of the PhD project and performing the proposed research;
* developing and executing analysis on state-of-the-art chemical analytical equipment;
* publishing your results in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presenting them at (inter)national scientific conferences and/or symposia;
* supervising and guiding BSc and MSc students during their thesis;
* collaborating with the other team members and partners from the larger consortium;
* fulfilling the requirements of the PhD program, including completing a training and supervision plan to develop your personal skills as a researcher further.

**You will work here**  

The research is embedded within the chair of Food Quality and Design, and you will become a member of a dynamic and international group that also includes a team of dairy scientists. During your PhD, you will use state-of-the-art analytics, such as e.g., liquid (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), static or semi-dynamic digestion models (based on INFOGEST protocol). You will be part of the Dairy Chemistry and Physics team, which is led by dr. Etske Bijl. During your PhD, your will also be co-supervised by dr. Marie Hennebelle who is leading the Lipid Chemistry team. Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:* partially paid parental leave;
* working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;

Challenge: Transforming the conventional carbon-intensive energy use



Change: AI to turn data into knowledge for efficient systems



Impact: Boosting the sustainable, fair and reliable energy transition


Job description


TU Delft is a top tier university and is exceedingly active in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a strong expertise in energy systems. Energy systems are the backbone of our modern society, but are becoming increasingly complex and challenging to operate as renewable energy, heating and transport sectors are integrated into the system. It’s crucially important that energy systems are sustainable, reliable and effective, now and in the future.



As part of your 4-year PhD project, you will develop novel graph-based machine learning algorithms for state estimation of energy systems. The scientific challenge is to design a real-time state estimator for an active distribution system considering future needs. The future system requires tasks to manage flexibility provisions from distribution systems, effective anomaly detection, congestion management, and fraud detection. State estimation is an important task where the operator considers very little noisy measurement data to infer the full system state. However, often, the accuracy is used to infer the full state while the true state is seldom known and can only be reproduced in computer simulations. Therefore, you will explore a novel approach investigating graph neural networks and structural information and learn the state-estimator weakly-supervised enforcing known constraints. Your PhD research will be in the area of applied data-driven scientific computing combining statistics, time-frequency analysis, low-dimensional model reductions, and other techniques to extract information from data. With implicit or explicit methods, you will apply weakly-supervised learning making the information useful for the management and planning of complex energy systems, for example with graph neural networks.



You will be hired as a PhD researcher at TU Delft. Your academic supervisors are Dr. Jochen Cremer and Prof. Peter Palensky. Recognising the transformational power of AI, TU Delft joins forces in the Innovation Center for AI (ICAI) with the distribution system operator Alliander and with other Dutch Universities. As a member of the Intelligent Electrical Power Grids research group at TU Delft, you will be affiliated researcher with the ICAI AI for Energy Grids Lab and with Delft AI Energy Lab where we combine ground-breaking AI methods with the reliable theory of the physical energy system. Practically, you will spend one day a week at Alliander (in Arnhem) where you will be supported by around 10 scientific staff, data scientists and power system experts.



About the department at TU Delft:



The research in the Department of Electrical Sustainable Energy is inspired by the technical, scientific, and societal challenges originating from the transition towards a more sustainable society and focuses on four areas:


* DC Systems, Energy Conversion and Storage (DCE&S)
* Photovoltaic Materials and Devices (PVMD)
* Intelligent Electrical Power Grids (IEPG)
* High Voltage Technologies (HVT)


The Electrical Sustainable Energy Department provides expertise in each of these areas throughout the entire energy system chain. The department owns a large ESP laboratory assembling High Voltage testing, DC Grids testing environment, and a large RTDS that is actively used for real-time simulation of future electrical power systems, AC and DC protection, and wide-area monitoring and protection.



The Intelligent Electrical Power Grid (IEPG) group, headed by Professor Peter Palensky, works on the future of our power system. The goal is to generate, transmit and use electrical energy in a highly reliable, efficient, stable, clean, affordable, and safe way. IEPG integrates new power technologies and smart controls, which interact with other systems and allow for more distributed and variable generation.


Requirements


* An MSc degree in either Machine Learning, Robotics, Control Systems, Operations Research or in Power/Energy Systems, Electrical Engineering, etc.

There is ample evidence showing that the human population is on an unsustainable trajectory, with increasing CO2 emissions and declining biodiversity. While knowledge on the climate system is growing, our ways to teach students and engage with the public regarding this information is keeping up with this pace. In this position, you will combine teaching and research on the interface between the sciences and the arts.


**Your job**
------------


Moving towards a sustainability transformation requires our students to adapt to change and to develop their capacity to shape and create change. For this, it is important to connect the cognitive learning objectives (head) with practical skill development (hand) and affective learning objectives (heart). In this PhD project, the aim is to implement the head-hand-heart approach in our climate change research and education. You will therefore be working on the interface between the sciences and the arts. On the one hand, you will work on environmental topics, including data gathering in the field or living labs, and data harvesting from large data repositories, data analysis and modelling. On the other hand, you will work together with the University of the Arts Utrecht (HKU), working, for instance, on gamification and sonification of climate science.


To explore and study the interface between the climate sciences and the arts, the Copernicus Institute of sustainable development is looking for a combined teacher-PhD candidate with an interest in education and sustainability & climate science. In this position, you will combine research on environmental sciences and sustainability education with teaching in our bachelor and master programmes. As a combined teacher-PhD candidate, you have a six-year contract to complete your PhD research and obtain a University Teaching Qualification (UTQ/BKO) in combination with teaching and education development.


Teaching is primarily based at the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, in the Bachelor Global Sustainability Science and the Master Sustainable Development. Your time between research and teaching is divided 60-40. In addition, approximately 10% of your time is allocated for professional and academic development, for instance for obtaining a University Teaching Qualification (UTQ/BKO) and following PhD courses. You will also join the Geosciences Graduate School for PhDs.


**Your qualities**
------------------


We are looking for a candidate with a background in natural sciences and a proven passion for sustainability education. You are somebody that likes to prepare your students for the great challenges of the coming decades with your teaching and research. As an ideal candidate you have:


* a Master’s degree (or you graduate before starting date) in Environmental Sciences, Sustainability Sciences, Earth Sciences, Biology, or a related field;
* proven ability to work with large datasets and model-output;
* affinity with the societal context of sustainability challenges;
* interest in and a positive experience with teaching (e.g. teaching assistant, junior teacher, high school teacher);
* motivation to further develop your teaching skills and acquire the University Teaching Qualification (UTQ/BKO);
* energy to combine teaching and research over a 6-year period;
* excellent communication and academic writing skills in English (equivalent to B2).


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for one year, with an extension to a total of six years upon successful assessment;
* a working week of 36 hours and a gross monthly salary between €3,226 and €5,090 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale 10 under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth.

Schuberg Philis continues to expand its focus on data for a growing number of customers which means that we are looking for Data Engineers.



We keep our customers moving forward by designing, building and running their data landscapes.

You get to actively explore, design, build and run data lakes in AWS. Your work will be completely customer-focused but you will also contribute to expanding and maturing the Schuberg Philis data landscape architecture and all of its initiatives.


**Who are we looking for?**



In this role, you will thrive if you have the following experience:


* Building data pipelines in a cloud-native manner (e.g. S3, Lambda's, Glue, etc )
* Used to working with large data sets in both data lakes (S3) & data warehouses (Redshift)
* Good AWS knowledge, especially all the data related services

* Spark + Spark Streaming (Java/Scala or PySpark)


Nice to have:


* Software development, particularly API's (Python)
* Kafka & Kafka Connect
* Terraform
* Docker
* Proficiency in Dutch
* AWS Data Analytics Certifications

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)
* Python en SQL

**Fijne pre's:**

* Kennis van jaarrekeningcontrole
* Kennis van Microsoft Fabric
* Kennis van Pyspark

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.

  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.

Maar dat is zeker niet het enige. De Rabobank is een coöperatieve bank met een missie. Samen met klanten, leden en partners zet de Rabobank zich in voor een sterkere leefomgeving en voor de grote maatschappelijke uitdagingen van nu, met als uitgangspunt dat er samen meer bereikt wordt dan alleen. Die missie kan alleen waargemaakt worden doordat Rabobank een krachtige bank is die efficiënt werkt.


Daarnaast is Rabobank actief betrokken bij veel maatschappelijke initiatieven. Een deel van de winst wordt geïnvesteerd in de samenleving. Verder weg, door te zorgen dat boeren een eerlijke prijs krijgen voor hun producten. En dichtbij, door in heel Nederland samen buurten beter te maken. Zo’n 1250 organisaties in sport en cultuur die voor veel mensen een tweede thuis zijn worden ondersteund. Een ander voorbeeld is het project met Humanitas, waarin mensen worden geholpen die financiële problemen hebben hun thuisadministratie op orde te krijgen. Een derde voorbeeld is dat samen met Vluchtelingenwerk Nederland 1.500 vluchtelingen worden geholpen bij het vinden van een goed passende baan.


Om haar kerntaak blijvend te realiseren heeft Rabobank een ambitieus plan opgesteld waarin het creëren van een optimale Engineering Journey een belangrijke pijler is.

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.
* Masters degree, PhD or equivalent experience in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, etc.).
* We prefer candidates with Deep Learning experience, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. Experience with TensorFlow is a plus.
* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).
* Excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal; the ability to convey your message to team members and other collaborators.

**Background information**

Within the Machine Control group, we are responsible for orchestrating and synchronizing all high-level behavioral actions. We have a large number of modules working in parallel in a large configuration space. Due to the large scale and complexity of the system, there is a need for an abstracted overview of the system.

  

We need such an overview for multiple reasons. It can be used to improve the overall understanding of the system, and it can be used by experts to quickly diagnose unexpected behavior, considerably reducing investigation time.

  

Currently, the process of creating such an overview is mostly manual and labor-intensive task sometimes assisted by rudimentary tooling. The existing tooling does not support diagnostics enough due to low user-friendliness and missing features.

**Assignment description**

The aim of your project is to take the existing tooling as a starting point, polish and extend it such that it can better facilitate diagnostics of the system behavior. In this assignment you will:

* Gather the needs of the experts;
* Ensure the system stores the data required to generate the overview;
* Streamline the tooling to improve the diagnostic workflow of the user;
* Closely interact with users to iteratively create a polished product.

**Your Profile**
----------------


To be a perfect fit for this assignment, you:

* Have background in Computer Science or related;
* Are a bachelor student looking to do your thesis (bachelor graduation project/thesis), or a master student looking to gain work experience (master apprentice);
* Are able to translate functional requirements and design in to software designs;
* Are experienced in Python (required), and experienced in C and/or C++ is a bonus.
* Have knowledge in diagnostic methods (preferred);


Other requirements you need to meet:

* You are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship;
* You need to be located in the Netherlands to be perform your internship. In case you ‘re currently living/studying outside of the Netherlands, please include in your CV/motivation letter willingness to relocate.

 Apply Now
***This position seeks a junior scientific programmer to further develop and integrate existing movici and multi-model.nl platforms and support the development of new (multi-)models of infrastructure interactions. The work will be done in close cooperation with PhDs, postdoc, senior experts on modeling theory and decision-making and practitioners from infrastructure providers. This position can potentially be turned into a PhD postion.***


Job description


Infrastructures provide the basis for many critical societal processes, from economy to education, from healthcare to housing and more. The infrastructures are increasingly interdependent on each other, from providing mutual services (like energy and data for mobility), via to providing alternative capacity (like rail, road and waterways), to competing for the same space (like in urban contexts).



Models and simulations are key tools for decision makers, allowing them to build, design, and plan infrastructures. As the need for integrated, cross system insight rises, current monodisciplinary and mono-sectoral models are increasingly unable to provide the required insights. A promising direction is multi-modelling, where different models and simulations are combined in an ecosystem of tools, that can be used and re-used in different configurations. The model ecosystem, and the socio-technical approach to modelling poses new methodological and technical challenges.



Models are instrumental for supporting the social process of decision-making, and are not a goal in themselves. Key model and software requirements will stem from the users and the social process that they are involved in. You, as a developer will be involved in these processes where needed, but are not expected to organize and manage them.



Work will consist of two main lines, platform development and model development support. Platform development involves integration of existing open-source platforms MOVICI and multi-model.nl, identifying new requirements and features from the users and developing them. Model development includes software implementation and general computing and data analysis support for researchers, modelers and modelling and simulation theorists. You may also be asked for advice on the most suitable software solutions, data structures, architectures, code redesign where necessary.



Goal of the position is the further development of the MOVICI and multi-model.nl platform towards a tailored tool for broad impact analysis in a complex stakeholder environment. The later means a lot of attention for describing and modeling scenario’s, a wide range and flexible approach towards evaluative criteria for these scenario’s, clear visualizations in space and time on scenario development, and interconnection with other modeling platforms.



We are looking for a person who enjoys (re)design and implementation ""done right"", with long term maintainability, reusability and generalizability being important, without losing sight of practicality. Willingness to work closely with domain experts and modeling theorists is paramount. Correct and clean representation and implementation of the relevant concepts is much more important than churning out features quickly. You will be working in research focused academic setting, so affinity with science, scientific methods and processes is useful.


Requirements


The software stack is organised around open source workflows: git, python, docker, Apache Airflow, linux shell and some C++. We also make use of REST interfaces and client-server architectures where relevant. Prior experience with these technologies is desirable but is explicitly not expected. We do expect solid python programming ability, high level of general computing skills and eagerness to learn more, as well as a good command of the English language. Dutch proficiency is desired but not necessary.



This is a junior position, and your interests, willingness to learn and team fit are much more important than prior experience with specific technologies.



We are seeking a recent graduate from a computer science/ computer engineering / programming and/or data science-oriented MSc program, but candidates with different background are also encouraged to apply. The position could in term be changed to a modeling and simulation focused PhD position.



We expect that you will take the initiative, be independent and can handle a high degree of freedom, especially in the technical domain. However, you will not be left alone to “figure it all out by yourself”. You will be part of a team that takes personal development and growth, mental health and neurodiversity seriously. You will be working closely with Dr. Ir. I Nikolic, and Prof. Dr. W. Veeneman.


Conditions of employment


* A salary based on scale 9 of the CAO for Dutch Universities with a minimum of €3.377,- and a maximum of €4.640,- gross per month based on a fulltime contract (38 hours), plus 8% holiday allowance and an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%.
* An excellent pension scheme via the ABP.
* The possibility to compile an individual employment package every year.
* Discount with health insurers.
* Flexible working week.
* Every year, 232 leave hours (at 38 hours). You can also sell or buy additional leave hours via the individual choice budget.
* Plenty of opportunities for education, training and courses.
* Partially paid parental leave
* Attention for working healthy and energetically with the vitality program.

Then apply for our internship within the Logistics BI team of PostNL and support our complete international business!  

  

**Uitdagingen**  


At PostNL, our business unit “Cross Border Solutions” (CBS) makes it easy for people and businesses to communicate and trade across international boundaries. CBS aims to become the most respected service provider by supporting the cross-border e-commerce market through creative and innovative distribution solutions. In this international business unit we have 13 offices worldwide with 1.200 employees, being agile, customer focused and reliable. CBS serves customers over 190 countries. Within CBS, the department called “Business Intelligence & Analytics” (BI&A) provides insights for the entire CBS organization. We aim for the whole of CBS to have the knowledge and tools to be capable to make data driven (fact based) decisions.

  

  

During your Logistics BI internship, you will work together with BI&A and other IT and business colleagues from CBS to automate one of our most labor-intensive processes managed in MS Excel to a master data application. In this project you will analyse the current process, conduct stakeholder interviews and create a proposal to maximize the efficiency. As a next step, you ensure the successful implementation of the accepted proposal by implementing new cross-team ways of working, integrations and conducting trainings where applicable. You are not in it alone! You will get guidance from a team member and have many opportunities to fine-tune your ideas and action plan with colleagues.

  

  

Besides this core project, you will also be invited to participate in the team’s agile rituals and other activities, contribute to the maintenance of existing and building of new reports and can also get your hands dirty in our ongoing dashboard migration and data modelling projects. We also have a number of initiatives running to improve the way we handle unplanned work; have better overview and reporting capabilities about our data and service quality; implement new standards and tools for our engineering framework and experiment with generative AI solutions to make our work smarter. You are, of course, as a Logistics BI intern, invited to play a role in this important transformation journey, and share your own ideas and views!

  

**Je verantwoordelijkheden**  

**Visible work:** You help our (internal) customers with new information and insights, so that they can run the operations and planning efficiently, and make decisions based on the best quality data. Your improvements will allow us to understand performance of our international business even better!  

**Challenge:** You dive into a complex data management process that supports our reporting capabilities. This allows you to really experience what it means to provide insights to the Netherlands' favorite delivery service!  

**Good atmosphere:** You work together with motivated colleagues from 22 nationalities who dare to seize opportunities and help each other move forward.  

**Freedom:** You will work from home and in a flexible workplace in our vibrant, modern office in the historic Stationspostgebouw (next to Holland Spoor station).  

**Development opportunities:** You will be given plenty of opportunities to follow training courses and grow into other positions or departments. Besides working on a central project, you will also have the chance to contribute to various other activities in our end-to-end team of data analysts and engineers, and leave your mark with improvement ideas on all areas of our daily work.  

  

**Wat breng jij mee?**  


With your analytical skills and curiosity, you know how to convert complex data into useful insights. You also have a keen eye and fresh perspective for continuously improving our way of working. With your 'can do' mentality, you connect the different teams in the data flow from source to dashboard to speed up the generation of insights for all the important business decisions we make every day, based on reliable data. You are able to independently tackle various human and organizational issues, from data collection to managing of expectations.  



**In addition, you bring the following with you:**


* You are currently following a relevant university education, such as a Master in IT, Business Administration, Data Science or Statistics;
* Strong working knowledge of MS Office, especially Excel;
* Knowledge of programming languages (e.g. SQL) and data visualization tools (e.g. Power BI) is a big plus;

The Faculty of Science and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) are looking for:

**PhD candidate | Environmental impact assessment of pollution at the ecosystem level (0.8-1.0 fte)**

**Vacancy number: (14994)**


**Background**


The freshwater system and its adjacent ecosystems host countless species because of their need of water. These are the earths’ natural capital and drivers of many ecosystem services we humans depend on. At the same time, the presence and effects of anthropogenic stress in the aquatic environment are multitude and ubiquitous. These include the omnipresence of chemical pollution such as the use of agricultural chemicals.


To relatively quickly assess the impacts of chemicals a standard risk assessment framework is in place. While valuable, the frameworks often lacks ecological realism. Researchers from Leiden University therefore experiment in outdoor freshwater experimental systems with natural food webs such as the “Levend Lab” (EN: “Living Lab”, https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/livinglab) to identify how biodiversity responds to the impacts of pesticides, fertilizers, invasive species and nanomaterials.


Using ecological theory, a large array of different experimental and statistical analytical methods are currently in practice to perform and analyze such experiments. The key challenge for the PhD candidate is to test these different forms of experimental and statistical analytical methods to identify stressor - ecosystem function relationships. The research will likely entail measuring different forms of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functionality followed by statistical modelling to infer causality of stressor impacts and their propagation through the ecosystem.


We invite prospective candidates to unravel the intricate network of species interactions between each other and their environment. The candidate will use new analytical methods and develops models and interpretation scenarios to identify how pollution impacts species and their role in ecosystem functionality.

**Key tasks:**

* *Perform* mesocosm pollution experiments in the ‘Levend Lab’ facility of Leiden University
* *Further develop* and test different types of statistical analyses at the community to ecosystem level
* *Advance* ecological theory by identifying the anthropological and natural drivers of species and their roles in ecosystems

**Selection criteria:**

* You should have an M.Sc. in a relevant field (environmental science, biology, ecology and/or ecotoxicology), but we also consider candidates from other related scientific fields.
* Experience with experimental field and laboratory skills and (aquatic) organism identifications are highly valued
* Strong background and interest in statistical analyses, data management, visualization and coding skills (in R, but Python also applies) is highly valued.
* You must be proficient in spoken and written English.
* You are a team player and have a collaborative attitude.


**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,800 staff and almost 6,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 150 FTE (including postdocs and PhD candidates) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

We offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 4 years based on performance. Salary ranges from € 2.770 gross per month in the first year to € 3.539 gross per month in the fourth year based on a full-time position (pay scale P in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities).


Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development and sabbatical leave. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break.


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website. Female researchers are also welcomed to join the Researchers In Science for Equality network of the Faculty if Science (rise.nu).

 **Hoe ziet jouw toekomstige werkdag eruit?**  

Je start de werkdag goed met een lekkere kop koffie. Samen met je collega’s praat je bij over het weekend. Maar niet te lang, want aan het begin van de ochtend heb je meteen de weekstart van de GGD. Samen met je communicatiecollega’s bespreek je welke gezondheidsonderwerpen je de komende periode uitlicht. Dit doe je aan de hand van de omgevingsscan waarop je aanhaakt bij de behoefte van de inwoners, de contentplanning en ons jaarplan.


Hierna ga je gelijk aan de slag met het maken van content. De nieuwe social mediacampagne moet namelijk vandaag worden ingepland. Jij weet als geen ander hoe je met creatieve content de doelgroep kan bereiken. Naast je eigen kennis en ervaring, gebruik je hierbij de data en resultaten van eerdere, gelijksoortige campagnes.

Als je terugkomt start een online meeting met een projectleider over een nieuwe voorlichtingscampagne. Je stelt vragen over doel, doelgroep en adviseert vervolgens over middelen.


Na de meeting neem je de tijd om je mail bij te werken. Je ontving een vraag van een journalist. Samen met de inhoudsdeskundige die de woordvoering doet, formuleer je de antwoorden op de vragen. Later deze week begeleid je het persmoment. Het laatste uur voer je een maandelijkse analyse uit om het gebruikersgedrag op de websites in beeld te brengen.

We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**  

Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA.

Werken aan de mobiliteit van morgen  
Van de politie die informatie opvraagt over een kenteken tot een journalist die onderzoeksvragen heeft over kentekens en rijbewijzen in Nederland: als unitmanager zorg jij dat alle externe partijen op tijd de juiste informatie krijgen. Je geeft leiding aan collega’s en zet hen in hun kracht, ontwikkelt strategische plannen en realiseert afspraken en doelen volgens het managementcontract.

Bovendien werk je samen met onze relatiemanagers om effectief contact te houden met externe partners, zoals brancheorganisaties en medeoverheden.

Daarnaast ben je teamlid van het managementteam van de afdeling, met wie je het beleid ontwikkelt en afstemt. We zijn volop bezig met de doorontwikkeling van onze afdeling. Jij helpt ons de volgende stap te zetten: je kijkt hoe we onze dienstverlening beter kunnen structureren en professionaliseren, bijvoorbeeld met de inzet van data-intelligence. Je houdt externe ontwikkelingen in de gaten, vertaalt deze naar onze afdeling en je unit en zet kansen voor innovatie om in projecten. Daarvoor werk je nauw samen met ICT-serviceteams om te zorgen dat de oplossingen onze doelen ondersteunen. Ook ben je opdrachtgever van stuurgroepen bij multidisciplinaire projecten.

Dit is jouw thuisbasis  
Jouw unit Informatieverstrekking bestaat uit zo'n 32 collega’s en je geeft direct leiding aan de teammanagers, unitadviseurs en onder andere de medewerkers die zich bezighouden met privacy en security. We vormen een hechte club: we zijn betrokken, staan altijd voor elkaar klaar en hebben oog voor wie jij bent, als collega én als mens. Ook organiseren we leuke teamuitjes om onze band te versterken. Door je centrale rol in onze organisatie ben je vaak op kantoor te vinden, maar thuiswerken kan ook: jij voelt goed aan wanneer dat kan!

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van het AD in Rotterdam. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data.

Naast redactie-analisten zijn er diverse centrale rollen in het team die jou bij je werk zullen ondersteunen.  

  

**Functieprofiel**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.


**VOORWAARDEN**


* salaris, passend bij jouw ervaring;
* 38-urige werkweek, minder uur in overleg;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;
* ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden d.m.v. opleidingen en trainingen;
* We geloven in een gezonde werk-privébalans waarbij je voldoende ruimte krijgt voor jouw welzijn en flexibel werken.

Jouw werk is van grote invloed op de rechtspraak. En daarmee op het leven van mensen. Want de rechtspraak kan niet zonder goede informatie.

Jij speelt een centrale rol in die informatievoorziening. Een opdracht op niveau, waarbij de prioriteiten die jij stelt of laat stellen het verschil maken!

De portefeuille Bedrijfsvoering levert generieke diensten aan Rechtspraak collega's en externe partijen, zoals burgers, rechtzoekenden, journalisten en ketenpartners.

Samen met je collega-informatiemanagers breng jij in kaart welke informatie nodig is om rechtszaken en bedrijfsondersteunende processen optimaal te laten verlopen. Daar maak je voor jouw thema beleid op, ook voor de lange termijn. En je ziet toe op de uitvoering van dat beleid. Zo bouw je mee aan de digitale toekomst van de rechtspraak in ons land.


Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware twee talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.

Job Squad was founded by a couple of young Danish entrepreneurs with a passion for recruitment and HR. One has years of experience in corporate recruitment, the other is a startup obsessed with more than 4 of these young businesses to his name. Both of these young mavericks came together with their shared experiences to create Job Squad, a personal recruitment agency with a corporate twist. Job Squad’s vision was to create career opportunities for Europeans across borders, that will strengthen and develop their personality and career diversity. By breaking down borders and bringing on a wide variety of clients and positions we try to make sure there’s a position and dream destination for everyone.


At Job Squad we like to think of ourselves as professionals without the formality - after all, we are here to help and make sure both job hunt and relocation are as seamless and supportive as possible. Furthermore, we are a big multinational team, living and working in many different countries, but working closely both in and between teams! An internship at Job Squad means that you will become an essential part of the team, and you will have tasks and responsibilities and we expect you to be proactive.

Van werkstress tot machineveiligheid en van hybride werken tot gevaarlijke stoffen. Arbo is het platform dat arboprofessionals ondersteunt in hun dagelijks werk. Door ze te informeren over ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken. Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.  

  

**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.



Als hoofdredacteur Arbo ben je onderdeel van de centrale redactie van het ‘professionals portfolio’ van VMN media, waar ook PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb onderdeel van zijn. Samen zijn we een team van 14 personen.

 **Wat krijg je:**


* **Fijn team** – Leuke, betrokken collega’s die samen mooie content voor de doelgroep maken. Binnen het Arbo-team, maar ook in nauwe samenwerking binnen het professionals portfolio.
* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.



Verder nog handig om te weten: het gaat om een functie van 36 uur per week. Het kantoor van VMN media staat in Zeist.


**Je bent overtuigd**
