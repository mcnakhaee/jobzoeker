You’re doing this by advocating for SRE and DevOps best practices.



You will be teaming up with Adriaan, DevOps Tech Lead; Matthijs and Cole, DevOps Engineers; and Jan, our Engineering Manager.



To be successful in this role, you should be excited to join a company that is working towards a cleaner energy future. You should thrive in a collaborative, entrepreneurial environment and be motivated to keep learning new things. You should care deeply about writing great software, following the latest best practices in terms of implementation details, documentation, and automated testing.


#### **This role is watt you've been looking for!**



What’s in it for you?


* You’ll be part of setting up the fundamentals for future growth. Together with your team, **you’re setting the baseline** for years and years of development to come
* **A healthy environment**, where we put trust in our fellow Dexterians. With this trust comes flexibility to do your job how you see fit and in our setting, there’s plenty of room for your ideas and wishes
* Our salary and stock options are pretty good
* We offer a personal **Learning & Development** budget and every last Friday of the month we have a Learning & Development Day
* Every Monday and Thursday, our chef prepares a nice (warm) lunch at the office
* You will be surrounded by extremely smart people

 **To be successful in this role, you'll need:**


* Strong experience with GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Gitlab
* A solid understanding of CI/CD, IaC, SRE and DevOps
* Proficiency in Python or experience working in a Python-based environment are a big plus
* To be opinionated and passionate about technology, scalability, reliability, security and availability
* An urge to automate, document, communicate and collaborate
* A passion for renewable energy and a desire to make a difference in the world

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!



One very important note….don't hold back! Even if you think you don't meet 100% of the criteria listed in this job role, we still encourage you to apply. We believe that everyone should have equal access to opportunities and want to ensure we provide an inclusive experience, so do let us know if there is anything else we can do to support your application process.

Join us on our journey as Splunk Solution Engineer, and enjoy a culture of inclusiveness, disruption, and fun while selling smart and winning big.
What’s the role of a Solution Engineer at Splunk?* You will technically own, discover, position, prove and deliver the key technical elements of a sales cycle to achieve a ‘technical win’ within large scale and complex customer environments. You’ll use a range of communication styles, a range of technology skills and experiences and a range of soft skills and people skills to develop trust relationships with both your sales colleagues and your customers.
* You will be an advocate and ambassador for Splunk through your professional social media, industry and marketing events and supporting pipeline generation activities
* You will collaborate with your customer contacts, and build them into Splunk champions, by helping them to understand how Splunk can help them to solve some of their most challenging problems and help them achieve their objectives.

* Business Savvy: You understand how businesses are organized, how they achieve their desired results, what challenges they are likely to face, what solutions they need and what transformations they could make with your solutions.
* A growth mindset: You build in time to develop your skills, knowledge, experience or capabilities. You look beyond the current opportunity towards the wider set of opportunities that could exist in a prospect.
* A Collaborator: You understand that selling is a team game, so you spend time developing your network of colleagues and partners to achieve your success – and theirs.
* Competitive: If you’re in it, you want to win it!
* Fun: Getting the job done and enjoying & generating fun don’t need to be mutually exclusive.
* The candidate must be based in the Netherlands and be fluent in Dutch and English.


Helpful technical skills or experience (not all required, but consider how Splunk could benefit from your background)* Domain knowledge and experience in any of the following areas: IT infrastructure, Cloud Technologies, Application Delivery, Business Analytics or Log Management

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!

GCA’s strategy in Africa is implemented under the flagship Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP), launched by GCA and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to scale up adaptation efforts and mobilize finance for climate-resilient development in Africa. To date, GCA has integrated adaptation solutions into $9 billion worth of investments funded by IFIs across Africa. GCA’s work under the AAAP focuses on four pillars where investments in adaptation and resilience building can yield high economic dividends for African nations, including: Food security; Infrastructure and Nature-based Solutions; Youth entrepreneurship and adaptation jobs; and Adaptation finance.  



  

The R4I team conducts research to support GCA’s programmatic work and develops academic and training programs on adaptation to empower scholars and professionals as well as serving as an adaptation incubator to globalize the exchange of adaptation knowledge which would have otherwise remained geographically constrained.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development

We combine traditional methods with promising novel technologies such as metagenomics, artificial intelligence, data science and advanced data analysis. We develop exciting new multidisciplinary lines of research and we will train scientists, students and experts to become world-leading in this new frontier of research.


Biodiversity loss is recognized as one of the most significant threats to our sustainable future which calls for serious action. Naturalis can play an important role in this transformation and will, among other things:

* Foster excellence in science and innovation in the field of biology and earth sciences;
* Provide a vibrant scientific environment for early- and mid-career researchers;

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Then this is a great opportunity to join our team and help us to further****develop our forest research and forest resources models like EFISCEN-Space!**  

  

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research and modelling of European forest resources.  

  

An important element of our work is the development and application of European forest simulation models like EFISCEN-Space Such models aim to understand and visualize the role that European forests play for biodiversity, climate, soil, renewable resources and the environment, and how Climate-Smart Forest management can contribute to optimize this role. With these models, we help managers and various authorities (local, regional, national and EU) to evaluate and further shape European forest and climate policies.  

  

You will be responsible for the implementation and management support of current projects including the communication with EU project partners. This will be done in consultation with the project leader, and you will replace the project leader when needed in project related matters. You will actively engage in acquisition of new projects and develop yourself into an independent project leader. Together with the team you will further develop and refine various functionalities of the simulation models (e.g. forest management, harvest costs & revenues, biodiversity, soil carbon) and apply them in the projects.  

Besides this, you will also orientate yourself on developments in related (forest) ecological and forest management or monitoring disciplines. In the team and within projects, you contribute to model development, research, improving and interpreting research results together with other (senior) researchers and project leaders. You will also contribute to the acquisition of externally funded scientific research on Dutch and European forests in the context of (climate) policy and management studies. Depending on your level of experience also supervision of more junior researchers will be part of your work.  

  

Examples of projects we work in are: TRANSFORMIT, WILDCARD, MoniFun, SUPERB and Holisoils. Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:* working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;
* the option to accrue additional compensation hours by working more;
* sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
* there is a strong focus on vitality and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
* a fixed December bonus of 8,3%;
* excellent pension scheme.

We offer, depending on your experience, a competitive gross salary of between €3088 and € 6522 for a full-time working week of 36 hours, in accordance with the CLA Wageningen Research (scale 10-12). Additionally, a contract for 32 hours can be discussed. You will initially receive a one-year contract, which under unchanged market conditions can be extended upon in mutual enthusiasm.

 Apply Now
Join ReBioClim, a Project Aiming to Pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in Four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.
* Ability to work independently and in a result-oriented way.
* Availability to start in January 2025.


Nice-to-haves:


* Experience in conducting geospatial analysis in a programming environment such as R or Python.
* Knowledge of co-design workshop methodologies.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

Join ReBioClim, a project aiming to pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.
* Ability to work independently and in a result-oriented way.
* Availability to start in January 2025.


Nice-to-haves:


* Experience in conducting geospatial analysis in a programming environment such as R or Python.
* Knowledge of co-design workshop methodologies.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

**Background**


Within ING we make use of data science for a variety of use cases (such as improving financial health of our customers by transaction forecasting). The data science models which run in production all generate output this data needs to be delivered to different destination within ING. These destinations vary from data lakes and kafka topics to Cassandra datastores.


In the past a generic Interface format (GI) was developed as a one size fits all solution to standardize the output delivery for our data-scientists. Over time many models have adopted this interface but we are now facing challenges such as files which became too big or the throughput time is too long.

**The opportunity**


We would like to deep-dive into this topic by dedicating an intern as engineer to investigate our use cases and look for a future proof solution. This includes gathering information, do market research (buy vs built) and design / develop one or more prototypes together with our data-scientists data engineers.

**Team** **overview**


You, as an intern will join one of our data-engineering teams which support the ING data-scientists. The teams work on a variety of topics to maintain and evolve our data-analytics environment in Google Cloud.

* Located in our Amsterdam office.
* Mix of local and off-shore colleagues (so multiple nationalities)
* We work in agile teams based around Scrum and continuous delivery principles.
* Our teams work in hybrid mode, we work from home when possible and work from the office at least one day a week.
* We have 36 hour working weeks.

**Roles and responsibilities**


This assignment is about understanding and improving our way of distributing data-science model output. The current implementation of GI (Generic Interface) needs to be examined as well as our use cases and the industry standards available. The goal is to boost new alternatives and bring us further in achieving an excellent data-driven organization.

**Expected l****earnings**

You will be working in an environment with modern continuous delivery tools with people who have a continuous improvement mindset. Tools include Azure (CDaaS), Google GCP (Terraform, Vertex AI, BigQuery), NiFi for data flow management.


Working in a complex environment such as ING can be challenging and this is part of the learning and our people and teams are there to help you.


Communication and collaboration are key and this involves working closely together with domain experts such as data-engineers, data-scientists and machine learning engineers.

**Expected output**


An inventory of required features, an improved understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the current implementation and a redesign plus implementation plan (part of this can also contain a buy vs built decision or a vendor selection).


When time allows the output also consists of the implementation of a prototype solution.

**How to succeed**


You can succeed in this role by showing:

* a “can-do” mentality
* you are a “self starter” (pro-active)
* you speak out and like to challenge yourself and the people around you
* you have a background in IT, information management or similar
* experience and affinity with machine learning is very useful
* it helps if you like programming (python, java, scala) though this is not a show stopper

**Rewards and benefits**  

This is a great opportunity to train with highly skilled people who are experts in their field. You’ll do a lot and learn a lot –  

not only about your specialist area and the bank, but also about yourself and whether this type of environment is right for you.

  

You’ll also benefit from:

* Internship allowance of EUR 700/month for 36 hours (maximum)
* Compensation of travel costs
* Your own work laptop
* Hybrid working to blend home working for focus and office working for collaboration and co-creation

**Why?**

Every swipe, every like, every TikTok video we upload, every Zoom call we have, every Netflix video we watch, or everything we buy online is all processed and depends on… data centers. However, these data centers consume large amounts of energy due to the underlying technology we use every day all day.

**How?**

We have developed an AI-based analytics platform that captures the entire data center (DC) infrastructure—""from roof to room""—to bring the whole DC into a more optimal state. This platform saves energy, water, and scope 3 emissions while increasing reliability and sustainability in data centers across countries like Germany, France, the UK, Australia, and The Netherlands.

**Additionally you will**

* Be able to perform hands-on model development and deployment activities.
* Work closely with the AI research team to quickly identify new and potentially impactful developments in ML and AI.
* Support and enthuse our product managers in their quest to develop and deliver a market-changing solution that has its foundation rooted in a relentless focus on cutting-edge AI.
* Closely collaborate with our software engineers, MLOps engineers, and other stakeholders to ensure seamless integration of machine learning solutions into our products and services.

As such, this role represents a unique opportunity to have a broad impact on our organization and to contribute significantly to our technological evolution.

Job requirements

* Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science , Mathematics or a Physics related field with abundant ML experience.
* 5+ years of proven experience as a Data Scientist, preferably in a SaaS product domain.
* 1+ years experience in hiring and managing a team of data scientists.
* A preferred experience with ML/ AI that deals with physical processes and relations.
* Experience with cloud platforms and containerization technologies.
* Experience with one or more data science platforms like Dataiku, Databricks, DataRobot, etc.
* Strong programming skills in languages such as Python, Java, or Scala.
* Excellent problem-solving skills and ability to work in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.
* Strong communication skills and ability to effectively convey technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
* Strong pre: experience with on-prem ML model training, inference and deployment for production-grade solutions.

***This position seeks a junior scientific programmer to further develop and integrate existing movici and multi-model.nl platforms and support the development of new (multi-)models of infrastructure interactions. The work will be done in close cooperation with PhDs, postdoc, senior experts on modeling theory and decision-making and practitioners from infrastructure providers. This position can potentially be turned into a PhD postion.***


Job description


Infrastructures provide the basis for many critical societal processes, from economy to education, from healthcare to housing and more. The infrastructures are increasingly interdependent on each other, from providing mutual services (like energy and data for mobility), via to providing alternative capacity (like rail, road and waterways), to competing for the same space (like in urban contexts).



Models and simulations are key tools for decision makers, allowing them to build, design, and plan infrastructures. As the need for integrated, cross system insight rises, current monodisciplinary and mono-sectoral models are increasingly unable to provide the required insights. A promising direction is multi-modelling, where different models and simulations are combined in an ecosystem of tools, that can be used and re-used in different configurations. The model ecosystem, and the socio-technical approach to modelling poses new methodological and technical challenges.



Models are instrumental for supporting the social process of decision-making, and are not a goal in themselves. Key model and software requirements will stem from the users and the social process that they are involved in. You, as a developer will be involved in these processes where needed, but are not expected to organize and manage them.



Work will consist of two main lines, platform development and model development support. Platform development involves integration of existing open-source platforms MOVICI and multi-model.nl, identifying new requirements and features from the users and developing them. Model development includes software implementation and general computing and data analysis support for researchers, modelers and modelling and simulation theorists. You may also be asked for advice on the most suitable software solutions, data structures, architectures, code redesign where necessary.



Goal of the position is the further development of the MOVICI and multi-model.nl platform towards a tailored tool for broad impact analysis in a complex stakeholder environment. The later means a lot of attention for describing and modeling scenario’s, a wide range and flexible approach towards evaluative criteria for these scenario’s, clear visualizations in space and time on scenario development, and interconnection with other modeling platforms.



We are looking for a person who enjoys (re)design and implementation ""done right"", with long term maintainability, reusability and generalizability being important, without losing sight of practicality. Willingness to work closely with domain experts and modeling theorists is paramount. Correct and clean representation and implementation of the relevant concepts is much more important than churning out features quickly. You will be working in research focused academic setting, so affinity with science, scientific methods and processes is useful.


Requirements


The software stack is organised around open source workflows: git, python, docker, Apache Airflow, linux shell and some C++. We also make use of REST interfaces and client-server architectures where relevant. Prior experience with these technologies is desirable but is explicitly not expected. We do expect solid python programming ability, high level of general computing skills and eagerness to learn more, as well as a good command of the English language. Dutch proficiency is desired but not necessary.



This is a junior position, and your interests, willingness to learn and team fit are much more important than prior experience with specific technologies.



We are seeking a recent graduate from a computer science/ computer engineering / programming and/or data science-oriented MSc program, but candidates with different background are also encouraged to apply. The position could in term be changed to a modeling and simulation focused PhD position.



We expect that you will take the initiative, be independent and can handle a high degree of freedom, especially in the technical domain. However, you will not be left alone to “figure it all out by yourself”. You will be part of a team that takes personal development and growth, mental health and neurodiversity seriously. You will be working closely with Dr. Ir. I Nikolic, and Prof. Dr. W. Veeneman.


Conditions of employment


* A salary based on scale 9 of the CAO for Dutch Universities with a minimum of €3.377,- and a maximum of €4.640,- gross per month based on a fulltime contract (38 hours), plus 8% holiday allowance and an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%.
* An excellent pension scheme via the ABP.
* The possibility to compile an individual employment package every year.
* Discount with health insurers.
* Flexible working week.
* Every year, 232 leave hours (at 38 hours). You can also sell or buy additional leave hours via the individual choice budget.
* Plenty of opportunities for education, training and courses.
* Partially paid parental leave
* Attention for working healthy and energetically with the vitality program.

Then we have an opportunity for you.

  



**Job Description**  

In the plastic packaging value chain, there is only limited information available on the plastics in that chain to assess circularity and recyclability goals, especially the use of post-consumer recyclates (PCR) in packaging.

  


Quality specifications, monitoring, and standardisation of materials are common in certain industries like chemistry and pharma but are, at this point, only in an infancy state in plastic waste management. A major challenge when it comes to mechanical recycling of plastics is that the quality of the material is not monitored throughout the whole process. Inline monitoring is however essential for predicting the final quality of PCR.

  


In the MoQuP-R project, we focus on the necessary quality monitoring tools and the application of existing models related to the prediction of recyclate quality in order to increase the use of PCR in packaging. In this project your responsibilities will entail:


* Review literature to identify potential inline analytical methods to monitor quality parameters.
* Adapt laboratory and/or offline analytical techniques to be used inline in polymer processing equipment.
* Propose and execute design changes to polymer processing equipment to enable inline measurements.
* Design experiments using polymer processing equipment and post-consumer plastics to apply and develop monitoring tools.
* Evaluate the different methods in relation to PCR quality.
* Manage a work package in the MoQuP-R project.
* Present your work at international conferences, MoQuP-R consortium meetings, and other events and write scientific papers for international peer-reviewed journals.
* Provide teaching assistance and/or supervision of researchers and students.

  




As a Postdoctoral Researcher you will work in the Circular Plastics team in the Faculty of Science and Engineering located at Brightlands Chemelot Campus in Geleen. You will become part of a young international research group, specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics with a strong polymer science background. Your will work together with Rudinei Fiorio on this exciting topic.

  


**Requirements**  

We expect you to have the following experience, knowledge, and skills:


* A PhD degree in mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, process analysis, mechatronics, or similar;
* Advanced skills in CAD and interfacing sensor data to analysis software (e.g. Python, Matlab, Simulink);
* Good knowledge on analytical techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, GCMS;
* Skills in polymer processing;
* Experience with industry collaborations is considered advantageous;
* Proficiency in both written and spoken English.

Our alliance spans 70 countries and includes farmers and forest communities, companies, governments, civil society, and millions of individuals. Together we work to protect forests and biodiversity, take action on climate, and promote the rights and improve the livelihoods of rural people.

To protect nature and improve lives it’s becoming increasingly urgent that we approach the way we use our land and produce food and other products in more sustainable ways. For this to succeed we need to fundamentally change the way that businesses operate and source, and the choices we all make as consumers.

Our growing global alliance aims to transform our relationship with our natural resources and each other, to create a better future for people and nature together.

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.
* Masters degree, PhD or equivalent experience in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, etc.).
* We prefer candidates with Deep Learning experience, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. Experience with TensorFlow is a plus.
* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).
* Excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal; the ability to convey your message to team members and other collaborators.

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.
* Masters degree, PhD or equivalent experience in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, etc.).
* We prefer candidates with Deep Learning experience, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. Experience with TensorFlow is a plus.
* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).
* Excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal; the ability to convey your message to team members and other collaborators.

**Hoe ziet een werkdag van Iris als Senior Data Analist eruit?**  

Mijn werkdag als analist bij CBR begint altijd met een dagstart met de andere analisten. Hierin bespreken we de stand van zaken met betrekking tot de huidige sprint, of we ergens tegenaan lopen en proberen samen oplossingen te bedenken.  

  

Een werkdag als analist bij CBR is eigenlijk nooit hetzelfde. Een dag vult zich met het voeren van gesprekken met de business, het uitwerken van eerder ingediende dataverzoeken vanuit de business, ad hoc data-analyses en het helpen/meedenken met de andere business analisten.  

Het is daarbij belangrijk om de prioriteiten goed in te schatten en een planning te maken, zodat alles op tijd afkomt. Soms is het wel even schakelen tussen alle verschillende afdelingen en processen, maar dit maakt het werken bij CBR extra leuk en interessant.

Then this is the perfect job for you!
  
Knab was founded in 2012. We are an online bank, but one run by real people. We are known for being different because we want to do things differently. Simpler, smarter, and more affordable for our customers. By combining smart technology with a healthy dose of common sense, we create financial services that meet your needs. We add sublime, personal service to this, creating something unique in the financial sector.  

  

**Your role and responsibilities**  

Are you passionate about problem solving and combining the use of different tools in your daily work? And are you interested in the interest rate risk and enjoy improving processes? As a Senior ALM Specialist you will be responsible for managing and modelling interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) in a small and engaged team.  

  

Furthermore, the role will include at least the following:


* Managing the interest rate risk through hedging and designing optimal risk steering;
* Developing and refining interest rate related models (e.g. non-maturing deposits, cash flows, prepayments, mortgage pipeline, hedge accounting);
* Shaping decision-making, policies and analyses for senior management;
* Reporting the IRRBB and FX position to ALCO;
* Staying up-to-date with the latest changes in regulation (i.e. EBA, BCBS 239) related to IRRBB management;
* Enhancing reporting processes with regard to the automation and quality of the reported data;
* Assisting junior team members in their professional development.


The current interest rate environment and changes in EBA IRRBB regulation make it a very dynamic and exciting time to be part of a first-line of defence ALM team. The combination of the current economic climate, a flat-structured bank and a wide range of projects offer you a great opportunity to grow professionally and develop a holistic view on interest rate risk of the bank.  

  

**The team**  

The Asset and Liability Management & Methodology (ALM&M) team’s goal is to deliver on Knab’s strategy by optimizing the balance sheet of Knab. We do this by ensuring that the interest rate risk and funding positions of Knab are managed within the boundaries set in the strategies for those risks whilst not losing sight of the profitability of the bank.  

  

We believe in assigning ownership instead of tasks and, as a result, everyone within the ALM&M team gets the chance to own and be in the lead of a focus area within our team. This creates a flat structure which enables people to take initiative and develop their professional career on their own terms.  

  

On a personal side, we are a fun and multi-national team of curious and knowledgeable people. We perceive work as a challenge to improve ourselves and the bank. We like to work together and learn from each other through regular knowledge sharing sessions. We also enjoy spending time together outside of the work (e.g. having a drink or a game of padel.  

  

**Your profile**  

To be successful in this role, this is the kind of traits we have in mind:


* Completed masters degree in (Quantitative) Finance, Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics or similar;
* 5-7 years of relevant working experience in financial modelling, ALM or balance sheet management;
* Experience with Python, R, VBA (Excel) or C++ is a must, SQL is a plus;
* Experience with ALM / risk software solutions such as QRM or Ambit Focus is preferred;
* Ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and concise way;
* Self-starter with the ability, agility and motivation for self-learning;
* Excellent control of the English language, both written and verbally. Dutch is a bonus.


Did you know that according to research, women are less likely to apply than men when they don't meet all the job requirements? What a shame. Because, in our view, 'the perfect candidate' is a myth. So, if you have the drive to grow in aspects of this role, we look forward to your application.  

  

**This is Knab and this is what we offer you**  

Come as you are. Knab is an open workplace with positive vibes. We are inclusive of all nationalities, races and genders. We feel comfortable to bring our authentic whole selves to work and like you to do so too.  

  

If you come to work with us, Knab will become a significant part of your life. Therefore, we make sure the ambiance is just as exciting as your job. If you have any questions regarding this role or the process, please feel free to reach out to us.

Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief samen te werken in een team zijn van essentieel belang. Je bent proactief, leergierig en kunt goed omgaan met veranderingen en uitdagingen. Daarnaast heb je een sterke drive om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en ICT-management.

**Wat ga je doen?**

Deze functie is nieuw binnen Lab21, wat betekent dat je een grote invloed hebt op de invulling ervan. Je zult een onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren. Als Junior ICT Manager speel je een belangrijke rol bij het implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen binnen ons bedrijf. Je werkt nauw samen met verschillende teams om de behoeften van de organisatie in kaart te brengen en technologische oplossingen aan te dragen. Je analyseert en optimaliseert bestaande systemen en processen en identificeert kansen om AI-technologieën toe te passen.

**Plaats in de organisatie:**

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

– Peter van Dyck – teammanager Energie- opwek & warmtenetten

  

Voor een ambitieus afstudeerproject zijn wij op zoek naar een analytisch sterke hbo’er. De kern van deze opdracht is het ontwikkelen van een geavanceerde tool die gebruikmaakt van o.a. big data, machine learning digital twins en AI om bestaande/draaiende warmtepomp/WKO installaties te evalueren en optimaliseren. De tool zal de operationele prestaties van deze installaties vergelijken met de oorspronkelijke (theoretisch) bepaalde energetische rendementen en op basis van deze vergelijking verbeterpunten identificeren.

  

De ontwikkelde tool moet in staat zijn om complexe datasets te analyseren, patronen te herkennen en aanbevelingen te doen voor het bijsturen van de bedrijfsvoering. Hoewel de tool uiteindelijk gevalideerd zal worden met behulp van een casus, ligt de primaire focus op de ontwikkeling van de tool. Je gaat aan de slag met de volgende taken:

  

* Ontwerpen en ontwikkelen van een tool die grote hoeveelheden data kan verwerken en analyseren
* Toepassen van machine learning algoritmes en AI-technieken om inzichten te genereren
* Creëren van een gebruiksvriendelijke interface voor de interpretatie van de analyse-uitkomsten in Skysparks
* Ontwikkelen van een validatiemethodiek om de tool te testen met realistische data
* Samenwerken met experts om de tool af te stemmen op de behoeften van de utiliteitsbouw en de industrie
* Documenteren van het ontwikkelproces en de technische specificaties van de tool
* Presenteren van de ontwikkelde tool en de bevindingen aan belanghebbenden

  

Je maakt kennis met het bedrijf. Je neemt deel aan (team/kennis)overleggen en je kunt mee naar klantgesprekken. Uiteraard word je begeleid door een collega. Spreekt jou dit aan en ben jij op zoek naar een stage waar je kennis en ervaring kan opdoen voor een periode van minimaal 20 weken? Reageer dan nu en wij maken graag kennis met je!

### **Dit is wat jij meebrengt**

  

* Hbo studerend richting Werktuigbouwkunde, Elektrotechniek of vergelijkbaar;
* Ervaring met programmeren in talen zoals Python, R of MATLAB;
* Kennis van machine learning, data-analyse en AI-principes;
* Vermogen om complexe technische concepten te vertalen naar praktische oplossingen;
* Sterke analytische vaardigheden en een systematische aanpak van problemen;
* Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en de mogelijkheid om zowel zelfstandig als in teamverband te werken.

Deze onderhoudsopgave biedt de kans om onze infrastructuur te verduurzamen en klaar te maken voor de toekomst, inclusief klimaatverandering. Deze taak vereist inzet van dienstonderdeel Water Verkeer en Leefomgeving (WVL). WVL brengt specifieke kennis in op het gebied van grondwater, klimaat, duurzaamheid, milieu, veiligheid en scheepvaart, en verbreedt deze door middel van dataverzameling en modellen. Wil jij hier een bijdrage aan leveren als adviseur grondwater? Lees dan snel verder.



Hoe jij bijdraagt in jouw rol



Grondwater is cruciaal voor de ondergrond waarop Rijkswaterstaat zijn netwerken bouwt en onderhoudt. Het is onlosmakelijk verbonden met ons werk en het borgen van grondwaterrisico’s is essentieel. Bij aanleg, beheer en onderhoud van het hoofdwegennet, hoofdvaarwegennet en hoofdwatersysteem kunnen ingrepen grondwatereffecten veroorzaken die invloed hebben op de omgeving.



Als versterking van de WVL-organisatie breng jij jouw technisch-inhoudelijke expertise op het gebied van grondwater in. Je past jouw kennis toe binnen het bredere kader van assetmanagement en sluit aan bij nieuwe werkwijzen vanuit de vernieuwingsopgave, zoals de productiestraten van de Werf (onze landelijke projectorganisatie van PPO/GPO/CIV) en het werken met leeropgaven.



Jij adviseert over onderzoeken voor diverse projecten binnen Rijkswaterstaat. Je formuleert specificaties en toetst de werkzaamheden van opdrachtnemers. Daarnaast werk je aan kennisontwikkeling via standaarden, innovaties en modellen, in samenwerking met collega’s, marktpartijen en kennisinstellingen zoals Deltares.



Het uitvoeren van berekeningen met grondwatermodellen behoort tot jouw kerntaken, evenals het beheer en onderhoud van deze modellen. Bovendien adviseer en borg je grondwatermeetnetten, waarmee je een cruciale rol speelt in het veilig en effectief beheren van onze infrastructuur.



Dit is waar jij voldoening uit haalt



Jij haalt er voldoening uit om beleid en kennis naar de praktijk te vertalen en vice versa. Je adviseert graag over onderzoeken voor aanlegprojecten en beheer- en onderhoudswerkzaamheden, en haalt energie uit het toepassen van jouw inhoudelijke kennis.



Je voelt je thuis in een team waar gedrevenheid en inhoudelijke kennis centraal staan. Tegelijkertijd is er vanuit de Vernieuwingsopgave een grote behoefte aan het vertalen van doelen en strategieën naar concrete projecten. Dit doe je in nauwe samenwerking met andere afdelingen binnen Water, Verkeer en Leefomgeving, de uitvoeringsdiensten GPO en PPO, en de Rijkswaterstaat regio’s waar vernieuwingsprojecten plaatsvinden. Hierdoor bouw je een breed netwerk op binnen Rijkswaterstaat.



Binnen je team heb je veel contacten met de regio’s en projecten van Rijkswaterstaat. Het verbinden van zowel mensen als inhoud is jouw tweede natuur.



Wat wij aan jou waarderen



Je bent op de eerste plaats inhoudelijk sterk op het gebied van geohydrologie (onder meer grondwatermonitoring, tijdreeksanalyse en grondwatermodellering). Met jouw uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden stem jij regelmatig en efficiënt af met collega’s, medeoverheden en andere partijen binnen en buiten Rijkswaterstaat. Je kunt aantoonbaar laten zien dat je resultaat- en samenwerkingsgericht bent. Je pakt makkelijk zaken op en bent ondernemend.



Je weet complexe materie helder en eenvoudig uit te leggen aan anderen, zowel in overleggen als op papier. Ook weet je snel tot de kern van complexe opgaven door te dringen. Daarnaast heb je aantoonbaar inhoudelijke ervaring in het grondwaterwerkveld. Ervaring met grondwatermonitoring, tijdreeksanalyse (PASTAS, Menyanthes), BRO en grondwatermodellen (NHI, MODFLOW/IMOD) zien wij als een pre. Ook ervaring met programmeren (bv. Python, R), en kennis van de RWS werkwijzen (bv. IPM rollenmodel) en systematieken (zoals systems engineering) is een pre.

**PhD position in Social Psychology on ‘Behavioral change and collective action for climate action and energy transition'**  


School: Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences  

Department: Social Psychology  

Location: Tilburg  

Monthly full-time gross salary: €2.770 to a maximum of €3.539 gross per month for full time employment  

Full time equivalent: 0,8 FTE (32 hours per week)  

Duration of employment contract: 12 months, followed by 48 months  

Start date: October 1, 2024 (sooner or later upon mutual agreement)  

Closing date vacancy: August 30, 2024  

  

**Description of the PhD project**  

Human behavior plays an important role in climate change, and can thus also make a significant positive contribution to climate action and the energy transition. In the debate about climate action and the energy transition, there is a discourse on individual action and behavioral change on the one hand, and a discourse on collective action, institutional change, and social innovation on the other. The former is about changes in lifestyle to reduce one's carbon footprint, including insulating one's home, installing solar panels and a heat pump, and buying an electric car. The latter is about changes in policy and legislation to meet climate and energy goals, through collectively organized solutions such as heat grids, but also about energy communities that enable collective and citizen-driven energy actions to support climate action and the energy transition.  

Rarely, these discourses are connected. Indeed, they are sometimes even perceived – and portrayed – as conflicting. This disconnection may, however, have serious implications for the effectiveness of climate action and the energy transition, and come at the expense of social equity and inclusion. There thus is a need for a synthesis, substantiated by interdisciplinary research in the social and behavioral sciences.  

This project hence aims to embrace both perspectives, by investigating the underlying logics of individual and collective action, and notably the ways through which the divide between individual and collective action can be counteracted. How can individual climate action and behavioral change for the energy transition be stimulated, whilst also organizing collective action and bringing about institutional change and social innovation? Addressing this question is urgent and important for scholars and societal stakeholders (e.g., local and regional governments, grid operators, consumer organizations) alike, and may contribute to both a better understanding of the role of human behavior in climate action and the energy transition as well as better informed policy and legislation backing individual and collective action.  


**Description of the Academic Collaborative Center for Climate and Energy**
The candidate will be embedded in the Department of Social Psychology within the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences (TSB). In addition, the research of the PhD project will take place within the context of the Academic Collaborative Center (ACC) for Climate and Energy, which is an interdisciplinary and university-wide center within Tilburg University. In the ACC, we study the societal dimension of climate action and the energy transition, including the social, psychological, legal, economic and political challenges encountered throughout the energy transition and in the achievement of climate goals. We work together with societal partners, including public institutions, industry, and other knowledge institutes, to map the problems encountered in the energy transition and to develop innovative solutions. As the ACC is a cross-faculty collaboration, you are expected to work with academics from other departments, faculties and institutions, as engaging in team science is core to our approach. The PhD project furthermore involves close transdisciplinary collaboration with non-academic partners such as local and regional governments, grid operators and consumer groups.  


**Your responsibilities**  

The main tasks will include:
* Writing a PhD thesis
* Planning and executing data collection (both secondary data and new data)
* Setting up experiments (lab, online or field) and surveys
* Executing basic and advanced data analysis
* Preparing scientific articles to be published in international journals
* Presenting at national and international scientific conferences
* Active participation in the Department of Social Psychology (e.g., by attending lecture series and departmental meetings).
* Active participation in the Academic Collaborative Center for Climate and Energy (e.g., by engaging with other researchers and societal partners).

  


**What you contribute**

We are looking for candidates who have:  


* An interest in conducting interdisciplinary research on the topic of behavioral change and collective action in the energy transition
* Demonstrated capacities to conduct quantitative research
* Advanced research skills (for example, experimental design, survey design, preregistration and other Open Science practices) and data analytical abilities (for example, meta-analysis, power-analysis, multilevel regression modeling)
* In-depth knowledge of statistical and programming tools (e.g., R, Stata, SPSS, Qualtrics)
* Proficiency in English at an academic level, including strong writing skills
* Excellent communication and cooperation skills and the willingness to work in a team
* Commitment to open science

**Your terms of employment**  

Your valuable contribution will be rewarded with attractive benefits and sufficient attention to work-life balance. Our offer includes:
* A position based on 0,8 FTE (32 hours per week)
* This is a vacancy that is temporarily funded on the basis of the National Education Program, in accordance with Article 2.3 paragraph 6 sub c of the CLA for Dutch Universities.

Researchers from outside the Netherlands may qualify for a tax-free allowance of 30% of their taxable salary if they meet the relevant conditions. The university applies for this allowance on their behalf.  


We aim for October 1, 2024 as starting date, but the exact date can be determined together.  


**Your work environment**  

You will work in a pleasant working environment; a green campus with plenty of facilities. At a leading, entrepreneurial, and innovative university in the humanities and social sciences.

The on-going EU-wide soil monitoring has already greatly improved knowledge of spatial and temporal dynamics of soils, at the continental scale. However, since there is no information on land management in the survey, the data has so far not been able to answer urgent questions on how farm management affects soil properties, and vice versa, how soil health impacts crop yield.  

  

In this postdoc you will work with a unique dataset of farm management data from hundreds of thousands of farms across Europe and link it with European soil monitoring data to answer the following questions:* Can spatial and temporal patterns in farm management intensity explain observed changes in soil properties, using the example of soil organic carbon stocks?
* In turn, how do indicators of soil health impact crop yield stability in the face of weather extremes?


Your duties and responsibilities include leading data analysis and writing of scientific publications, supervising master thesis students, and communicating results to non-academic stakeholders. You will work in the Soil Geography and Landscape Group, an interdisciplinary team of early and more advanced career scientists, and have the opportunity to develop networks within Wageningen University and Research and internationally.  

  

This position is for 2 years, the intended starting date is from 1 October 2024 (or on agreement). Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:* sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
* working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;
* the option to accrue additional compensation / holiday hours by working more, per week;
* there is a strong focus on vitality, and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
* a fixed December bonus of 8.3%;
* excellent pension scheme.


In addition to these first-rate employee benefits, you will of course receive a good salary. Depending on your experience, we offer a competitive gross salary of between €3.226 and €5.090 for a full-time working week of 38 hours, in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreements for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU) (scale 10. Additionally, a contract for 0.8 FTE can be discussed.

We are offering a unique position in an international environment with a pleasant and open working atmosphere.

**Faculteit/Dienst:** Faculteit der Natuurw., Wiskunde & Informatica
**Opleidingsniveau:** Master
**Functie type:** Promotieplaats
**Sluitingsdatum:** 15.08.2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13240
Are you wholeheartedly interested in the psychology of stress resilience, student mental health and exercise-based interventions? Are you a future researcher by heart, do you enjoy (learning about) statistical analyses of complex datasets, and is it your ambition to become a top-tier researcher? Then you might be the perfect candidate that we need for the project ‘Stress Tolerance and Resilience by Integrating Digital and Exercise training-based interventions for Mental Health of Dutch students’ (STRIDE)!  


**What are you going to do?**  

  

Every year, thousands of young adults in the Netherlands enrol at a university or university of applied sciences and often move to an urban environment. Exposure to multiple potential stressors during this new life phase is inevitable, including moving away from the parental home and environment, financial and academic challenges, and the challenge of forming a new social network. Chronic exposure to stress is a potent risk factor for the development of stress-related mood disorders, and many students are indeed at risk for developing anxiety and depression. Therefore, the central aim of the STRIDE project is to promote stress resilience in students. To this end, we will develop exercise interventions, as regular exercise is a low-cost behavioural strategy that is widely acknowledged to benefit mental health.  


In the first part of the project, you will adopt a complex systems approach to shed light on the complex interplay between physical activity/exercise training, depression, anxiety,  

stress, substance use, urbanicity, socioeconomic status, and relevant (personality/environmental/lifestyle) factors. To this end, you will analyse a large-scale data set for physical activity patterns in Dutch student populations to determine the relation with mental health. Furthermore, you will collaborate with local student sports centres to determine if active membership of a university sports centre is associated with better academic performance or mental health.  


Sequentially, you will develop a personalised, habit-based exercise training intervention for engendering long-lasting behaviour change and enduring beneficial effects on stress resilience and mental health. This exercise training intervention will initially be offered via the online Caring Universities platform to students at Amsterdam-based teaching institutes in collaboration with two Amsterdam-based student sports centres. Upon successful implementation, the exercise training intervention will be rolled out nationally to other Dutch student sports centres to help students with mental health problems on a national level.  


To achieve these ambitious aims, you will work together with the Caring Universities consortium and two Amsterdam-based student sports centres. You will be appointed within the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS) of the Faculty of Science, where dr. Joram Mul will be your daily supervisor, and you will collaborate closely with the other members of the STRIDE team (dr. Sanne de Wit, dr. Sascha Struijs and prof. Paul Lucassen). You will also become a member of the Centre for Urban Mental Health (UMH). UMH is the largest Research Priority Area of the University of Amsterdam, bringing together unique multidisciplinary research teams. UMH is embedded within three faculties of the University of Amsterdam and is unified by the emerging knowledge and skills available from the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, the Faculty of Medicine, and the Faculty of Science, together with the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS, UvA). This collaboration brings together unique multidisciplinary research teams and stakeholders from the Amsterdam region.  


You will take an active role in departmental activities, including attending and presenting at regular seminars. You will also spend one day per week (Wednesdays) at the Institute for Advanced Study and take part in discussions and presentations together with other interdisciplinary teams that are working on UMH projects that aim to promote urban mental health.  


**Tasks and responsibilities**  

  

You are expected to:  

* to complete a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four years;
* design and conduct research studies;
* perform (quantitative) data analyses;
* communicate about your research in presentations, at scientific conferences, and via academic publications in

 peer-reviewed international journals;  

* do a small amount (0.1fte) of research-related teaching (e.g., supervision of bachelor/master theses);
* actively take part in activities and seminars at SILS and IAS;
* present your results at seminars and (inter)national conferences.
  


**Your experience and profile**  

  

You are an aspiring researcher with a strong interest in the psychology of behaviour change, exercise and (student) mental health. You are excited about the challenge of developing exercise interventions to promote mental health in students and investigating their effectiveness as well as identifying mechanisms of action. You enjoy presenting your work to colleagues, writing scientific papers, and do not shy away from complex statistical analyses. Finally, you view yourself as someone thriving in a research team, and you like to work in interdisciplinary contexts.  


You have:  

* a MSc degree in psychology or a related discipline;
* outstanding organisational skills, high conscientiousness, flexibility, communication skills, and a proactive and collaborative attitude;
* experience with R (statistical analysis) and willingness (to learn) to conduct network analysis;
* good social and communication skills and know how to motivate potential research participants;
* excellent oral and written communication skills in English;
* readiness to participate in interdisciplinary cooperation.
  


Speaking Dutch is not a requirement, but this ability would benefit the project substantially.  


**Our offer**  

  

A temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). The preferred starting date is 1 November 2024. This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students.  


Based on a full-time appointment (38 hours per week) the gross monthly salary will range from €2.770 in the first year to €3.539 (scale P) in the last year. This does not include 8% holiday allowance and 8,3% year-end allowance. The Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands is applicable.  


Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment at Science Park we offer you multiple fringe benefits:  

* 232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime);

* the possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;
* help with housing for a studio or small apartment when you’re moving from abroad.
  


**About us**  

  

The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences is one of the Faculty of Science’s largest institutes. Its approximately 240 scientists and staff members work in 19 research groups that perform excellent research centered on four themes: Neurosciences, Cell & Systems Biology, Microbiology and Green Life Sciences.  


You will be embedded in the Brain Plasticity group. The project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, the Faculty of Science (UvA-FNWI), the Department of Psychology, Faculty of Behavioral and Social Sciences (UvA-FMG) and the department of Clinical, Neuro- & Developmental Psychology of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU-FGB).  


The Centre for Urban Mental Health (UMH) is the largest interdisciplinary Research Priority Area of the University of Amsterdam. It aims to find new pathways to improve mental health in the city that consider the complexities and dynamics of mental health problems and mental health disorders in an urban environment. UMH is embedded within three faculties of the University of Amsterdam and is unified by the emerging knowledge and skills available from the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, the Faculty of Medicine, and the Faculty of Science, together with the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS, UvA). This collaboration brings together unique multidisciplinary research teams and stakeholders from the Amsterdam region.  


The general emphasis in the 2nd funding period (2024-2028) lies in developing and testing innovative interventions, aimed at different levels operating within an UMH context, i.e., from the individual to small social systems, such as family interventions up to urban level interventions on neighbourhoods, and up to a more global urban level, such as policy interventions. UMH is managed by three directors - prof. dr. Claudi Bockting, prof. dr. Reinout Wiers and dr. Harm Krugers - and is supported by a coordinator and an assistant. Most meetings for UMH are held on Wednesdays at the Institute for Advanced Study in the centre of Amsterdam.  


All UMH team members, thus PhD candidates, PostDocs as well as their supervisors, are expected to not only work on their own projects, but to also work on the UMH framework collaboratively, and are expected to prioritise time to participate in weekly UMH sessions at the IAS, such as PhD meetings, PI meetings and Lecture series. The UMH PhD candidate is thus expected to be an active member of the centre and the community associated with the centre.  


In the Caring Universities consortium, six universities (UvA, VU, Leiden, Utrecht, Maastricht, Erasmus) and three universities of applied sciences (Avans, Rotterdam, InHolland) work together to understand, prevent and effectively reduce psychological and psychosocial problems in students.

Are you interested in how brain-wide networks contribute to cognition across the lifespan? And how events early in life may affect neuronal circuits and thereby behavior later in life? This project aims to better understand the neuronal mechanisms of how the cerebellum computes and adapts internal models to optimally behave in a dynamic and social environment.  


You will study this using a systems neuroscience approach, combining in vivo electrophysiology (Neuropixels) from cerebellum and forebrain areas with behavioral paradigms in rodents. Specifically, you will investigate neuronal circuits in the cerebellum and connected brain areas to various external factors, ranging from social touch to early cannabis exposure (a collaboration with Dr. Rixt van der Veen, Brain Plasticity Group).  


Behavior paradigms include social interactions between conspecifics, and tickling rodents to expose them to expected and unexpected social touch. You will then investigate how exposure to these external factors influence cognitive and motor skills later in life. In addition to performing behavioral experiments and implantation of silicon probes for recordings, analysis of behavior and of the electrophysiological recordings will be a substantial part of this project.  


This project is part of the Cellular and Circuit Neuroscience research line headed by Dr. Marlies Oostland. The research line is embedded in the Cellular and Computational Neuroscience Group at the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS, Faculty of Science). The Cellular and Computational Neuroscience Group investigates functional and structural connectivity in the brain by using electrophysiology and imaging techniques to study how synaptic strength and network activity are changed from developmental stages to the aged brain. You will be supervised by Dr. Marlies Oostland and Prof. Helmut Kessels.

The WSG group focuses on the water-food-climate nexus, a critical area of research within the Earth Systems and Global Change (ESC) framework. . We study interactions between water resources and crop production as modulated by climate change and climate variability. To this end we develop and use models integrating crop development, growth, nutrient uptake and transpiration, both in potential and water or nutrient limited conditions. We couple these two models simulating water availability from surface and ground water, including irrigation systems and reservoirs (VIC), as well as water quality aspects. With such coupled models we study contemporary, near- and far-future mutual potentials and constraints, globally as well as for large basins and regions.  

  

We also aim to contribute to solutions by quantifying the effects of a diversity of potential adaptation strategies to increase magnitude and resilience of crop production at scales ranging from farm to globe. Climate time scales can be historic to real time (reanalysis), seasonal forecasts as well climate change scenarios (CMIP6). We engage with stakeholders worldwide to empower them to transition towards a more sustainable future.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for:

**PhD candidate in Network Science (4 years)**


**About this position**  

Leiden University’s computer science department (LIACS), part of the Faculty of Science, is seeking an enthusiastic and well-qualified PhD candidate in network science, a field also referred to as complex networks or social network analysis. The position is for 4 years and is fully funded.  

The position is part of SSHOC-NL, a five-year national consortium project on advancing methods and infrastructure in, among others, the social sciences. Within SSHOC-NL Leiden University and University of Amsterdam jointly lead the work on large-scale social network analysis, which is the focus of this PhD position. While the position offers a certain degree of freedom in terms of the precise research direction, as part of the broader consortium project, the candidate will be asked to work on community detection in large-scale dynamic networks, and how this is affected by aggregation of the network. This ties into a broader objective of the consortium in which the aim is to understand how privacy-sensitive population-scale (network) data, possibly at an aggregated level, can be made accessible and interoperable.


The candidate will be part of the Platform for Large-scale Analysis of Networks Netherlands (PLANET-NL) interdisciplinary group of researchers in both computer science and social science, which will meet regularly as part of the broader consortium project. One particular object of study of this group, and thus possibly also for the candidate, is the multi-layer population-scale social network data of the Netherlands, featuring twelve years of longitudinal network data on all seventeen million inhabitants of the Netherlands and their family, work, school, neighbor and household ties (see, e.g., https://www.popnet.io).


The candidate will be encouraged to collaborate on projects with other members of the Computational Network Science (CNS, https://cns.liacs.nl) group. Moreover, there are ample opportunities to collaborate with other research groups at LIACS in for example data science, machine learning, text mining and algorithm design. It is furthermore possible to get engaged in (limited) BSc and MSc student (co-)supervision, as well as minor scientific organizational activities. Additionally, there are plenty of opportunities for interaction and collaboration, for example at the Faculty of Science through the Leiden Complex Networks Network (LCN2, https://lcn2.leidenuniv.nl) and nationally through the Dutch Network Science Society (https://www.netsci.nl).


To apply, candidates are required to submit, in addition to an academic CV, a brief motivation letter of at most 2 pages, including a short description of a research idea that the candidate would want to work on in light of this particular position.

**Key responsibilities**

* Conducting research in the area of network science, leading to peer-reviewed publications.
* Writing an article-based PhD thesis within the duration of the position.
* Participating in a broader national computational social science consortium project.
* Limited involvement in co-supervising BSc and MSc students and engaging in minor local organizational activities.
* Assist in relevant teaching activities.

**Required qualifications**

* A MSc\* in computer science or a related field (e.g., mathematics, physics or computational social science), ideally with experience (e.g., through a MSc thesis) on a networks-related topic.
* Experience with programming in Python and/or C++ and/or R, preferably with some large-scale network analysis experience.
* Willingness and ability to work in an interdisciplinary setting working across computer science and social sciences.
* Excellent proficiency of the English language.
* Able to work independently and in a team.
* An academic, creative and curious mindset.
* : excellent candidates not (yet) (fully) past the MSc phase, but sufficiently close to graduation, are also invited to apply.

Ben jij een kinderfysiotherapeut die gewend is om buiten de kaders van het normale denken te opereren. Heb jij ervaring met Artificial Intelligence (AI) en krijg je energie van het creëren van (technische) oplossingen voor complexe praktijk problemen.


Dan zijn we op zoek naar jou!


In het kader van een 2-jarig wetenschappelijk onderzoeksproject is het consortium van Hogeschool Zuyd, Hogeschool Rotterdam en het Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis opzoek naar een docent-onderzoeker (0,6 FTE).

*Achtergronden*


Het succesvol integreren van eHealth-innovaties, is van vitaal belang voor het verbeteren van de zorgkwaliteit en toegankelijkheid. Thuismeten is een van de innovaties die kan bijdragen aan een efficiëntere zorgverlening en een betere toegankelijkheid. Onderzoek toont aan dat digitaal thuis meten aanzienlijke voordelen biedt, waaronder een betere patiëntervaring, meer regie over het zorgproces, verbeterde veiligheid en kostenbesparingen. Juveniele dermatomyositis (JDM), een zeldzame ziekte bij kinderen, zou aanzienlijke voordelen kunnen halen uit thuismeten. Momenteel zijn monitoringtools zoals de Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) alleen beschikbaar in gespecialiseerde medische centra, wat frequente monitoring moeilijk maakt. Een veelbelovende ontwikkeling is het gebruik van AI-gebaseerde oplossingen voor real-time analyse van videobeelden. Deze ontwikkeling roept echter nog vragen op over acceptatie en betrouwbaarheid en inzetbaarheid. Daarom heeft Zuyd Hogeschool (Lectoraat Dataintelligence) samen met de kennis en praktijk partners Kinderfysiotherapie (Hogeschool Rotterdam), het Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis en eerstelijnskinderfysiotherapeuten tot de volgende vraagstelling gekomen: Hoe kunnen we de implementatie van betrouwbare AI-gebaseerde thuismetingsoplossingen bevorderen om meer frequente en consistente ziekte monitoring mogelijk te maken, de fysiotherapeutische behandeling te optimaliseren en daarmee de kwaliteit van zorg voor kinderen met JDM te verbeteren?


### **Wat ga je doen?**



Dit project wordt uitgevoerd op de kruising tussen zorg, innovatie en technologie waarbij de beantwoording van de vraag een duidelijke co-creatieaanpak vereist, nauwe betrokkenheid van zorgprofessionals en richtlijnen om de kansen en uitdagingen van thuismeten met behulp van AI in de praktijk te adresseren. Als onderzoeker in dit project ben jij de verbindende factor die bijdraagt aan het ontwikkelen van de applicatie (in samenwerking met professionals in de data-technologie), handelingskaders ontwikkeld voor de toepassing van de ontwikkelde AI applicatie (in samenwerking met kinderfysiotherapeuten) en het valideren en testen van het algoritme in de praktijk. Uiteindelijk moet dit project niet alleen leiden tot een applicatie voor de beroepspraktijk, maar ook leiden tot kaders voor het verantwoord en gewetensvol handelen met AI in de zorg. Het project betreft een periode van twee jaar en een promotie behoort tot de mogelijkheden.


### **Ben jij wie we zoeken?**



De geschikte kandidaat is een afgestudeerde kinderfysiotherapeut (of in de afrondende fase) met een affiniteit met data-technologie. Ervaring met klinische bewegingsanalyse aangevuld met basiskennis in programmeren (Python, R, Matlab) is een pre. De bereidheid om deze vaardigheden verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en implementatie is voorwaardelijk. Het verzorgen van scholing en onderwijs in het kader van het project kunnen tot de taken behoren. De geschikte kandidaat beschouwt zich als een teamspeler met uitstekende organisatie vaardigheden die energie krijgt van het samenwerken met diverse stakeholders uit verschillende domeinen.


### **Wat bieden we jou?**

Gezamenlijk zetten ons ruim 1.500 professionals zich dagelijks in voor ruim 65.000 werkgevers en ruim 1,5 miljoen werkenden om gezond, gemotiveerd en competent aan het werk te zijn en blijven. En dat levert een schat aan data op waar wij ons als afdeling Research & Development graag in vastbijten en deze vertalen in vernieuwende inzichten en datagedreven innovaties met inzet van AI.**



**Hoe ga je meer betekenen als Data Scientist**
-----------------------------------------------


Als Data Scientist bij HumanTotalCare denk je iedere dag vanuit jouw kennis en kunde mee over manieren waarop onze organisatie en professionals met behulp van data effectiever kunnen werken, en hoe we meer kunnen betekenen voor werknemers en werkgevers. Nu en straks.


Samen met je R&D collega’s en andere professionals uit de hele organisatie ontwikkel je concepten en ideeën die, via een innovatieproces met experimenten en pilots, tot schaalbare oplossingen voor de collega’s en klanten leiden. Dit doe je niet alleen en van achter je bureau, maar samen met je directe collega’s en in dialoog met de business.


Wij zijn er om in de praktijk belangrijk te zijn, en zetten hiervoor data en technologie samen met onze domeinkennis in. Denk aan het ontwikkelen van modellen voor beslisondersteuning in het verzuimproces, waarmee we het verschil maken door de juiste interventie op het juiste moment te initiëren. Of aan een datagedreven preventieproces waardoor een diagnose of prognose sneller gesteld kan worden en preventieve acties gerichter kunnen worden geadviseerd. Maar ook aan inzet van AI op de werkplek waarmee we onze professionals kunnen ondersteunen met efficiënte werkprocessen. We willen onze toegevoegde waarde meetbaar maken en monitoren onze KPI’s. Zo blijven we samen leren om onze processen en diensten te verbeteren.  



**Met wie ga je meer betekenen**
--------------------------------


Je wordt onderdeel van het veelzijdige R&D team, bestaande uit ongeveer 15 vaste collega’s. Met een mooie mix van consultants, research & business development, data scientists, project support medewerkers en machine learning engineers, aangevuld met een flexibele schil van onderzoeksassistenten, studenten en scientist practitioners ga jij impact maken.


Met een grote diversiteit aan kennis en kunde brengen wij data, wetenschap, technologie en praktijk bij elkaar. Dit doen we in nauwe samenwerking met collega’s van Business Intelligence, staf en IT. De organisatie weet ons goed te vinden en we hebben toegang tot een breed scala aan expertise van onze arbo-professionals. Van bedrijfsartsen tot arbeids- en organisatiedeskundigen en van ergonomen tot psychologen.



### **Wat is écht leuk aan deze baan**

* We hebben een schatkist vol relevante data. Van procesdata, verzuimdata, vragenlijsten tot vrije tekst of gebruik van onze platformen. Over onze dienstverlening heen, zowel inhoudelijke data rondom gezondheid van werknemers als procesinformatie en KPI’s (bijv. klanttevredenheid, omzet). Er is nog genoeg te ontginnen en veel ruimte voor jouw ideeën. Uiteraard binnen de kaders van de wet, privacy staat hoog bij ons in het vaandel.
* Jouw werk maakt echt verschil voor werkend Nederland. Wat je bedenkt kan ook echt in productie worden gebracht. Daarbij is er veel draagvlak binnen de organisatie voor wat je doet.
* Je wordt onderdeel van een hecht team, en elke dinsdag neem je deel aan de R&D dag met updates, demo’s of innovatiesessies.
* Je bepaalt voor een groot deel zelf waar je jouw energie in steekt en de meeste toegevoegde waarde ziet. Je krijgt veel autonomie om je werk in te richten zoals jij dat wilt. Zo vormt de functie zich naar jouw expertise en ambitie.

### **Is er ook iets minder leuk**


Het vakgebied is volop in ontwikkeling. Soms willen we te snel of moeten we eerst de data nog ontsluiten. Het is niet altijd een gespreid bedje en je bent nog aan het bouwen van jouw positie als Data Scientist binnen de organisatie. Maar met een flinke dosis doorzettingskracht en een goed verhaal kom je echt al een heel eind.



**Wat neem je mee**
-------------------


Nieuwsgierigheid en een beetje vakidiotie. Jij bent op de hoogte van de laatste inhoudelijke en technologische ontwikkelingen. En komt er weer wat interessants voorbij, dan maak jij je dit snel eigen. Je experimenteert met de mogelijke toepassing(en) hiervan. Je snapt de interactie tussen hardware en software en bedenkt graag dingen die echt een bijdrage leveren aan de praktijk. Daarbij heb je affiniteit met ons vakgebied van o.a. werk, gezondheid en gedragsverandering. En je weet hoe je jouw boodschap over de bühne moet krijgen. Complexe materie kun je uitleggen in de taal van je gesprekspartner, waar deze zich ook in de organisatie bevindt.


Verder vragen we het volgende:

* Een relevante universitaire opleiding (data/computer science of statistiek en methoden).
* Bij voorkeur minimaal 5 jaren relevante werkervaring als Data analist of Data Scientist en je hebt eerder gewerkt met grote hoeveelheden data, inclusief data cleaning.
* Je bent goed thuis in statistiek en onderzoeksmethoden.
* Je kunt uitstekend uit de voeten met Python, en liefst ook met een andere programmeertaal zoals R of Java.
* Je hebt ervaring met machine learning en bij voorkeur ook met andere data-analyse technieken, zoals simulatie, deep learning, en Natural Language Processing.
* Het is een pré als je ervaring hebt met infrastructuur en softwarearchitectuur die nodig zijn om modellen in softwareproductie te kunnen integreren (bijv. Docker, Kubernetes, microservices en REST API’s).
* De werkzaamheden en de documentatie zijn grotendeels in het Engels. Omdat je data vertaalt naar de business in onze organisatie, is het van belang dat je voldoende Nederlands spreekt en schrijft (B2).

**Wat krijg je ervoor terug**
-----------------------------


Als HumanTotalCare zetten we ons in voor een gezond, gemotiveerd en competent werkend Nederland. Vanuit onze merken adviseren en ondersteunen we werkgevers en werkenden gedurende hun hele werkzame leven. Zo zijn we van betekenis voor werkenden, organisaties en onze maatschappij. En wat we naar buiten beloven, doen we ook intern. We bieden je dan ook:

* **Een open, informele werksfeer.** We doen het voor, door en met elkaar.

Then we have an opportunity for you.

  



**Job Description**  

In the plastic packaging value chain, there is only limited information available on the plastics in that chain to assess circularity and recyclability goals, especially the use of post-consumer recyclates (PCR) in packaging.

  


Quality specifications, monitoring, and standardisation of materials are common in certain industries like chemistry and pharma but are, at this point, only in an infancy state in plastic waste management. A major challenge when it comes to mechanical recycling of plastics is that the quality of the material is not monitored throughout the whole process. Inline monitoring is however essential for predicting the final quality of PCR.

  


In the MoQuP-R project, we focus on the necessary quality monitoring tools and the application of existing models related to the prediction of recyclate quality in order to increase the use of PCR in packaging. In this project your responsibilities will entail:


* Review literature to identify potential inline analytical methods to monitor quality parameters.
* Adapt laboratory and/or offline analytical techniques to be used inline in polymer processing equipment.
* Propose and execute design changes to polymer processing equipment to enable inline measurements.
* Design experiments using polymer processing equipment and post-consumer plastics to apply and develop monitoring tools.
* Evaluate the different methods in relation to PCR quality.
* Manage a work package in the MoQuP-R project.
* Present your work at international conferences, MoQuP-R consortium meetings, and other events and write scientific papers for international peer-reviewed journals.
* Provide teaching assistance and/or supervision of researchers and students.

  




As a Postdoctoral Researcher you will work in the Circular Plastics team in the Faculty of Science and Engineering located at Brightlands Chemelot Campus in Geleen. You will become part of a young international research group, specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics with a strong polymer science background. Your will work together with Rudinei Fiorio on this exciting topic.

  


**Requirements**  

We expect you to have the following experience, knowledge, and skills:


* A PhD degree in mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, process analysis, mechatronics, or similar;
* Advanced skills in CAD and interfacing sensor data to analysis software (e.g. Python, Matlab, Simulink);
* Good knowledge on analytical techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, GCMS;
* Skills in polymer processing;
* Experience with industry collaborations is considered advantageous;
* Proficiency in both written and spoken English.

  




**What we offer**  

**As** **a Postdoctoral Researcher** **at the** **Faculty of Science & Engineering****, you will be employed by the most international university in the Netherlands, located in the beautiful city of Maastricht. In addition, we offer you:**


* Good employment conditions. The position is graded in scale 11 according to UFO profile Researche, with corresponding salary based on experience ranging from €4332,00 and €5929,00 gross per month (based on a full-time employment of 38 hours per week). In addition to the monthly salary, an 8.0% holiday allowance and an 8.3% year-end bonus apply.
* An employment contract for a period of 24 months with a scope of 1.0 FTE.
* At Maastricht University, the well-being of our employees is of utmost importance, we offer flexible working hours and the possibility to work partly from home if the nature of your position allows it. You will receive a monthly commuting and internet allowance for this.

HBO BACHELOR
**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Als analist cybercrime ben je verantwoordelijk voor strategische en tactische beeldvorming voor intelligence en opsporing en het maken van veiligheidsanalyses op het gebied van cybercrime. Je hebt een coachende en organiserende rol ten aanzien van de andere analist(en) en samen met andere domeinexperts zorg je voor de juiste duiding, fenomeenbeelden en voorstellen voor interventies. Je gebruikt grote hoeveelheden informatie die je, in samenwerking met relevante partners, omzet in intelligence ter bestrijding van complexe en (inter)nationale cybercriminaliteit.


Uit diverse bronnen verzamel en combineer je informatie over digitale entiteiten zoals IP-adressen, personen, bedrijven en organisaties en geeft hier duiding aan. Je brengt informatiestromen in kaart en je beschrijft kenmerken van verdachten en criminele samenwerkingsverbanden. Je herkent afwijkende patronen en ontwikkelingen op het gebied van cybercrime, signaleert interventiekansen en adviseert over een integrale aanpak. Jouw bevindingen leg je helder en gestructureerd vast in intelligenceproducten zoals fenomeen- en veiligheidsbeelden, monitorberichten, informatierapporten en onderzoeksvoorstellen. Dit doe je op begrijpelijke wijze zodat ook minder gespecialiseerde in- en externe partners aangezet worden tot actie op dit thema. Je brengt als intermediair vraag en aanbod bij elkaar en formuleert voorstellen tot verbeteringen in het analyseproces.


Je initieert, bouwt, onderhoudt en regisseert op inhoudelijke samenwerking vanuit het regionale en (inter)nationale intelligence(cyber)netwerk. Vanuit het cyberbeeld haal je, samen met andere analisten van de Dienst Landelijke Intelligence Organisatie (DLIO), de voor Nederland belangrijke fenomenen, die je verder uitwerkt. Je bent ambassadeur voor het thema cybercrime waarbij de landelijke focuslijnen liggen op Ransomware, DDOS, Bankphising en Remote access trojans.


**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


Je wordt geplaatst bij het Team Analyse & Onderzoek van de Dienst Regionale Intelligence Organisatie (DRIO) van waaruit je gaat werken bij het Team Cybercrime in Amsterdam. Voor de aanpak van cybercrime zijn er in elke eenheid cybercrimeteams binnen de Dienst Regionale Recherche (DRR) gepositioneerd. De DRR bestaat uit de afdelingen Generieke Opsporing, Thematische Opsporing, Vreemdelingenpolitie en Specialistische Ondersteuning. In deze unieke constructie wordt op basis van gelijkwaardigheid tussen deze twee organisatieonderdelen samengewerkt vanuit een gezamenlijke opdracht en met wisselend leiderschap.


Het Team Cybercrime is hét team van de toekomst! In nauwe samenwerking met de tien cybercrimeteams van de overige eenheden, het Team High Tech Crime (THTC) van de Landelijke Eenheid en het analysecluster van het Landelijk Operationeel Cybercrime Overleg (LOCO) maakt het deel uit van een uniek nationaal netwerk op het vakgebied en brede bestrijding van cybercrime. Onderzoeken naar onder andere ransomware, DDoS aanvallen, malware, hacking, bulletproof hosting is de core business van het Team Cybercrime. Het team fungeert daarnaast ook als motorblok in het cybercrimenetwerk van de regionale Eenheid Amsterdam, waarbij het in nauwe verbinding staat met basisteams, districtelijke rechercheteams en opsporingsteams van de DRR.


Het Team Cybercrime is een multidisciplinair operationeel team met expertise op digitaal, intelligence, tactiek en financieel gebied. Het team verricht vanuit nationale samenhang en gezamenlijke aanpak op offensieve en creatieve wijze projectmatige en complexe (fenomeen)onderzoeken en interventies naar nationale en internationale vormen van cybercrime. Ook het aan de voorkant, veelal samen met publiek-private partners, verstoren of stoppen van criminele processen of het nemen van preventieve maatregelen hoort bij deze aanpak. Op het Team Cybercrime werkt men vanuit vertrouwen en is een veilige werkomgeving een kernwaarde. Het team gaat uit van de kennis en kunde van de teamleden. Daarin ligt de kracht van het team. Ieder teamlid draagt vanuit zijn eigen vakgebied bij aan het resultaat en wordt naar waarde geschat. Het Team Cybercrime is divers, dynamisch en creatief met een hoog werktempo en een grote drive om van betekenis te zijn en door te ontwikkelen op het vakgebied.


**Wie ben jij?**
----------------


Vanzelfsprekend ben je analytisch en motiverend ijzersterk en kun je methodologisch verantwoord informatie uit verschillende bronnen met elkaar in verband brengen. Je hebt daarbij ervaring met zowel kwantitatieve als kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethoden.

Vraagstukken rafel je uiteen, je weet hoofd- van bijzaken te onderscheiden, legt verbanden en kunt de juiste conclusies trekken. Verder ben je in staat om, in samenwerking met dataspecialisten, reduceermodellen te bedenken om tot fenomenen en/of targets te komen.

**Jouw uitdaging**  

In deze rol ligt de focus op data-analyse en ondersteuning van de verschillende divisies op het gebied van KPI's, dashboards en alles wat te maken heeft met de stroom van cijfers.

Het is daarbij belangrijk om de prioriteiten goed in te schatten en een planning te maken, zodat alles op tijd afkomt. Soms is het wel even schakelen tussen alle verschillende afdelingen en processen, maar dit maakt het werken bij CBR extra leuk en interessant.

Als Business Analyst in het planningsdomein speel je een cruciale rol in de doorontwikkeling van één van de kernprocessen van Ampère. Je bent betrokken bij zowel kleine als grote projecten die gericht zijn op het forecasten van de pakketaantallen en benodigde resources, maar ook projecten rondom daadwerkelijke routeplanning. In deze rol maak je deel uit van het Planning & Control team, waarbij je samen met je collega’s werkt aan strategische, tactische en operationele vraagstukken.  



  

**Dit ga je doen**


Bij Ampère, een logistieke tech start-up van bol.com, staat planning centraal als een van onze kernprocessen. Als Business Analyst duik je diep in onze BigQuery omgeving om de juiste data te verzamelen en inzichten hieruit te genereren. Vanuit daar ga je in gesprek met gebruikers om problemen te identificeren. Je vertaalt deze problemen naar de Development teams, en werkt samen een bruikbare oplossing uit, die je vervolgens grondig test voordat ze live gaan. Voor grootschalige projecten treed je op als projectmanager, waarbij je consensus bereikt met stakeholders, realistische planningen opstelt, risico's inschat en voortgang boekt op verschillende projecten.


Daarnaast werk je samen met ons net gestarte data science team, waarmee je bezig gaat houden om voorspellingen te doen over onze operatie, zoals de verwachtte pakketaantallen of de benodigde voertuigen. Hierin ben jij de spil tussen het data science team en de behoeftes vanuit de business.  



  

Als laatste werk je ook samen met de Development teams om technische oplossingen voor de back-end systemen uit te werken. Hierbij houd je altijd de gebruiker in het achterhoofd: alleen zo bouwen we het beste product. Na de ontwikkeling van het product zorg je ervoor dat het uitvoerig wordt getest door collega's van Implementatie, live wordt gebracht en achteraf wordt geëvalueerd met de gebruikers.  



  

**Hierbij k****omen o.a. de volgende verantwoordelijkheden bij kijken**  



* Leiden van innovatieprojecten
* Analyseren van onze data om inzichten te verkrijgen voor projecten
* Op basis van onze data KPI’s bepalen
* Onderzoeken van wensen samen met gebruikers
* Het beïnvloeden van stakeholders in verschillende lagen en richting geven aan scope en aanpak van projecten
* Vertalen van business requirements naar IT requirements voor het scrum team
* Voorbereiden en faciliteren van refinement sessies met het scrum team
* Het brengen van voorstellen naar het MT van Ampère
* Testen, implementeren en overdragen van innovatieprojecten
* Ontwikkelen van dashboards voor zowel onze operationele als innovatieafdeling

Met een innovatieve geest ben je altijd op zoek naar nieuwe technieken om toe te passen, zo heb je bijvoorbeeld interesse in data science of AI. Dankzij je ervaring in projectmanagement en het vermogen om een duidelijke scope te bepalen, navigeer je moeiteloos door complexe taken. Stakeholdermanagement? Ook dat doe jij fluitend.

You will be joining our team at an interesting moment: in the midst of the energy transition, which you will come face-to-face with in every fibre of our organization. Smart maintenance, energy feedback systems, gas-free homes, wind power generation, and much more: we are working hard every day to make it all possible. This means a whole universe of processes to which you can make a valuable contribution.  

  

You will work in the five-strong HR team of the ICT Staven. This department is responsible for ICT services for all Enexis staff departments. Your ultimate goal with this team is to offer support to the main HR processes with modules from Succesfactors, combined with add-ons and custom ICT solutions. Given that our organisation is active from Groningen to Maastricht, your colleagues come from all different corners of the country. As a team, you normally get together once a week. In addition, you will regularly join in at the (now often digital) table with colleagues from HR. Without COVID-19 measures, you work pretty much half the time at your 'own' location, and the other half from home or other Enexis locations. At Enexis, all ICT teams work agile (SAFe) to deliver high-quality end products quickly and efficiently. Wherever you end up working in our organisation, you will find the same open and informal 'we culture' where everyone is willing to help each other. This is why many colleagues describe Enexis as a warm bath.

 **Job Description**  

As Succesfactors Information Analyst, you will help us fully transition from SAP HR to Succesfactors. Several HR processes are already in place. In 2022 we started migrating the HR processes for payroll, time, travel management and flexible benefits, among others. You will be responsible for developing and managing Succesfactors within Enexis, and will work closely with our HR department to this end. You analyse HR's information needs and come up with smart IT solutions and improvement proposals based on that analysis. You skilfully bridge the processes, systems and data in our organisation to keep things running smoothly. This is important work at a time when, as a grid operator, we need to make progress more than ever to maintain the momentum of the energy transition.

 **Job Requirements**  

This is you  

You speak the HR department's language, understand its goals and think along proactively as a flexible team player. Thanks to your strong analytical ability and creativity, you have no trouble working in an organisation with several systems under development. With your vision and communication skills you are persuasive and can work constructively in multidisciplinary teams.  

  

You also have:  

• bachelor's and/or master's degree;  

• Knowledge of HR processes;  

• At least 2 years working experience with SAP Succesfactors.

 **Salary and Benefits**  

In exchange for your energy, Enexis will take very good care of you. Here's what you can expect:  

• A gross monthly salary between € 4,358 and € 6,226 at the full-time (40 hours/week) rate.  

• This consists of a base salary in scale 15 between € 3,611 and € 5,158, supplemented with a personal budget (10%) and a 13th month (10.7%).  

• Vacation bonus in the amount of 8% of your gross salary.  

• We contribute 70% of your ABP Flexible Pension premium.  

• The option to define your own work week flexibly. We consider it vital for our employees to maintain a good balance between work and personal life. That means that if you need to bring your kids to school before work or simply want to start your day with a workout at the gym, that's just fine.  

• An annual vitality budget of €500. This can go towards things like gym membership or a consult by a nutritional coach.  

• Commute travel reimbursement and a mobility card with a 1st class public transportation subscription.  

• All the space you need for personal growth. Because this, too, is one of our top priorities. That means that if you want to attend a workshop or take a training course, chances are good that we will pay for it.  

  

Do we sound like a match for you?  

We prefer to invest in long-term relationships. To make sure that we're a match for each other, we conduct a screening. The details differ for each job and may include: an assessment and request for references, and a good conduct certificate (Dutch VOG). During your job interview we will brief you on the exact content of the screening process for your job.

-------------------


  
Help de juiste beslissingen te nemen over belangrijke vraagstukken, voor een betere en toegankelijkere rechtspraak!



De Rechtspraak is volop in beweging. Zo zetten we maximaal in op digitalisering en toegankelijkheid. Als business analist duik je in actuele vraagstukken en schets je daar een haarscherp beeld van. Hoe functioneert de rechtspraak? Waar kan het beter? En hoe? Zo leg je de basis voor weloverwogen beslissingen en belangrijke veranderingen. Een baan met een enorme maatschappelijke impact dus!



Hoe je werk eruit ziet



Je werkt vanuit een vakgroep met ruim 15 analisten. Elk kwartaal maken jullie een planning: welke onderwerpen pakken we aan en op welke rechtsgebieden? Onderzoeksopdrachten kunnen over applicaties, werkprocessen of data gaan. Zo zijn we onder meer bezig met ‘de tijdige rechtspraak’. Waar treedt vertraging op in het rechtspraakproces? En wat kunnen we eraan doen, zonder dat dit ten koste gaat van de kwaliteit?



Om input over vraagstukken op te halen, organiseer je workshops voor interne én externe partijen. Intern zijn dat bijvoorbeeld rechters, administraties of juristen. Extern kun je denken aan advocaten, deurwaarders of bewindvoerders. Die input werk je uit in een analyse die je valideert bij alle betrokkenen en eventueel een klankbordgroep die je zelf hebt opgezet. Vervolgens ga je om de tafel met onder meer IT-analisten en ontwikkelaars. Hoe geven we de nodige veranderingen vorm? Ook maak je kwantitatieve en kwalitatieve analyses van het gebruik van informatiesystemen. Hoe intensief is het gebruik? Hoe werkt het systeem en voldoet het aan de behoefte van de gebruikers?



Iedere week kom je samen met je collega-analisten om de voortgang te bespreken en kennis te delen. Op elke opdracht zitten twee analisten, dus je hebt altijd een directe sparringpartner. Jullie werken agile, maken gebruik van methodes zoals design thinking en business model canvas (BMC) en besteden veel aandacht aan de user experience. Kortom, echte business analisten van deze tijd! Als business analist werk je voor een specifiek rechtsgebied, in dit geval voor strafrecht.



Zie jij voor ieder vraagstuk meerdere oplossingen? Kun je goed met heel verschillende mensen overweg? En weet je dingen voor elkaar te krijgen? Dan zou jij wel eens de business analist kunnen zijn die wij zoeken!


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
Dit zijn de dingen waar je volgens het ideaalplaatje aan voldoet:



Je hebt een wo-opleiding op het raakvlak van bedrijfskunde of bestuurskunde en/of informatica afgerond;  

Je hebt ruime werkervaring;  

Je hebt aantoonbare ervaring met moderne methodes en technieken toe, zoals design thinking, business model canvas en ‘lean’ werken;  

Je bent een verbinder die de communicatie opzoekt;  

Ervaring met of kennis van het strafrecht is een pre;  

Kom je bij ons werken, dan vragen we ook altijd een Verklaring Omtrent het Gedrag (VOG).

Zo nemen wij een leidende rol in het aanjagen van de energietransitie. Het werven van nieuw talent speelt daarin een cruciale rol. Wij zijn op zoek naar een junior API Gateway Specialist voor ons kantoor met standplaats Arnhem.
### **Jouw bijdrage aan TenneT**

**Wie zijn wij?**


TenneT is een TSO, oftewel een netbeheerder. Als netbeheerder van Nederland en een groot deel van Duitsland bezitten en beheren wij 25.000 kilometer aan hoogspanningskabels. Onze belangrijkste taak: zorgen dat het licht blijft branden en dat elektriciteit altijd en overal met een druk op de knop beschikbaar is. Met onze leveringszekerheid van 99,99963% zijn wij een van de beste netbeheerders ter wereld.


Met behulp van innovatieve controlesystemen houden we het energienet in balans. Dat is belangrijk want als de vraag naar elektriciteit groter is dan het aanbod, kan een stroomstoring ontstaan. Voor het handhaven van die balans en het tegengaan van storingen zijn goede verbindingen nodig tussen elektriciteitsnetwerken in binnen- en buitenland. Ook speelt een robuuste en moderne IT dienstverlening hierin een belangrijke rol.

  

Daarom zoekt TenneT voor vast intern dienstverband een …

  



**Junior API Gateway Specialist**


**(0,8 - 1 FTE, Arnhem / Hybride)**

  



**In welke organisatie kom je te werken?**


Je komt terecht in de IT-afdeling *Infrastructure, Integration & Cloud* (“*IIC”*) van TenneT. Hier wordt elke dag in een goede sfeer met zijn allen hard gewerkt om vanuit IT de bedrijfsprocessen van TenneT te ondersteunen. We houden hierbij altijd het perspectief van de business in het vizier.


Als *IIC* leveren we IT4IT diensten: wij zijn verantwoordelijk voor het ontwikkelen en in de lucht houden van IT-infrastructuur en middleware diensten die de primaire processen van TenneT ondersteunen. Het Secure API Gateway team, waar je deel van gaat uitmaken, bouwt en beheert een platform die interne IT-applicaties van TenneT op een veilige manier ontsluit via API’s.

**Welk team ga jij versterken?**  

Het *Secure API Gateway Team* bestaat uit IT-specialisten met een achtergrond in het beschikbaar maken van API’s en authenticatieflows, daarvoor hebben ze naast kennis van API’s en API Gateways ook kennis van onder andere security en networking. Op het gebied van architectuur worden we ondersteund door onder andere domain- en solution architecten. Daarnaast werk je samen met andere ontwikkelteams binnen TenneT die hun API’s beschikbaar willen maken en is er afstemming met (externe) API afnemers.


Samen bouwen we aan het TenneT Managed Access Control (TMAC) platform. Dit platform heeft als doel om interne applicaties van TenneT op een veilige manier te ontsluiten. Als young professional IAM en API Gateway specialist is jouw rol om aan het TMAC-platform mee te bouwen en het te beheren.


Wij werken Agile, gebruiken het Scrum framework en hanteren twee-wekelijkse sprints voor ons ontwikkelwerk. Op deze manier zijn we vaak met stakeholders in gesprek om samen te bepalen hoe we optimaal waarde voor de business kunnen leveren. Door de lijntjes kort te houden, onderzoekend te zijn en veel vragen te stellen, krijgen we als team scherp wat belangrijk is. Voor beheer en ops werkzaamheden volgen we TenneT’s standaard changeprocess (ITIL). We zijn dus een DevOps team.


**Dit ga je bij ons doen en leren:**  

Als junior API Gateway specialist in ons team ben je voornamelijk bezig om ons integratieplatform door te ontwikkelen naar een volwassen product en beschikbaar te maken op meerdere platforms (managed cloud en on-premise). Dit doe je door de images te maken, te deployen en te configureren in Kubernetes, securityrichtlijnen te definiëren en toe te passen, en verschillende API’s beschikbaar te maken op de gateway. Daarnaast voegen we geregeld componenten toe die dienen voor monitoring, logging en CI/CD implementatie. Dit doe je in samenwerking met je teamleden, die jou zullen helpen om te groeien in deze rol.


Naast doorontwikkeling van ons product voeg je ook waarde toe door ons platform functioneel te beheren. Wij voorzien een groei in het aantal aangesloten klanten en een flinke stijging van het aantal API-calls per maand, en verwachten dan ook meer van dit soort *ops* taken.


Naast het door ontwikkelen van ons IT-product, werken we als team ook aan het verbeteren van onze eigen werkwijze en processen, hier doe je actief aan mee. Wij hebben ruimte voor een nieuwsgierige en leergierige junior developer/engineer die klaar is voor een mooie uitdaging op het gebied van API’s en IT4IT diensten.

  

### **Jouw profiel en achtergrond**

* **Wat is een must-have:**


	+ Je bent nieuwsgierig en leergierig op gebied van IT-integraties;
	+ Afgeronde ICT/IT opleiding of aantoonbaar structureel bezig met ICT/IT;
	+ HBO werk- en denkniveau;
	+ Je bent bereid om hybride te werken (soms op kantoor Arnhem, soms thuis);
	+ Je bent bereid om op termijn storingsdiensten te draaien;
	+ Goede beheersing van de Engelse taal;
	+ Positief ingesteld;
	+ Als teamspeler willen werken aan een gezamenlijk doel.**Kennisgebieden waar je over gaat leren en aan gaat bijdragen:**


TenneT vindt persoonlijke groei belangrijk. Daarom zijn onderstaande kennisgebieden geen harde functie-eisen. Wij beschouwen ze wel als zeer relevant en dus waardevol voor deze rol. Het is een pre als je deze kennis al hebt, maar niet noodzakelijk. Wel moet je ervoor openstaan om een aantal van deze vaardigheden te leren tijdens het werk bij TenneT.


	+ API’s en API Gateways;
	+ Kubernetes en Docker;
	+ State of the art deployment methoden middels CI/CD;
	+ Modern webdevelopment experience (i.e. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript);
	+ Cloudplatforms (momenteel voornamelijk Microsoft Azure);
	+ Functioneel beheer (bijv. ervaring met Topdesk of ITSM);
	+ Visualiseren van data (van dashboards zoals bijv. Grafana of Prometheus);
	+ Testing van API’s (bijv. met Postman);
	+ Beheer- en ontwikkelmethodes zoals DevOps, Agile, Scrum, Kanban, ITIL;
	+ Netwerk infrastructuur kennis.  



**Wat mag je van ons verwachten?**


	+ Een leuk en professioneel team om mee te werken;
	+ Hulp en begeleiding van senior IT-experts;
	+ Begeleiding en training naar behoefte;
	+ Als het klikt streven we naar zo snel mogelijk een vaste aanstelling;
	+ Zeer goede primaire en secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden;

Faculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science


The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position. In total, more than 1000 employees and 4,000 students work and study in this innovative environment.

**Nationaal Cyber Security Centrum**
------------------------------------



Het NCSC werkt aan een digitaal veilig Nederland. Door het tempo waarin het cybersecuritydomein zich ontwikkelt en de rol van het NCSC daarin, ligt er een flinke uitdaging voor de toekomst. Het is voor ons als hét kennisinstituut van cybersecurity in Nederland essentieel dat wij Nederland van kwalitatief hoogwaardige en actuele informatie voorzien, in crisistijd en daarbuiten. Deze kennis en kunde halen wij mede uit en delen wij ook weer met ons netwerk (overheden, bedrijfsleven en andere nationale en internationale partners). Op deze wijze proberen we tijdig in te springen op nieuw ontdekte kwetsbaarheden, aanvalscampagnes en ernstige ICT-verstoringen om deze te voorkomen en op te lossen. Als het toch misgaat beperken we op deze manier de impact.

------------------


The sector Twinscan Factory is responsible for the production and installation of Twinscan systems. The complete production process of the most advanced DUV machines takes place within this sector. The LAB organization is responsible to introduce New Product Introductions (NPI) as well as major Process Improvements in the FAB.


Key areas of responsibility


Resource Management

* Support LAB management in mid- and long-term capacity planning on workforce and tooling and provide advice in decision-making on capacity.

Performance Management

* Support LAB management in the design of performance metrics, such as KPI’s using multiple sources and data sets. Give constructive recommendations for improvement based on performance.
* Develop and implement BI dashboards, reports and tools to support business daily operations.
* Proactively analyze reports to communicate risks and opportunities and develop solutions which allow the company to make data informed decisions and operate more effectively.

General introduction


As a business process engineer, every day is different. One day is devoted by business reporting activities in which you gather information from several data sources such as SAP but also from team leaders. You use this information to calculate KPI’s and support management in their weekly operations and you see how the factory is managed. In the past you helped management to define those KPI’s and to cascade them over different levels of processes. Other days, you are the independent sparring partner for management when you calculate the required amount of FTE for a certain output plan you receive from the supply chain management department. However, the ad-hoc questions from managers keep you busy as well.


Working environment


You will be working along all levels of the factory, from management to the operators on the shopfloor, but you will have cross-sectoral stakeholders as well. Some tasks are more routinely and others are projects or ad-hoc requests, however almost always in-depth analysis comes together with people and change. Sometimes approaching several deadlines can be stressful, but in the end it is totally worth it when you celebrate the successes with your team. Your team consists of other business process engineers.

You will help the organization maintain, optimize and standardize its business processes. Finally you will act as an advisor regarding factory performance and recognizing improvement potential for that performance.

**People Leadership** To lead the DevEx organisation, you’re directly responsible for a small number of Engineering Managers and their teams, guiding the EMs in their growth and providing strategic direction.


**Managing Growth** Within the overall operations department, we aim to scale better than the overall growth of the business. You will contribute to this goal by enabling our engineers to deliver more. With our constantly evolving product landscape, you'll never run out of challenges!


**Strategic Leadership:** Responsibilities include leading the strategic direction of the team's engagements and collaborating with stakeholders. While not directly involved in software delivery, the role necessitates a profound understanding of technical architecture, potential challenges, and aligning the team's work with broader organisational goals.

 **Qualities we look for**

* Significant experience in leading Developer Experience roles, focusing on improving DORA metrics
* Leading leaders: The team currently has two engineering managers who will report to you
* Strong engineering background, bonus points if parts of our stack are included:


* C#/.NET with ASP.NET, C++, Typescript, Python or Go

* Proactive and proficient in communicating with stakeholders in English, ensuring clear and effective interactions
* Experience with a wide range of observability practices (SLOs, Dashboards, Alerts,..) for business-critical systems

 **What we offer**

* **Diverse and internationally distributed team**: joining our team means becoming part of a large, global community with people of more than 90 nationalities. We're more than just colleagues; we're a group of professionals with a shared mission to connect diverse cultures. Our global presence is growing–we've doubled in size nearly every year, with our employees based in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the US, and Japan, and we continue to expand our network.


* **Open communication, regular feedback**: as a language-focused company, we value the importance of clear, honest communication. We value smooth collaboration, direct and actionable feedback, and believe that leading with empathy makes us better together.


* **Remote work, flexible hours**: whether you're near or in our hubs in cities like Cologne, Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Austin, or Tokyo, or prefer the comfort of your own home, you decide where your office is. We offer remote opportunities, flexible working hours and trust in your productivity, all in sync with your team's general locations and time zones to foster effective and seamless collaboration. Our aim is to integrate your work with your lifestyle, ensuring a balance that respects both your needs and our operational requirements.


* **Regular in-person team events**: we bond over vibrant events that are as unique as our team, from local team and business unit gatherings, to new-joiner onboardings and company-wide events that bring us all together–literally.


* **Monthly full-day hacking sessions**: every month, we have Hack Fridays, where you can spend your time diving into a project you're passionate about and get the opportunity to work with other teams–we value your initiatives, impact, and creativity.


* **Comprehensive health insurance**: your health comes first. With our comprehensive insurance, we'll make sure you're covered from head to toe.


* **30 days of annual leave**: we value your peace of mind. With up to 30 days off (excluding public holidays) and access to mental health resources, we make sure you're as strong mentally as you are professionally.
* **Annual learning budget**: because we never stop learning, we’ve set up an annual budget for your professional development—pick a learning path which contributes to your career development and we'll back you up.

  


**If this role and our mission resonate with you, but you're hesitant because you don't check all the boxes, don't let that hold you back. At DeepL, it's about the value you bring and the growth we can foster together. Go ahead, apply—let's discover your potential together. We can't wait to meet you!**

***Would you like to use statistical physics to understand how gene regulation can be accurate?***

Job description


Early development and cell differentiation are often highly precise and stereotyped, which is crucial for healthy organism development. This precision requires that genes are carefully regulated; yet, gene regulation depends on the movement and binding of individual proteins, making it intrinsically stochastic or noisy. This project will address theoretically how gene regulation can be accurate despite this noise theoretically, and is part of a Vidi grant on this question.



We aim to use stochastic models and simulations combined with statistical physics and information theory to understand what “strategies” organisms use to achieve precision in processing protein signals. This project is theoretical, but includes close collaborations with experimentalists studying gene regulation in early mouse and fly development, as well as in synthetic systems. We will then compare the expected behaviour of these models to experimental observations from mouse and fly development, and hope, in final stages of the project, to make predictions for synthetic experiments.



Our theoretical biophysics group in Delft is embedded in the larger theory community at the Bionanoscience Department at TU Delft. The project will involve regular meetings with your advisor as well as regular meetings with the group, the broader community, and experimental collaborators. These interactions will help guide the PhD project, and your initiative is welcome to shape later stages of this project.


Requirements


The job requires a MSc in physics, mathematics, nano-biology or a related natural science discipline, with a strong interest in theory as well as biophysics.



We are looking for a motivated PhD candidate with the following expertise:


* You are passionate about (bio)physics, numerics, mathematics, and biology.
* You are fascinated by both the computational mathematical aspects and biology. Note that a pure synthetic biology background is not suitable for this position.
* You have affinity for combining numerical and analytical calculations.
* You have an interest in Statistical Physics.
* You possess some programming skills, for example in Python.
* You have a good command of the English language, both oral and written.


Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.

  


Conditions of employment


Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.



Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2770 per month in the first year to € 3539 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.



The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=ca149ec5860a0ed1,indeed,Postdoc: 'A business & financing perspective on NBS for transformative change',Universiteit Utrecht,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Universiteit-Utrecht,"Utrecht, UT, NL",,2024-07-22,,,,,False,,,h.s.toxopeus@uu.nl,"In this position, you will join the NATURESCAPES project, funded by Horizon Europe and led by Professor Harriet Bulkeley at Utrecht University, and work with colleagues at the Utrecht School of Economics (U.S.E.) and in the Copernicus Institute, alongside our partners in universities, NGOs and consultancies (e.g., TNC, WWF), as well as with local stakeholders and communities in case study cities worldwide.


**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


NATURESCAPES aims to address the pressing challenge of realising the transformative potential of nature-based solutions (NBS) for climate change, biodiversity loss and social justice. Despite progress in the field, our knowledge of the synergies and trade-offs from implementing NBS at scale across diverse and interconnected landscapes is limited. Also, challenges persist in designing effective and just governance arrangements, (co-)finance, and forms of citizen engagement because the value that NBS brings to diverse social actors is increasingly contested - bringing benefits to some and new forms of inequity and exclusion to others.


Advancing the transformative potential of NBS requires that we address these underlying challenges, ensuring that governance and finance arrangements are (1) effective and (2) just. NATURESCAPES will advance our understanding of how NBS across interconnected urban, rural and coastal landscapes generate benefits for diverse communities, particularly in areas of socio-economic disadvantage, inequity and risk. We will analyse the synergies/trade-offs emerging for climate, biodiversity and communities in 30 ‘naturescapes’ across Europe, LAC and the USA, including 12 in-depth case-studies focusing on the dynamics of implementation, and creating new insights and tools. In 7 of these cases we will co-design interventions with local collaborators that test transformative theories and practices of change and identify how these can be replicated.


As postdoctoral researcher, you will lead two main pieces of work within the NATURESCAPES project. Firstly, you will, using a business model perspective, build up a sound understanding regarding how actors that are currently missing and/or marginalized in NBS – ranging from insurance firms to vulnerable citizen groups – can capture and create value from NBS. This work will require several deliverables ranging from a database of actors, the development of strategic ‘value bundles’ for NBS and developing a game to engage specific actors. Secondly, you will lead the analytical work and deliverables on how co-finance and co-governance arrangements can support the transformative potential of NBS, through a cross-case analysis of the case studies that are carried out in the NATURESCAPES project. This will lead to an increased understanding of how to finance, govern and implement NBS in diverse socio-political contexts worldwide so that they lead to just and effective outcomes. For both strands of work, academic papers will be developed during the project alongside other project deliverables.


Working as a postdoctoral researcher in the interdisciplinary Utrecht University team across Economics and Copernicus, you will help to build our understanding of transformative change, focusing on questions of power, agency and systematic/structural change in relation to business models, governance and financing of nature-based solutions across landscapes. Working with other colleagues across our partner institutions, you will help to identify the key dynamics that support transformative change and develop guidance for future practice. You will also support our collaborative and transdisciplinary research process and activities aimed at engaging and communicating with policy-makers and decision-makers at local, regional, national and international levels.


This position also includes the option option to engage in education related to the research topic (e.g., teaching a sustainability-related course and/or thesis supervision) offered in the Utrecht School of Economics education programme during the course of the appointment.


**Wat breng je mee?**
---------------------

* have experience with collaborative ways of working, ability to work as part of a team and competence to liaise with academic, policy and representatives from the corporate sphere;
* are interested in, or have knowledge of, nature-based solutions (or natural capital, ecosystem services, blue-green infrastructure)

-------------------


Private, for-profit healthcare agencies are gaining power in contemporary health systems around the world. In the post-pandemic era and against the backdrop of fast rising workforce shortage levels, national governments increasingly welcome them for ‘quick and innovative solutions’ to pressing collective concerns and policy needs. Examples include the role of for-profit providers in addressing long waiting lists for hospital or nursing home care, health care deserts in more rural areas, and the development of digital infrastructures to enable technology-driven home care or self-employment of healthcare professionals. Even though private organizations have always been central to the Dutch healthcare system, now for-profit actors and internationally operating enterprises (‘private equity’) are moving in, introducing alternative ordering logics, valuation instruments and value regimes that are hardly understood in the healthcare context. This assetization of care may have far-reaching consequences for quality of care, working conditions and access to care. The PhD position focuses on this changing political economy of healthcare.


In this position, the PhD student will study the rather new phenomenon of assetization of care, in which health services are turned into assets to generate revenues for a wide range of actors. The focus will be on healthcare work and care provision. The PhD student will both empirically explore and theoretically conceptualize the assetization of care, using digital and ethnograph research methods. Case studies include the financial, technical and social infrastructures of care assetization, and will be selected together with the supervising team. The supervising team is a multidisciplinary team of sociological and economic scientists, as we aim to conduct transdisciplinary research to gain in-depth understanding of the current assetization movement.


**Project aims and objectives:**


This PhD position is part of a new and transdisciplinary research programme on Workforce and Sustainability in Health Care within ESHPM. The focus on assetization of care and the consequences for healthcare work and care delivery is one of the core research themes within this programme. In addition to developing PhD research, the PhD student will participate in broader research and teaching activitities to build and foster the Workforce and Sustainability Theme (e.g. participating in research seminars, developing panels for international conferences, developing courses for ESHPM students and post-academic training). Regarding the PhD project, the PhD student will be responsible for reviewing and synthesizing conceptual literature as well as designing an empirical study, collecting and analyzing qualitative data, and writing up research articles. The PhD project may include an international component as care assetization occurs across boarders.


**Supervising team**


Th primary supervisor will be Iris Wallenburg, professor in the Sociology of Care. Other members will be a researcher with expertise in critical sociology and a researcher with expertise in health economics. The PhD student will be part of a core team of two PhD candidates, two senior academics (Iris Wallenburg and Yiannis Kyratsis) who co-lead the Theme of Sustainable Healthcare and Workforce, and a broader academic community of scholars from various disciplines who are involved in research related to the Sustainable Healthcare and Workforce theme. This PhD student will be embedded in the department of Healthcare Governance, which is one of the seven departments in ESHPM and has a vibrant PhD community with regular research seminars

The textbook model postulates that plant receptors recognise pathogen-derived molecules and activate host immunity. However, there are indications that mechanical forces associated with pathogen invasion also contribute to immune activation. The big question is how plant cells detect these forces and translate them into an integrated immune response.


**Your job**
------------


The goal of this PhD project is to get insights into the molecular processes underlying mechanosensing of pathogens by plant cells. In this project, you will design and perform experiments that will provide a better understanding of how plants respond to mechanical force during infection. This requires a strong scientific basis in combination with your creativity and perseverance. The envisioned approaches aim to identify early signaling proteins and genes, to functionally analyse candidate genes by studying mutants and perturbed proteins, and to study infection phenotypes at the macroscopic, microscopic and biophysical level.


You will join the Translational Plant Biology (TPB) group at Utrecht University. The project fits well into the ongoing research of our group on plant immunity and signaling. Alternative ways of protecting plants against infectious diseases are desperately needed, and novel fundamental insights are crucial for this. Therefore, it is important to understand mechanosensing during infection and how this can be used to contribute to improving disease resistance.


This PhD project is part of the Gravitation programme GreenTE (Green Tissue Engineering), a multidisciplinary consortium of 7 Dutch universities. Together, GreenTE will unravel how plants sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. These fundamental insights will be the basis to develop engineering interventions to improve plant regeneration, seed longevity and defenses against disease. You will be an integral member of the GreenTE community, which offers an open, diverse and inspiring environment to engage in multidisciplinary mechanobiology research at the intersection of biology, chemistry and physics. Furthermore, you will have the opportunity to participate in GreenTE events, training and collaborations.


**Your qualities**
------------------


This project may be the right fit for you, if you are proactive, curiosity-driven, and bring a hands-on mentality. Next to that you have:


* a (nearly) completed MSc degree in Biology or Molecular Life Sciences;
* a strong background in at least two of the following areas: Plant Pathology/Immunity, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, Biophysics, or Genetics;
* interest in interdisciplinary research, connecting to modelling and biophysics and affinity with genetic approaches;
* demonstrable presentation and writing skills;
* communication skills that enable you to collaborate pleasantly and effectively in the team and consortium;
* working proficiency in English;


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer


* a position for four years;
* a gross monthly salary between €2,770 and €3,539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));

These data provide insights into transmission links between humans or animals, which are undetectable by epidemiological data. By integrating genetic, epidemiological and immunological data, we can study the processes shaping phylogenetic trees (Grenfell et al. 2004). This upcoming field, called phylodynamics, has proven useful in understanding outbreaks of, for instance, Covid-19. In PROVED, these models will enhance our knowledge of two viruses in swine.


**Your job**
------------


Phylodynamic studies can aid control of infectious diseases in animals, which is crucial to improve animal health and welfare and human health in case of zoonoses. However, phylodynamic models are not yet frequently applied to viruses in animal populations (Guinat et al. 2021), even though animal populations are interesting to study in light of contact structures that are incomparable to human populations.


We have a unique genomic dataset of two viruses in swine. Swine Influenza A virus (SIV) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSv) are significant causes of respiratory disease in swine and have been circulating in swine herds for decades, even though vaccines are available for both pathogens. Control of these viruses is hampered by extensive genetic diversity and continuous evolution by mutations, reassortment and recombination. By tracking the evolution of SIV and PRRSv within individual pigs, farms, and regions, and connecting this to vaccination status and epidemiological parameters, this project will provide novel means to decipher the transmission dynamics of the viruses in swine populations. The results of this research will contribute to the development and application of phylodynamic models in animal populations and to the control of respiratory viruses in swine herds. The findings will ultimately contribute to protecting animal and human health.


As PhD candidate in this project, you will use existing genomic data of SIV and PRRSv, movement data of pigs, and farm characteristics and locations, to model transmission of the viruses across countries, between farms, and within farms. Moreover, you will gather information about current vaccination practices applied by farmers, and evaluate the impact of vaccination protocols and other management factors on the evolution and dynamics of the viruses in farms. You will work in close partnership with Wageningen Bioveterinary Research for access to genomic data and expertise in virology, and with Royal GD for surveillance data from affected swine farms. Throughout the project, you will develop core skills in epidemiology and phylodynamics, and gain familiarity with virus genomics and animal infectious diseases.


**Your qualities**
------------------


This PhD project may be the right fit for you if:


* you hold an MSc degree from an internationally recognised institution in computational biology, bioinformatics, epidemiology, ecology or a related field;
* you are willing to learn new computational skills, and are interested in mechanisms of viral spread and evolution and animal infectious diseases;
* you have proficiency in English speaking and writing. Proficiency in Dutch is not necessarily required.


Proficiency in computer-based work is required, as well as the willingness to present research at international conferences. Experience working with sequence data and/or mathematical modeling would be an asset.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for one year, with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period;
* a working week of 36 to 40 hours and a gross monthly salary between €2,770 and €3,539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth.

You are willing to collaborate closely with both public and private partners on the development of crosslinked mycelium materials.

  


**Job description**  

This project is part of the FWO-SBO project MycoMatters (developing next-generation sustainable mycelium-based materials). The consortium partners in the MycoMatters project are Free University Brussels (VUB), Antwerp University, Ghent University and Maastricht University.

  


Driven by the urgently needed shift towards a more sustainable economy, there is a rising interest in mycelium materials, of which vegetative fungal biomass is a main component. Recently, focus is placed on materials with leather- and textile-like appearance for applications in fashion, apparel, interior design and automotive sectors. Despite the great promise and global investments, there are still challenges pertaining to the development of a material that meets performance criteria while being fully biobased and biodegradable and to developing a scalable cost-efficient production process. These challenges are addressed in the project, which aims to develop a robust process for production of 100% biobased and biodegradable mycelium-based materials with improved properties, such as mechanical strength and flexibility, durability but also visual and sensory attributes. The project aims to develop a higher-throughput small-scale fermentation platform, based on liquid-state surface fermentation, accelerating the research by enabling a screening of various feedstocks and process conditions, in direct connection to material characteristics. Key innovations include the use of biobased additives, such as crosslinkers, to enhance material properties and the integration of a bacterial synthetic biology host in a co-cultivation approach to optimize cost-efficiency of the process and quality of the product. Collaboration with users will guide initial product development and help to determine optimal applications, thereby further orienting the research. An interdisciplinary research approach will be employed, combining expertise in microbiology, synthetic biology, materials science, chemistry, engineering and product development. Project results will contribute to the future development of new value chains that provide environmentally conscious consumers with a fully biobased and biodegradable new material aligned with the circular economy principles.

  


The task of Maastricht University is to improve the material properties of mycelium such as mechanical strength and flexibility, durability but also visual and sensory attributes. Crosslinking with biobased and biodegradable materials will be explored and the crosslinking chemistry will use dynamic chemical bonds resulting in covalent adaptable networks that bring e.g. self-healing properties to mycelium.

  


This PhD project will result in a joint PhD between Maastricht University (UM, the Netherlands) and Free University Brussels (VUB, Belgium). The PhD student will be appointed at the Aachen-Maastricht Institute for Biobased Materials of Maastricht University, which is part of the Faculty of Science and Engineering. You will work in the Sustainable Polymer Synthesis group of Associate Professor Katrien Bernaerts, which focusses on the synthesis and design of polymer materials with tunable properties and recyclability exploiting the functionality of biobased building blocks. At VUB, you will work in the physical chemistry group of Prof. Niko Van den Brande. The chemical part of the work will be preformed at UM location Brightlands-Chemelot Campus in Geleen (Nl), while the physicochemical part of the work will be performed at VUB, Pleinlaan 2, Brussels (Be).

  


**Requirements**  

The PhD student:


* holds a MSc degree in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering or related fields;
* has skills in organic synthesis, polymer synthesis and chemical characterization;
* has interest in the material characterization of covalent adaptable networks (rheology, DMA, tensile test, …);
* has a strong interest to investigate structure-property relationships of the synthesized mycelium materials more specific from mechanical point of view;
* is open to scale up materials for application tests by companies of the advisory board;
* takes care of profound scientific publishing in peer review journals, if appropriate after patenting the work first;
* likes to interact with academic and industrial partners;

**Research group Sustainable Polymer Synthesis**  

Main research focus is on the design and synthesis of sustainable polymer materials with tuneable properties for the circular economy. Sustainability entails biobased building blocks (but no biorefinery) instead of fossil raw materials, green routes for polymer synthesis and processing, as well as chemical recycling/reprocessing methods (biodegradability, depolymerization, dynamic bonds) to make the end-of-life of polymers more sustainable. Structure-property relationships of the resulting polymers are evaluated in several fields of application e.g. stimuli-responsive polymers, coatings, fibres, engineering plastics and biomedical materials. Growing focus on the use of artificial intelligence techniques to support and accelerate the experimental work, e.g. data interpretation and prediction of structure-property relationships.

Join our research team and embark on a multidisciplinary PhD journey on experimental microfluidics with a high-impact application in health: molecular imaging and drug delivery with targeted microbubbles and ultrasound. We search for a highly motivated candidate with strong hands on and creative experimental skills.



In this project, you will work on the production and characterization of novel phospholipid-coated monodisperse microbubbles with a shell functionalized with antibodies that can bind to diseased tissue [1]. When these bubbles are driven by ultrasound, they’ll start to volumetrically oscillate and thereby generate a strong echo. Thus, antibody-functionalized microbubbles in combination with ultrasound imaging can be used for disease diagnosis. Additionally, the oscillating bubbles can create pores in the cell membrane and vascular wall such that they can also be used for drug delivery.



The ultrasound-driven bubble oscillations, and thus the bubble echo, have a strong dependency on many parameters including (i) the microbubble size, (ii) the binding characteristics, (iii) whether the bubble is bound or non-bound to a boundary or diseased cell, (iv) the viscoelastic properties of the stabilizing phospholipid shell, (v) the ultrasound driving frequency and acoustic pressure, and (vi) the properties of the surrounding medium including confinement. However, the physical dependence of the bubble oscillations on the huge parameter space remains elusive [2].



It will be your goal in this project to further our understanding of ultrasound-driven bubble oscillations of functionalized microbubbles and their interaction with surrounding boundaries and artificial tissues. You will be trained to use ultra-high-speed (fluorescence) microscopy imaging, confocal imaging, ultrasound imaging using a research ultrasound scanner, and cell culture in organ on-chip devices.



You will work in the dynamic and multidisciplinary BIOS/Lab on a Chip group, which is part of the Max Planck Center Twente for Complex Fluid Dynamics, the J.M. Burgers Research Center for Fluid Mechanics (JMBC), and the MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology. As such, you are surrounded by world-leading scientists on all aspects of the project, with whom you are encouraged to collaborate. You are also encouraged to follow additional training in relevant courses and training programmes, and to visit conferences and summer/winter schools on relevant topics. Your direct colleagues are friendly and active; they organize many after-work activities.

* teaching experience.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for 10 months (1.0 FTE);
* a gross monthly salary of €3,226 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale 10.0 under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));

**Faculteit/Dienst:** Faculteit der Natuurw., Wiskunde & Informatica
**Opleidingsniveau:** Master
**Functie type:** Promotieplaats
**Sluitingsdatum:** 15.08.2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13240
Are you wholeheartedly interested in the psychology of stress resilience, student mental health and exercise-based interventions? Are you a future researcher by heart, do you enjoy (learning about) statistical analyses of complex datasets, and is it your ambition to become a top-tier researcher? Then you might be the perfect candidate that we need for the project ‘Stress Tolerance and Resilience by Integrating Digital and Exercise training-based interventions for Mental Health of Dutch students’ (STRIDE)!  


**What are you going to do?**  

  

Every year, thousands of young adults in the Netherlands enrol at a university or university of applied sciences and often move to an urban environment. Exposure to multiple potential stressors during this new life phase is inevitable, including moving away from the parental home and environment, financial and academic challenges, and the challenge of forming a new social network. Chronic exposure to stress is a potent risk factor for the development of stress-related mood disorders, and many students are indeed at risk for developing anxiety and depression. Therefore, the central aim of the STRIDE project is to promote stress resilience in students. To this end, we will develop exercise interventions, as regular exercise is a low-cost behavioural strategy that is widely acknowledged to benefit mental health.  


In the first part of the project, you will adopt a complex systems approach to shed light on the complex interplay between physical activity/exercise training, depression, anxiety,  

stress, substance use, urbanicity, socioeconomic status, and relevant (personality/environmental/lifestyle) factors. To this end, you will analyse a large-scale data set for physical activity patterns in Dutch student populations to determine the relation with mental health. Furthermore, you will collaborate with local student sports centres to determine if active membership of a university sports centre is associated with better academic performance or mental health.  


Sequentially, you will develop a personalised, habit-based exercise training intervention for engendering long-lasting behaviour change and enduring beneficial effects on stress resilience and mental health. This exercise training intervention will initially be offered via the online Caring Universities platform to students at Amsterdam-based teaching institutes in collaboration with two Amsterdam-based student sports centres. Upon successful implementation, the exercise training intervention will be rolled out nationally to other Dutch student sports centres to help students with mental health problems on a national level.  


To achieve these ambitious aims, you will work together with the Caring Universities consortium and two Amsterdam-based student sports centres. You will be appointed within the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS) of the Faculty of Science, where dr. Joram Mul will be your daily supervisor, and you will collaborate closely with the other members of the STRIDE team (dr. Sanne de Wit, dr. Sascha Struijs and prof. Paul Lucassen). You will also become a member of the Centre for Urban Mental Health (UMH). UMH is the largest Research Priority Area of the University of Amsterdam, bringing together unique multidisciplinary research teams. UMH is embedded within three faculties of the University of Amsterdam and is unified by the emerging knowledge and skills available from the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, the Faculty of Medicine, and the Faculty of Science, together with the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS, UvA). This collaboration brings together unique multidisciplinary research teams and stakeholders from the Amsterdam region.  


You will take an active role in departmental activities, including attending and presenting at regular seminars. You will also spend one day per week (Wednesdays) at the Institute for Advanced Study and take part in discussions and presentations together with other interdisciplinary teams that are working on UMH projects that aim to promote urban mental health.  


**Tasks and responsibilities**  

  

You are expected to:  

* to complete a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four years;
* design and conduct research studies;
* perform (quantitative) data analyses;
* communicate about your research in presentations, at scientific conferences, and via academic publications in

**About us**  

  

The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences is one of the Faculty of Science’s largest institutes. Its approximately 240 scientists and staff members work in 19 research groups that perform excellent research centered on four themes: Neurosciences, Cell & Systems Biology, Microbiology and Green Life Sciences.  


You will be embedded in the Brain Plasticity group. The project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, the Faculty of Science (UvA-FNWI), the Department of Psychology, Faculty of Behavioral and Social Sciences (UvA-FMG) and the department of Clinical, Neuro- & Developmental Psychology of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU-FGB).  


The Centre for Urban Mental Health (UMH) is the largest interdisciplinary Research Priority Area of the University of Amsterdam. It aims to find new pathways to improve mental health in the city that consider the complexities and dynamics of mental health problems and mental health disorders in an urban environment. UMH is embedded within three faculties of the University of Amsterdam and is unified by the emerging knowledge and skills available from the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, the Faculty of Medicine, and the Faculty of Science, together with the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS, UvA). This collaboration brings together unique multidisciplinary research teams and stakeholders from the Amsterdam region.  


The general emphasis in the 2nd funding period (2024-2028) lies in developing and testing innovative interventions, aimed at different levels operating within an UMH context, i.e., from the individual to small social systems, such as family interventions up to urban level interventions on neighbourhoods, and up to a more global urban level, such as policy interventions. UMH is managed by three directors - prof. dr. Claudi Bockting, prof. dr. Reinout Wiers and dr. Harm Krugers - and is supported by a coordinator and an assistant. Most meetings for UMH are held on Wednesdays at the Institute for Advanced Study in the centre of Amsterdam.  


All UMH team members, thus PhD candidates, PostDocs as well as their supervisors, are expected to not only work on their own projects, but to also work on the UMH framework collaboratively, and are expected to prioritise time to participate in weekly UMH sessions at the IAS, such as PhD meetings, PI meetings and Lecture series. The UMH PhD candidate is thus expected to be an active member of the centre and the community associated with the centre.  


In the Caring Universities consortium, six universities (UvA, VU, Leiden, Utrecht, Maastricht, Erasmus) and three universities of applied sciences (Avans, Rotterdam, InHolland) work together to understand, prevent and effectively reduce psychological and psychosocial problems in students.

**Sluitingsdatum:** 16.08.2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13241  

Are you interested in how brain-wide networks contribute to cognition across the lifespan? And how events early in life may affect neuronal circuits and thereby behavior later in life? This project aims to better understand the neuronal mechanisms of how the cerebellum computes and adapts internal models to optimally behave in a dynamic and social environment.  


You will study this using a systems neuroscience approach, combining in vivo electrophysiology (Neuropixels) from cerebellum and forebrain areas with behavioral paradigms in rodents. Specifically, you will investigate neuronal circuits in the cerebellum and connected brain areas to various external factors, ranging from social touch to early cannabis exposure (a collaboration with Dr. Rixt van der Veen, Brain Plasticity Group).  


Behavior paradigms include social interactions between conspecifics, and tickling rodents to expose them to expected and unexpected social touch. You will then investigate how exposure to these external factors influence cognitive and motor skills later in life. In addition to performing behavioral experiments and implantation of silicon probes for recordings, analysis of behavior and of the electrophysiological recordings will be a substantial part of this project.  


This project is part of the Cellular and Circuit Neuroscience research line headed by Dr. Marlies Oostland. The research line is embedded in the Cellular and Computational Neuroscience Group at the Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences (SILS, Faculty of Science). The Cellular and Computational Neuroscience Group investigates functional and structural connectivity in the brain by using electrophysiology and imaging techniques to study how synaptic strength and network activity are changed from developmental stages to the aged brain. You will be supervised by Dr. Marlies Oostland and Prof. Helmut Kessels.

Job Description


*Incredible innovations are enabled through technology and science. We are seeking a passionate scientist to join our Technology Solutions Global R&D team as Principal Scientist. Join an incredible, passionate and diverse team that helps each other learn, grow and develop: just how we like it! As a Principal Scientist you will be asked to: 1) Provide strategic guidance, by driving, consulting on and executing modelling work on our various processes and products for global R&D and Operations. Such models will typically be based on an understanding of the underlying physics or chemistry (“white-box” modelling), but may need to use statistical approaches (“black-box” models) for some parts. You will be the principal scientist, so the methods and approaches for this are your own to choose. 2) Be JDE’s representative to the external scientific community; in which capacity you will maintain and grow links with research institutes, universities and professional bodies, to bring new capabilities and insights back into JDE. For this, we don’t just need you to be a knowledgeable professional but also strongly rely on your interpersonal skills as well as your drive for success. Know that you’ll have a crucial role in creating and protecting the impact we look for in our value chain. With this said, we like you to take responsibility over the following tasks:*

* ***Scientific and computer-modelling role***
	+ *Work in a range of projects as a scientist and computer modeler, where your unique expertise is needed to ensure efficient process, ingredient, pack and machine development. Also act as physical and/or chemical modelling consultant for R&D (and when applicable for Operations) and provide scientific sense-checking in the early phases of projects. As background: coffee itself and its associated processing covers a wide range of scientific disciplines, for example thermal & material diffusion & advection, phase changes such as crystallisation & sublimation, rheology, fluid flows, polymer & colloid science, physics of interfaces, foam stability/ripening, reaction kinetics, acid/base equilibria, granular flows, fracture, and so forth. The Principal Scientist will need familiarity with as many of these areas as possible, to provide input & guidance on project content.*
* ***Mentoring role***
	+ *You will not have direct line management duties, so effectiveness requires guiding other associates and teams in their scientific experiments, data analysis and in developing their own models. In that sense the relationship to other associates may have something of the quality of a “master and apprentices”. Guidance and mentoring extends to interns, PhD and EngD students.*
* ***Internal role-model and external ambassador***
	+ *Champion and exemplify scientific rigour & discipline within R&D. Be a peer reviewer for internal technical reports. Coordinate internal knowledge-sharing sessions, and own & manage the external publication clearance process.*
	+ *Represent JDE in the scientific and professional community at large. This may include acting as board member for the global association for science and information on coffee (“ASIC”), and other professional bodies or academic boards as appropriate to the role.*


Qualifications


*We are looking for a scientist with broad experience across disciplines, the ability to link scientific questions to key business priorities, and with a drive for excellence. Someone that holds themselves accountable and doesn’t shy away from responsibility. Given the nature of the role we feel it's important for you to have a certain level of qualifications (masters or PhD in physics or chemistry), experience as a research scientist (10 years), and a proven track record of delivery in (preferably) a fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company (7 years in R&D and/or operations); as well as a solid understanding of your own added value. We thrive in diverse teams and look for people that appreciate that as much as we do. We can give you a list of “must haves,” however that’s not how we view your candidacy. We do, of course, take into consideration how much experience you have with summarizing complex information to communicate to stakeholders and experience in interacting with research institutes and mentoring/coaching associates; but ultimately, we look at the bigger picture. But to give you a bit of guidance as to what we feel is needed in this role, we’ll share our “important to have” list with you:*

* ***Autonomous and self-motivated***
* ***Cooperative, with a supportive attitude to co-workers***
* ***Ability to find and communicate simplicity in complex situations***
* ***Desire to mentor and develop others***

Schuberg Philis continues to expand its focus on data for a growing number of customers which means that we are looking for Data Engineers.



We keep our customers moving forward by designing, building and running their data landscapes. These landscapes are often developed in public cloud environments, but there is diversity in implementation: not all customers are the same. We have data lake environments on our own hybrid cloud (sbp.cloud), AWS, Azure and more.


**As an AWS Data Engineer you will:**


* Develop and maintain data pipelines
* Configure and manage tools like Spark, Glue, Kinesis, S3, Lambda, Kafka, Redshift, Athena, EventHub, etc.
* Support tooling such as Gitlab (CI/CD), Terraform (Infra)
* Focus on the technical implementation of use cases and required tools on a new data platform
* Be involved in the data standards and initiatives that we have set for our customers


On a team level, you will be involved in the data strategy of the customer by developing a data platform that will be used to develop various use cases for the users of data. You get to actively explore, design, build and run data lakes in AWS. Your work will be completely customer-focused but you will also contribute to expanding and maturing the Schuberg Philis data landscape architecture and all of its initiatives.


**Who are we looking for?**



In this role, you will thrive if you have the following experience:


* Building data pipelines in a cloud-native manner (e.g. S3, Lambda's, Glue, etc )
* Used to working with large data sets in both data lakes (S3) & data warehouses (Redshift)
* Good AWS knowledge, especially all the data related services
* Python & data library ecosystem
* Spark + Spark Streaming (Java/Scala or PySpark)


Nice to have:


* Software development, particularly API's (Python)
* Kafka & Kafka Connect
* Terraform
* Docker
* Proficiency in Dutch
* AWS Data Analytics Certifications


If you are a strong team player who recognizes yourself in the above, likes to take ownership, can work independently as part of a team, and can challenge us on our decisions: we'd like to hear from you.

 *Everyone we work with and consider working with has a right to equal treatment. The hiring and appraisal process at Schuberg Philis is designed to be thorough and equitable, implementing fair payment, benefits, and opportunities across all demographics.*  

  

*It is our desire to be a company that brings together multiple nationalities, cultures, religions, genders, abilities, and talents within and across our teams.

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.

En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.  

  

Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?  

  

Naast een afgeronde Bachelor of Master en enkele jaren werkervaring zijn dit de specifieke skills die we zoeken:

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

=====================

* **We are on a mission** to make programming biology easy. We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.
* We're an **experienced team**. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!
* We're focused on building the **best possible team culture**. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.
* We offer **top of the market** salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.


**Responsibilities**:


As a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:

* Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools
* Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations
* Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process
* Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain
* Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.
* Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem

**Need to haves**
=================

* Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills
* You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.
* You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer\*, or even implement a UI plugin.
* You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.
* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**
=================

* Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.
* A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.
* You have worked with databases or big data systems.
* You have designed user interfaces and are familiar with one or more of the popular frameworks.
* You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.
* Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Cradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.**  

  

We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.


You will be joining a high-growth, highly ambitious startup with an experienced founding team, whose motivation is building a more sustainable world using biology. We are backed by some of the most well known investors and industry veterans. Joining us now means you will be getting in on the ground floor; you will have a significant impact on how we shape the company, and success will mean an outsized reward.

**You and your job**

Rabobank finances farmers and food supply chain clients around the world. Farming impacts biodiversity, both positively and negatively. How can we quantify the financed impact on nature?

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development

Your days will be filled with exciting challenges and opportunities to make a real impact:* You'll assist in the development and periodic review of the bank’s risk appetite statements and tolerance levels.

An exciting position within an international yet personal university. You are right in the middle of the students, on a green campus within walking distance of the central station. Besides beautiful architecture, you will find varied workplaces and excellent sports facilities. We also offer you:


* The position comes with the chance to learn and grow in your role and cooperate with other talented people who challenge you every day;

Stel de juiste prioriteiten. Vertaal beleid naar de praktijk. En draag bij aan de informatievoorziening rond 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken per jaar.



Wat doe je als Informatiemanager bij IVO Rechtspraak?



Jouw werk is van grote invloed op de rechtspraak. En daarmee op het leven van mensen. Want de rechtspraak kan niet zonder goede informatie. En die moet voor álle betrokkenen eenvoudig beschikbaar zijn. Van rechters tot burgers die door een geschil of misdaad in een rechtszaak zijn verwikkeld. Jij speelt een centrale rol in die informatievoorziening. Een opdracht op niveau, waarbij de prioriteiten die jij stelt of laat stellen het verschil maken!



Hoe je werk eruitziet



Ieder jaar zijn er zo’n 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken in Nederland. Binnen IVO Rechtspraak hebben we verschillende teams die zich bezighouden met informatievoorziening. In elk team stuurt een portefeuillehouder namens de business met een rechtsgebied als focus: straf, civiel en bestuur, toezicht, familie en jeugd, data en registers, en tot slot bedrijfsvoering. Jij bent de rechterhand van de portefeuillehouder en start bij het IV-team Bedrijfsvoering. De portefeuille Bedrijfsvoering levert generieke diensten aan Rechtspraak-collega's en externe partijen, zoals burgers, rechtzoekenden, journalisten en ketenpartners. De portefeuille is onderverdeeld in de volgende 5 thema's waarbinnen alle verschillende applicaties van Bedrijfsvoering zijn ondergebracht; klantgerichte communicatie en kennisportalen, slim samenwerken en online zitten, creëren en delen van uitspraken, facilitering bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen en digitale informatiehuishouding.



Samen met je collega-informatiemanagers breng jij in kaart welke informatie nodig is om rechtszaken en bedrijfsondersteunende processen optimaal te laten verlopen. Daar maak je voor jouw thema beleid op, ook voor de lange termijn. En je ziet toe op de uitvoering van dat beleid. Zo bouw je mee aan de digitale toekomst van de rechtspraak in ons land.



Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware 2 talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.



Zit je als informatiemanager graag dicht bij het vuur? En wil je de richting van de rechtspraak mee helpen bepalen? Stuur dan direct je sollicitatie!

 **Vacature**

**Communicatiemedewerker GGD** **(24 uur)**

 **Hoe ziet jouw toekomstige werkdag eruit?**  

Je start de werkdag goed met een lekkere kop koffie. Samen met je collega’s praat je bij over het weekend. Maar niet te lang, want aan het begin van de ochtend heb je meteen de weekstart van de GGD. Samen met je communicatiecollega’s bespreek je welke gezondheidsonderwerpen je de komende periode uitlicht. Dit doe je aan de hand van de omgevingsscan waarop je aanhaakt bij de behoefte van de inwoners, de contentplanning en ons jaarplan.


Hierna ga je gelijk aan de slag met het maken van content. De nieuwe social mediacampagne moet namelijk vandaag worden ingepland. Jij weet als geen ander hoe je met creatieve content de doelgroep kan bereiken. Naast je eigen kennis en ervaring, gebruik je hierbij de data en resultaten van eerdere, gelijksoortige campagnes.


De tijd vliegt en voor je het weet is het lunchtijd. Je loopt een rondje met je collega’s om even de benen te strekken. Als je terugkomt start een online meeting met een projectleider over een nieuwe voorlichtingscampagne. Je stelt vragen over doel, doelgroep en adviseert vervolgens over middelen.


Na de meeting neem je de tijd om je mail bij te werken. Je ontving een vraag van een journalist. Samen met de inhoudsdeskundige die de woordvoering doet, formuleer je de antwoorden op de vragen. Later deze week begeleid je het persmoment. Het laatste uur voer je een maandelijkse analyse uit om het gebruikersgedrag op de websites in beeld te brengen. Dit geeft weer nieuwe inzichten om de website te optimaliseren. Voldaan klap je je laptop dicht en verheug je je op morgen. Want morgen is weer een nieuwe dag die totaal anders kan zijn!

**Wat ga je doen?**  

Binnen onze veiligheidsregio hebben we de unieke combinatie van gezondheid (GGD) én veiligheid (Brandweer, Crisisbeheersing). Als communicatiemedewerker richt jij je op operationele taken van de GGD. Jouw werkgebied is breed en omvat afgebakende, uitvoerende werkzaamheden waarbij je nauw samenwerkt en spart met je communicatiecollega's.


Daarnaast zijn we een crisisorganisatie, wat betekent dat je ook bereid bent deel te nemen aan een communicatiepiket tijdens crisissituaties. Gemiddeld ben je 8 tot 10 keer per jaar een week lang bereikbaar en beschikbaar voor communicatieve werkzaamheden tijdens crisissituaties. Dit doe je samen met andere collega's die piket hebben die week.

**Jouw taken:**

* Content creatie: realiseren van boeiend en inspirerende content voor onze online en offline kanalen.
* Verhalen vertellen: complexe info omzetten in begrijpelijke en pakkende verhalen die onze doelgroep raken en betrekken.
* Social media: beheren van social media kanalen, toffe posts maken en interactie aangaan met onze volgers.
* Content organiseren: campagnes plannen en coördineren die ons merk en werk in de spotlight zetten.
* Huisstijl bewaken: bewaken en versterken van onze huisstijl in alle communicatie-uitingen
* Media contacten: opbouwen en onderhouden van relaties met de media, en zorgen voor positieve publiciteit en zichtbaarheid.
* Data checken: communicatiekanalen en communicatiecampagnes analyseren en data gebruiken om onze strategieën te verbeteren.
* Samenwerken: met verschillende teams en vormgever om communicatieprojecten van start tot finish te brengen.

**Wat breng je mee?**

* Diploma in communicatie of een vergelijkbare studie.
* Ervaring met traditionele en moderne communicatiemiddelen en campagnes.
* Top skills voor het maken pakkende teksten en beelden waarmee je onze doelgroep raakt.
* Sterk in vormgeving en bekend met tools, zoals Canva.
* Creatief brein met scherp oog voor detail.
* Sterke verbale en schriftelijke communicatie.
* Zelfstarter met een proactieve mindset.
* Analytisch vermogen om social media en websitedata om te zetten in slimme(re) communicatie.
* Echte teamplayer die graag samenwerkt.
* Passie voor verhalen vertellen en het bouwen van een sterk merk.
* Coachende vaardigheden en het vermogen om collega's te begeleiden en afdelingen te ondersteunen bij hun communicatie.

**Jouw team:**  

Je werkt in een leuk en enthousiast communicatieteam met 12 collega’s. Een team dat grotendeels bestaat uit jonge professionals, maar ook met enkele collega’s die al langer in het vak zitten. We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**  

Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA. Je komt te werken in een crisisorganisatie vol afwisseling. De coronacrisis, vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne, het hoogwater van de Maas of een grote brand. Wij waren erbij betrokken. Als communicatiemedewerker zit je bij ons nooit stil.


Je kunt je eigen werktijden en werkplek bepalen. Wij werken vanuit vertrouwen waarbij vrijheden en verantwoordelijkheden hand in hand gaan. Er zijn dus volop mogelijkheden om je privé- en werksituatie met elkaar te combineren.

Van leidinggeven aan je collega’s tot het ontwikkelen van een visie voor onze unit: in deze veelzijdige rol zorg jij voor een soepele informatieverstrekking aan onze partners.

Waarom goede Informatieverstrekking vanuit de RDW belangrijk is? De data waarover de RDW beschikt speelt elke dag een grote en belangrijke rol in de maatschappij: in de rechtszekerheid van mensen, in duurzaamheid, en vooral in de veiligheid van ons allemaal.

“Hoe mooi is het dat we overheidsorganisaties helpen hun taken goed uit te voeren? Zo dragen we bij aan een leefbaar en verkeersveilig Nederland.

Werken aan de mobiliteit van morgen  
Van de politie die informatie opvraagt over een kenteken tot een journalist die onderzoeksvragen heeft over kentekens en rijbewijzen in Nederland: als unitmanager zorg jij dat alle externe partijen op tijd de juiste informatie krijgen. Je geeft leiding aan collega’s en zet hen in hun kracht, ontwikkelt strategische plannen en realiseert afspraken en doelen volgens het managementcontract. Je zorgt ook dat we de wet- en regelgeving naleven, bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van privacy en verbetert onze rol als nationaal contactpunt voor internationale gegevensuitwisseling.

Daarnaast ben je teamlid van het managementteam van de afdeling, met wie je het beleid ontwikkelt en afstemt. We zijn volop bezig met de doorontwikkeling van onze afdeling. Jij helpt ons de volgende stap te zetten: je kijkt hoe we onze dienstverlening beter kunnen structureren en professionaliseren, bijvoorbeeld met de inzet van data-intelligence. Je houdt externe ontwikkelingen in de gaten, vertaalt deze naar onze afdeling en je unit en zet kansen voor innovatie om in projecten. Daarvoor werk je nauw samen met ICT-serviceteams om te zorgen dat de oplossingen onze doelen ondersteunen. Ook ben je opdrachtgever van stuurgroepen bij multidisciplinaire projecten.

Dit is jouw thuisbasis  
Jouw unit Informatieverstrekking bestaat uit zo'n 32 collega’s en je geeft direct leiding aan de teammanagers, unitadviseurs en onder andere de medewerkers die zich bezighouden met privacy en security. We vormen een hechte club: we zijn betrokken, staan altijd voor elkaar klaar en hebben oog voor wie jij bent, als collega én als mens. Ook organiseren we leuke teamuitjes om onze band te versterken. Door je centrale rol in onze organisatie ben je vaak op kantoor te vinden, maar thuiswerken kan ook: jij voelt goed aan wanneer dat kan!

Je vertaalt data naar concrete inzichten waarmee de redactie nog meer impact kan maken, duikt in de cijfers om trends te duiden en geeft journalisten advies hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter op de bezoeker afstemmen.  

  

**FUNCTIEOMSCHRIJVING**  

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van de PZC in Middelburg. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data. Dat betekent dat je met cijfers bezig bent, maar ook veel met redactieleden overlegt en ze traint in hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter online presenteren. Je analyseert, rapporteert en geeft dus advies.


Je gaat op zoek naar antwoorden op vragen als: Waarom haken mensen af in een artikel? Wat is de ideale mix aan verhalen? Wat is de optimale spreiding van artikelen over de dag? En waarom stijgt of zakt het bezoek de afgelopen weken?


De adviezen geef je op drie ‘snelheden’: live, in dag- en weekrapporten en in grotere analyses. Op de dag zelf kijk je met een schuin oog mee naar de cijfers en deel je belangrijke actiegerichte inzichten met de redactie. In dag- en weekrapporten geef je duiding aan de cijfers. Naast de dagelijkse taken voer je ook regelmatig diepgravende analyses uit.



Je bent een belangrijke sparringpartner voor de chefs en hoofdredactie bij de PZC en werkt nauw met hen samen.

Naast redactie-analisten zijn er diverse centrale rollen in het team die jou bij je werk zullen ondersteunen.  

  

**FUNCTIEPROFIEL**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.


**VOORWAARDEN**


* salaris, passend bij jouw ervaring;
* 38-urige werkweek, minder uur in overleg;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;
* ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden d.m.v. opleidingen en trainingen;
* We geloven in een gezonde werk-privébalans waarbij je voldoende ruimte krijgt voor jouw welzijn en flexibel werken.

**Wat doe je als Informatiemanager bij IVO Rechtspraak?**
---------------------------------------------------------


Jouw werk is van grote invloed op de rechtspraak. En daarmee op het leven van mensen. Want de rechtspraak kan niet zonder goede informatie. En die moet voor álle betrokkenen eenvoudig beschikbaar zijn. Van rechters tot burgers die door een geschil of misdaad in een rechtszaak zijn verwikkeld. Jij speelt een centrale rol in die informatievoorziening. Een opdracht op niveau, waarbij de prioriteiten die jij stelt of laat stellen het verschil maken!


### **Hoe je werk eruitziet**


Ieder jaar zijn er zo’n 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken in Nederland. Binnen IVO Rechtspraak hebben we verschillende teams die zich bezighouden met informatievoorziening. In elk team stuurt een portefeuillehouder namens de business, met een rechtsgebied als focus: straf, civiel en bestuur, toezicht, familie en jeugd, Data en Registers en tot slot bedrijfsvoering. Jij bent de rechterhand van de portefeuillehouder en start bij het IV-team Bedrijfsvoering. De portefeuille Bedrijfsvoering levert generieke diensten aan Rechtspraak collega's en externe partijen, zoals burgers, rechtzoekenden, journalisten en ketenpartners. De portefeuille is onderverdeeld in de volgende vijf thema's waarbinnen alle verschillende applicaties van Bedrijfsvoering zijn ondergebracht; klantgerichte communicatie en kennisportalen, slim samenwerken en online zitten, creëren en delen van uitspraken, facilitering bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen en digitale informatiehuishouding


Samen met je collega-informatiemanagers breng jij in kaart welke informatie nodig is om rechtszaken en bedrijfsondersteunende processen optimaal te laten verlopen. Daar maak je voor jouw thema beleid op, ook voor de lange termijn. En je ziet toe op de uitvoering van dat beleid. Zo bouw je mee aan de digitale toekomst van de rechtspraak in ons land.


Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware twee talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.

By breaking down borders and bringing on a wide variety of clients and positions we try to make sure there’s a position and dream destination for everyone.

Furthermore, we are a big multinational team, living and working in many different countries, but working closely both in and between teams!

Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.  

  

**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.

* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
