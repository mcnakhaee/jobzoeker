For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to preempt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

From our people who are caring, candid, and impact-driven to our business, which is innovative and rooted in science, we believe that being proudly unique, determined to be our best, and authentic is essential to fulfilling our purpose.
The role
Join our dynamic bioinformatics team at Genmab as a student data engineer, where you will play a crucial role in supporting our scientists by creating and managing sophisticated data architectures aligned with FAIR principles.

Your work will support essential projects aimed at enhancing drug discovery and development processes, fostering your growth as a data scientist and making a meaningful impact in the field of biomedicine.*Project Background*
Translational research leverages real-world data sets to study how patients respond to cancer treatments. This research often involves integrating complex and non-standardized molecular and clinical data. Clinical datasets, designed to answer specific scientific questions, typically lack detailed data granularity, making exploration challenging. Understanding the clinical data model is crucial to selecting the appropriate variables for analysis.
This project proposes the use of graph databases to overcome these challenges by organizing data into a flexible, multidimensional structure that facilitates easier access and more intuitive querying. Graph databases, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, allow for the discovery of implicit relationships within the data that traditional table-based databases might miss. Through this initiative, we aim to develop and evaluate AI-driven querying techniques using natural language, enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets in translational research.
Responsibilities* Technology Exploration: Investigate various graph database technologies and their applicability to managing clinical data, assessing their strengths and limitations in this domain.
* Data Model Comparison: Compare and analyze the data structures of graph and relational databases to identify the most effective frameworks for clinical data.
* Pilot Database Development: Design and implement a prototype database focused on the standardization of clinical real-world data, ensuring it supports robust data integration and access.
* Natural Language Query Development: Create methods to enable querying of graph databases using natural language, employing advanced AI technologies to facilitate intuitive data interactions.
* Findings Presentation: Regularly present progress and insights during team meetings, ensuring clear communication of developments and challenges.
* Bonus Objective: Develop a user interface that enables easy querying, and effective visualization and presentation of results from the database.


Requirements* Education: You are a BSc/MSc student in bioinformatics, computational biology or a related field.
* Technical skills: Demonstrated strong technical skills, with substantial experience in Python programming. Familiarity with AWS is an added advantage.
* Soft skills: Comfortable with pioneering research and creative processes; scientific thinking and connecting that to technical requirements.


About You* You are passionate about our purpose and genuinely care about our mission to transform the lives of patients through innovative cancer treatment
* You bring rigor and excellence to all that you do. You are a fierce believer in our rooted-in-science approach to problem-solving
* You are a generous collaborator who can work in teams with diverse backgrounds
* You are determined to do and be your best and take pride in enabling the best work of others on the team
* You are not afraid to grapple with the unknown and be innovative
* You have experience working in a fast-growing, dynamic company (or a strong desire to)

**That’s why we love them!**

  


Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

  

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.


Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

  

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  

Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.



In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

  

**The role in 6 bullets**

  

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

 **Your track record mentions**

  

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

  


**Why join Orbisk?**



For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

  

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

With its roughly 30 branches, 7,600 employees (6,700 fte) and 13,100 students and over 150,000 participants to WUR’s Life Long Learning, Wageningen University & Research is one of the leading organisations in its domain. The unique Wageningen approach lies in its integrated approach to issues and the collaboration between different disciplines.  

  

Read the 5 reasons why your future colleagues enjoy working at WUR and watch the video below to get an idea of our green campus!

**Omschrijving**
----------------


The Soil Physics and Land Management chair group at Wageningen University and Research is seeking a postdoc researcher in hydrological modelling who will be responsible for the numerical modelling work in project RESTARTIN: “Restructuring and enhancing strategies with a transformative approach for integrated water disaster management in India and the Netherlands”. This work will involve not only the modelling itself, but also the use of high-resolution satellite imagery to assess vegetation water conditions for calibration, the design of land-use change scenarios (eventually with modelling), and interactions with stakeholders and socioeconomic researchers to translate potential adaptation options into practice.  

Your duties and responsibilities include:

+ apply a surface and groundwater model to several regions in the Netherlands (Limburg, Brabant and Holland);
+ assess climate change scenarios and design compatible land-use scenarios;
+ assess the impact of climate change on flood and drought conditions;
+ test potential adaptation options in coordination with stakeholders;
+ some involvement in related educational activities is possible.
**You will work here**  

You will work in project RESTARTIN, jointly funded by NWO and DST-India. Most of the work will be developed within the Soil Physics and Land Management chair group in WUR. But it will be closely coordinated with researchers at IHE-Delft working on detailed risk assessment and socioeconomic analysis. It will also be closely linked with similar activities being performed by Indian researchers in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra. Some travelling to India is therefore expected.


The intended starting date of this position is 1 September 2024.

**Functie-eisen**
-----------------


You hold a PhD degree in hydro(geo)logy, environmental sciences or equivalent. You also possess:

+ strong and broad conceptual and methodological knowledge of hydrology at the soil-water-plant and watershed scales, including relevant numerical models (e.g., HEC-HMS/RAS, SWMM, HBV, SWAT, SHE, VIC, MODFLOW, CATHY, HGS, FEFLOW, DSSAT, etc.), and model calibration/validation techniques;
+ in-depth experience with GIS packages (e.g., ArcGIS, Qgis) and advanced data analysis techniques;
+ in-depth experience with scripting in R, MATLAB, Python, FORTRAN, etc.;
+ experience in scientific writing, conducting research, and a publication record in hydrology;
+ ability to work independently and to take ownership of the assigned tasks, including making independent decisions on implementation details.

In our international working environment, there is an increasing amount of communication in English. For this position it is about level C1.


You can see that there are plenty of challenges ahead of you. These challenges can also be seen as development opportunities. So, if you do not yet have the track-record required in the vacancy, but do have solid work experience, we would also like to invite you to apply.

**Arbeidsvoorwaarden**
----------------------


Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:

+ sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
+ working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;

+ there is a strong focus on vitality, and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
+ a fixed December bonus of 8.3%;
+ excellent pension scheme.

In addition to these first-rate employee benefits, you will of course receive a good salary. Depending on your experience, we offer a competitive gross salary of between € 3.226 and € 5.090 for a full-time working week of 38 hours, in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreements for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU) (scale 10 ). Initially, we offer you a one-year contract, which will then be extended until the end of the project if there is mutual enthusiasm. Of course, we would be happy to discuss this with you if you have any questions.


Wageningen University & Research encourages internal advancement opportunities and mobility with an internal recruitment policy. There are plenty of options for personal initiative in a learning environment, and we provide excellent training opportunities. We are offering a unique position in an international environment with a pleasant and open working atmosphere.

**Coming from abroad**  

Wageningen University & Research is the university and research centre for life sciences. The themes we deal with are relevant to everyone around the world and Wageningen, therefore, has a large international community and a lot to offer to international employees.

Wageningen University & Research’s International Community page contains practical information about what we can do to support international employees and students coming to Wageningen.

-------------------


  
Are you an ambitious bioinformatician with a solid background in omics data analysis and experience in the field of immunology and/or infectious disease research? Then this bioinformatician position is the job for you!



Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”



Unique to this job  

We are an international, dynamic, highly motivated team of scientists at different stages of our careers with a strong drive to push research for the benefit of Public Health.

We know what it takes to lead UPS into tomorrow, – people with a unique combination of skills and passion. If you have the qualities and drive to lead yourself then this role will help you to cultivate your skills and take you to the next level. As a part of the internship, you will have opportunity to learn and develop the following business cases:

**Document Indexing (DOCIDX)**


Indexing scanned documents based on an embedded barcode of any type like CODE39, QR... is essential for any later processing, such as storage and retrieval, distribution to other departments or customer, and other back-office processing. We would like you to work on creating a reusable interface to index scanned documents in bulk, easily customizable for any environment and task.

**Package Type Detection (PKGDCT)**


UPS operates a large number of automated package-processing facilities. Not all packages processed have the perfect cube shape and size. We need to detect the shape of the packages (e.g., envelope, regular box, big size, irregular…) so that they are processed with the care required for each type, or even detect warning conditions like broken packages or liquid leaks.

**Job Description:**


As a computer vision scientist, you will review the current process flow the cases for image acquisition, either paper-based or digital documents for the case #1 and explore different options to capture package images from operational facilities to be later processed in case #2. For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to pre-empt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

Put simply: we could write history together.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-------------------


Join us – we look forward to welcoming you to our Self-Organizing Soft Matter Research Group at Eindhoven University of Technology!


We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Researcher with a passion for quantitative microscopy and physical chemistry of self-assembling materials to join our team to image the behavior of ice-interactive biomaterials on ice with single-molecule resolution. The goal of your project is to develop and use state-of-the-art microscopy tools and quantitative image analysis approaches to discover the physical principles underpinning the activity of novel ice-interactive biomaterials and to tune their interaction with ice to modulate activity as desired.


Key Responsibilities:


* Conduct high-quality, curiosity-driven, original, and independent research focusing on quantitative imaging and super-resolution microscopy of self-assembling materials
* Collaborate with a multi-disciplinary and international team of researchers
* Present research findings at conferences and publish in top-tier scientific journals
* Mentor and support junior researchers in the lab


The formation and growth of ice during freezing, storage, and/or thawing of cryopreserved materials limits the potential of cryopreservation technology for the long-term storage of sensitive materials, such as cells, tissues, and organs. Our group aims to unravel how biological and engineered ice-interactive materials function so that we can create customized chemical cryoprotectants for biomedical and other applications. Recently, we reported sub-zero super-resolution microscopy experiments which allowed us to study for the first time the interfacial dynamics of ice-bound ice-binding proteins at the single molecule level (see PNAS publication for more information). In this project you will build upon these pioneering experiments. You will image the interaction with ice of a novel class of engineered ice-interactive materials at the single molecule level to advance our understanding of how their structure and properties impact their ability to modulate ice crystal formation and growth. In this exciting role, you will work in a vibrant and international research group aiming to advance molecular insight into the working mechanism of novel ice-interactive materials for biomedical applications.

Are you an ambitious bioinformatician with a solid background in omics data analysis and experience in the field of immunology and/or infectious disease research? Then this bioinformatician position is the job for you!



Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens.

We are looking for a researcher carrying out part of a project on the socio-ecological impact of postgrowth housing scenarios. The overall project is intended to study the relation between income, housing tenure and ecological footprint, as well as to build possible scenarios of a socially just and ecologically sustainable housing system. The aim is to demonstrate differences in environmental impact that different existing and future housing models have. We will start with The Netherlands and them work at EU-level.  


The project includes two different sub-studies:
* ***A postgrowth assessment of dominant housing systems***: this study will deploy LCA-based urban metabolism models to assess the long-term performance of the existing housing stock. It will focus on the income-to-environmental impact of existing housing to show the relation between income, housing type and carbon, material and land use footprint.
* ***Scenarios for postgrowth housing systems***: this study will assess the projected environmental impact of prototypes of postgrowth housing. The team will develop models that combine different measures and elaborate on possible scenarios. These prototypes are defined from the literature and from a preliminary analysis of existing real-life examples. They include eco-communities, urban housing cooperatives and large-scale social housing.
  


The researcher will work with an interdisciplinary team formed by Dr. Federico Savini (spatial planning, Principal Investigator) and Dr. Cody Hochstenbach (human geography, housing studies) at the University of Amsterdam, Mira Kopp (urban industrial ecology, Mercator Research Institute, TU Berlin) and Dr. Stefano Merciai (industrial ecology, University of Leiden, Aarus University).  

This team is embedded in the broader research program of the ERC-funded research project ‘DECYCLE’.  

**What are you going to do**  


The research assistant will help the team in developing models for the environmental impact assessment of housing in the two studies. The tasks include:  


Research tasks:
* building a model to study the environmental footprint of large-scale housing systems. Variables include income, housing tenure, housing type, energy use, energy sources, construction materials, urbanicity, transport use;
* generate environmental impact factors for future energy and material use over several decades using prospective LCA applications such as premise;
* gathering data from existing GIS, energy and material databases such as Basisregistratie Adressen en Gebouwen (BAG), 3DBAG, EUBUCCO, DEGO VNG Energietransitie Gebouwde Omgeving, TABULA, ecoinvent.

  


**What do you have to offer**  


The candidate should be specialized in the following:
* data analysis using python and pandas;
* interest in the built environment.

  


Required skills:
* Completed or ongoing master’s in industrial ecology, data science, quantitative geography, or related fields.

  


Desirable skills:
* familiarity with key terminology and procedures of life cycle assessment, potentially also first contact with prospective LCA applications.
* geospatial analysis and calculating metrics with geographic information systems.
* familiarity with degrowth or postgrowth debates in economics or environmental studies.

  


**What can we offer you**  


The position concerns a temporary employment of 1 day a week, 7.6 hours per day for a maximum term of one year. For this position the University Job Classification profile research assistant applies.  

Your salary will be €2.846 to € 2.920 gross per month, based on full-time employment and in keeping with the Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities. We additionally offer an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-----------------


Are you interested in wellbeing research and do you have a background in behaviour genetics and/or molecular genetic/multi-omics methodology? Then we are looking for you!


**Project description**  

In light of major demographic trends, building and maintaining health and wellbeing amongst citizens is one of the most important societal challenges countries face. People who feel well, function better, are less susceptible to mental illness, and thus are better able to retain competitive advantage and expand human capital. People who feel well also facilitate social capital by enjoying stronger and more-lasting relationships.


Knowledge on the malleability of wellbeing is essential to facilitate and build wellbeing. While converging evidence reports significant positive effects of wellbeing training, the effects have so far only been studied in single omics designs.


In this project, we, as a team, will go beyond the state of the art by setting up a (gamified) wellbeing training in a multi-omics informative sample, including (epi) genetic, metabolome, and environmental (exposome) data. We will extend traditional randomized control approaches by making optimal use of the unique characteristics of a twin sample, by using identical twins as (nearly) perfect matched controls. We will make, among other datasets, use of data of the Netherlands Twin Register (www.tweelingenregister.org).


**Your profile**
----------------

* A (research) master in biological psychology, positive psychology, genetics, psychometrics, artificial intelligence, epidemiology or something along those lines
* Knowledge of statistical methods and statistical programming (R or Python)
* Experience with or interest in behaviour genetics and molecular genetic/ multi-omics methodology
* Experience in working with large datasets
* Interest in Wellbeing and Research
* Excellent English writing and speaking skills


As a university, we strive for equal opportunities for all, recognising that diversity takes many forms. We believe that diversity in all its complexity is invaluable for the quality of our teaching, research and service. We are always looking for talent with diverse backgrounds and experiences. This also means that we are committed to creating an inclusive community so that we can use diversity as an asset.


**What do we offer?**
---------------------


A challenging position in a socially engaged organisation. At VU Amsterdam, you contribute to education, research and service for a better world. And that is valuable. So in return for your efforts, we offer you:


* a salary of minimum € 2.770,00 (PhD) and maximum € 3.539,00 (PhD) gross per month, on a full-time basis. This is based on UFO profile PhD candidate.
* an employment contract of initially one year. If there is sufficient perspective, this will be extended to a total of 4 years. Your dissertation at the end of the fourth year forms the end of your employment contract.


We also offer you attractive fringe benefits and regulations. Some examples:


* A full-time 38-hour working week comes with a holiday leave entitlement of 232 hours per year. If you choose to work 40 hours, you have 96 extra holiday leave hours on an annual basis. For part-timers, this is calculated pro rata.
* 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus
* contribution to commuting expenses
* optional model for designing a personalized benefits package
* hybrid working enables a good work-life balance

**De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie!**

**Wie zoeken wij?**

Voor ons hoofdkantoor in Amersfoort zoeken wij per direct een AI Solutions Developer.

In deze rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verkennen en implementeren van de mogelijkheden van generative AI, zoals ChatGPT, om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren.

Je hebt een relevante WO-opleiding afgerond of bijna afgerond, zoals Informatica of Data Science, en beschikt over aantoonbare kennis en interesse op het gebied van AI, machine learning en data-analyse. Daarnaast heb je sterke analytische vaardigheden en ben je in staat om complexe technische problemen op te lossen. Ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python, R of Java is een vereiste, evenals kennis van cloud computing en ervaring met platforms zoals AWS, Azure of Google Cloud.

Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief samen te werken in een team zijn van essentieel belang. Je bent proactief, leergierig en kunt goed omgaan met veranderingen en uitdagingen. Daarnaast heb je een sterke drive om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en ICT-management.

**Wat ga je doen?**

Deze functie is nieuw binnen Lab21, wat betekent dat je een grote invloed hebt op de invulling ervan. Je zult een onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren. Als Junior ICT Manager speel je een belangrijke rol bij het implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen binnen ons bedrijf. Je werkt nauw samen met verschillende teams om de behoeften van de organisatie in kaart te brengen en technologische oplossingen aan te dragen. Je analyseert en optimaliseert bestaande systemen en processen en identificeert kansen om AI-technologieën toe te passen.

**Plaats in de organisatie:**

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

-------------------


  
Hoeveel kinkhoest, mazelen of COVID-19 besmettingen zijn er op dit moment in Nederland? Met jouw data skills help jij mee aan het beantwoorden van deze vragen. Hoe je het ook wendt of keert, werken bij het RIVM is een impactvolle baan.



Wat ga je doen



Als data scientist richt je je op het (adviseren over het) automatiseren van surveillance pipelines binnen het centrum Epidemiologie en Surveillance van Infectieziekten (EPI). Daarbij hoort het scripten van de data transformatie en het vertalen van data naar inzichtelijke outputs volgens de door het team ontwikkelde standaarden. De hiervoor gebruikte surveillance data zijn afkomstig uit verschillende databronnen, bijvoorbeeld meldingen gedaan door de GGD'en, NICE intensive care, ziekenhuis data, Infectieradar en data van de huisartsen peilstations. Een voorbeeld van de output van een geautomatiseerde surveillance pipeline die gebruikt maakt van meerdere van bovenstaande bronnen is griep, kijk op deze website hoe dit eruitziet: https://www.rivm.nl/griep-griepprik/feiten-en-cijfers.



Eén dag per week adviseer je collega’s over het bouwen van hun eigen surveillance pipelines. Een aantal dagen per maand ben je het aanspreekpunt voor technische vragen over de pipelines die binnen het centrum voor surveillance doeleinden worden gebruikt. Op andere dagen ben je zelf bezig met het bouwen en het beheer van pipelines en dashboards en draag je bij aan het efficiënter maken van de pipelines en rapportages. Je bent onderdeel van een gedreven team en levert direct een bijdrage aan het inzichtelijk maken van de beschikbare gegevens.



Verantwoordelijkheden:


* Efficiënte en correcte scripts.
* Ophalen van vraagstukken en deze correct en tijdig beantwoorden.
* Technisch ondersteunen van de epidemiologen.
* Tijdige oplevering rapportages, dashboards en andere outputs.


Uniek aan deze baan



De aard van de werkzaamheden vertoont een innovatief karakter, waardoor er volop gelegenheid is om kennis en expertise op te bouwen op het gebied van R en datastromen. Je neemt deel aan diverse projecten en processen, waarbij de nadruk ligt op het creëren van maatschappelijke relevantie via geavanceerde data science-methoden voor de surveillance van infectieziekten.



Afdeling



Vanuit de afdeling Data, Innovatie en Signalering (DIS) ondersteunen we met 30 medewerkers de rest van het centrum EPI op het gebied van datamanagement en BI, data science en privacy compliance. In totaal werken bij de afdeling DIS meer dan 25 data specialisten - waarvan negen bij het data science team - aan het gereed maken van surveillance data van onder andere de infectieziekten COVID-19, influenza en MPOX.



DIS heeft binnen EPI een centrale rol bij het standaardiseren van de surveillance datastromen van infectieziektes. Veel handmatige en (soms) ad hoc processen worden nu omgezet in gestandaardiseerde en geautomatiseerde processen. Het team werkt aan het (nog) efficiënter inrichten van deze standaarden en aan verdere uitrol binnen EPI. Het team geeft hiervoor advies aan collega’s over het bouwen van hun eigen surveillance pipelines. Het team vertaalt in overleg met epidemiologen deze gegevens naar inzichtelijke tabellen, grafieken, kaarten en rapporten. Deze worden gebruikt als basis voor regionaal, landelijk of internationaal beleid ten aanzien van de bestrijding van infectieziektes. Het team werkt in R (met Tidyverse) voor data pipelines, met GitLab voor version control, met R Markdown voor automatische rapportages en R Shiny voor dashboards.



Daarnaast wordt door middel van text mining data inzichtelijk gemaakt welke de epidemiologen kunnen gebruiken voor het surveillance proces. Op dit moment wordt er met (gen)AI verkent hoe deze technologie kan bijdragen aan onze werkzaamheden. Het team werkt binnen het centrum nauw samen met een team van epidemiologen, datamanagers en onderzoekers en daarbuiten ook met andere (data science) experts van de ICT-organisatie.



De werksfeer binnen ons team is open, vriendelijk, gedreven en nieuwsgierig. Iedereen is druk bezig met uiteenlopende projecten, maar staat toch open voor vragen en springt bij als dit nodig is. Jouw collega’s zijn over het algemeen zeer leergierig; innovatie en nieuwe ideeën worden aangemoedigd. Doordat er binnen dit team niet alleen softwareontwikkeling plaatsvindt, maar ook support en trainingen worden gegeven aan epidemiologen, is het team ook sociaal sterk verbonden met de andere afdelingen. Een goede, ontspannen werksfeer wordt bevorderd door een dagelijkse lunchwandeling in het bos, werkuitjes en borrels. Naast de werkdagen op kantoor (minimaal 2 dagen per week) is er ook ruimte om vanuit huis te werken en zo de privé-werk balans optimaal in te richten.



Interesse



Wil jij hieraan meewerken in de functie van data scientist? Stuur dan je sollicitatie aan Martijn van Rooijen, afdelingshoofd data, innovatie en signalering. Heb je eerst nog vragen over deze vacature, dan kan je Stijn Andeweg bereiken op 06-29651369.

We are the leading one-stop-shop for branded payments, making online recharge possible for anyone, anywhere at any time — whether you or someone you love needs credit for calling, gaming, entertainment or money. This is your chance to join an ambitious scaleup in a state of rapid growth; we’ll push you to develop yourself and help you create a real impact in your role. Put simply: we could write history together.

  

We won’t bore you with a corporate spiel about how we might be taking on the world of branded payments (spoiler: we are).



Instead, we’ll let the numbers speak for themselves: we bring consumers their favourite brands to their fingertips, with over 15,000 products available in every gift card category globally, $70 million in funding (and counting!), 20%+ growth in 2023.

  

We also have a revenue target of €75 million in 2024, we're just getting started with 1.1 million app downloads in 2023, we are counting 5.0+ million active customers, a presence in 180 countries and 25 markets, a team of 150+ employees and 40+ nationalities and 1 person missing — you.

  


We’re on the hunt for the hungriest and most passionate talent out there. If at any point your brain screams “I want in!” while you’re reading this, then consider this the sign you’ve been looking for: we want you too.

  

**The role**



We’re looking for a talented Business Analyst to join our Business Intelligence Team reporting to Nicolas Arrivé. You will work on improving our day to day business with a strong focus on our customers and marketing analytics.

  

You understand what kind of insights drive the right action. You have great analytical skills and are good at making people understand what needs to get done and why.  



  

The BI team embeds actionable insights into the business teams and drives commercial success (improving sales, margin and/or efficiency). Automation is also at the heart of our business practices when value can be extracted at scale.

 **What will I do?**



As a Senior Business Analyst you will play a vital part in defining our Marketing, customer base and product strategy.



You own relationships with Recharge directors and C-level executives, and therefore you are capable of articulating complex analytical or data topics into simple concepts to senior audiences.



You can articulate the positive business impact of your recommendations and insights.

  

You perform ad hoc advanced strategic analyses and provide the insights that help Customer, Marketing and Product teams improve the service(s) that Recharge offers and/or improve the commercial value for Recharge and our customers.


You are a de-facto code reviewer for the rest of the team for the code base you are the most proficient with.

  

You are proactively making the right trade-off between self-service analytics environments (Tableau reporting) and custom deliverables.

  

For example, we are working on a strategy to keep and nurture our most loyal customer base. We are working on strategies to win back customers who have churned within the previous 12 months. We help the Marketing team in being more efficient with their Marketing spend in acquiring the right customers. We also inform our product and engineering teams in optimising the users experience from discovery to purchases in app and on the web.

 **What you have:**


* 5+ years experience in an analytics and/or data-science related field (preferably within the e-commerce industry)
* 5+ years experience working with structured and unstructured data-sets as well as data extraction tools such as Hive and/or SQL
* Solid understanding of testing and modelling statistics (R2, p-value, t-test etc…)
* 1+ year experience with statistical software such as R, or coding language: Python
* 5+ years Experience with Data Visualisation tools (like Tableau and Power BI ideally)
* Hands-on experience with setting up test studies: A/B tests, Geo-experimentation and Lift studies

 **Nice to have:**


* Knowledge of analytics platforms, such as Google Analytics
* Advanced knowledge of Customer, Marketing Analytics and modelling such as price elasticity test and formula, Marketing Mix Models, LifeTime Value calculations etc…
* Bachelor’s degree in Business, Statistics, Data Science, Economics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Engineering, Sociology or similar
* Advanced knowledge of Python or R

 **What we offer**


* 30 days of holiday, a great pension scheme, and one of the best relocation packages in Amsterdam
* Flexible working hours and an office overlooking the Amstel
* Macbook Pro or Windows Laptop

* Free Dutch classes to help out with daily life in the Netherlands
* Regular parties, celebrations and other events

At Recharge we are dedicated to building a diverse, inclusive and authentic workplace, so if you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyway. You may be just the right candidate for this or other roles.

 **The process**


**1. Apply**: Want in? Let us know! Apply for a role and help us get to know your best self

Are you fascinated by sustainability issues and do you have experience and affinity with researching the effects of land use on climate? Then we are looking for you!***  

  

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research into monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).  

  

While the team’s main focus is on forests we also conduct research into the role of land use and forest management in greenhouse gas emissions and removals in a broader context involving the whole LULUCF sector, including other land uses. Team members are responsible for the compilation of the national greenhouse gas inventory for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. For this we develop and work with geographically explicit instruments (such as models and monitoring) that can be used to determine the effects of the management or change in land use of forests, cropland, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other land. We closely collaborate with other experts on land use and soil at Wageningen Environmental Research and external research institutes to bring together all required information for the LULUCF monitoring.  

  

We use our knowledge and tools to draw up the international (Climate Convention, Paris Agreement, EU) and national (Climate and Energy Outlook) reports of greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. With our science-based expertise we also support the development and evaluation of climate policy of the Dutch government and European Commission. For instance, we currently support the European Commission in drafting the methodologies for certification of carbon removals in forests, wetlands and agricultural soils (carbon farming).  

  

**Your duties and responsibilities:**  

As LULUCF researcher you will contribute to further improving our methodologies for calculating carbon stock changes towards higher Tier levels according to the IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. This will involve the compilation and collection of new emission factors for carbon stock changes in living biomass, dead organic matter or soils and/or emissions of methane or nitrous oxide due to land use or land use change.  

  

Depending on your expertise you will be responsible for the improvements for several land use categories covered by the LULUCF sector and/or the further development of spatially explicit approaches. You also contribute to the acquisition of new externally funded projects.  

  

**You will work here**  

You will be placed in the team SFE of WENR, based at the Wageningen Campus of Wageningen University and Research, but you will also collaborate intensively with colleagues in other teams at WENR as well as with researchers in other research institutes in the Netherlands and internationally.  

  

You will be working in an enthusiastic team of about 24 colleagues working on options for conservation, restoration, development and sustainable use of trees and forests from an ecological perspective. We focus on the way in which policy, management and climate affect ecological processes and what their consequences are for climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and restoration, delivery of ecosystem services and other specific policy goals.

**Omschrijving**
----------------


The Soil Physics and Land Management chair group at Wageningen University and Research is seeking a postdoc researcher in hydrological modelling who will be responsible for the numerical modelling work in project RESTARTIN: “Restructuring and enhancing strategies with a transformative approach for integrated water disaster management in India and the Netherlands”. This work will involve not only the modelling itself, but also the use of high-resolution satellite imagery to assess vegetation water conditions for calibration, the design of land-use change scenarios (eventually with modelling), and interactions with stakeholders and socioeconomic researchers to translate potential adaptation options into practice.  

Your duties and responsibilities include:

+ apply a surface and groundwater model to several regions in the Netherlands (Limburg, Brabant and Holland);
+ assess climate change scenarios and design compatible land-use scenarios;
+ assess the impact of climate change on flood and drought conditions;
+ test potential adaptation options in coordination with stakeholders;
+ some involvement in related educational activities is possible.
**You will work here**  

You will work in project RESTARTIN, jointly funded by NWO and DST-India. Most of the work will be developed within the Soil Physics and Land Management chair group in WUR. But it will be closely coordinated with researchers at IHE-Delft working on detailed risk assessment and socioeconomic analysis. It will also be closely linked with similar activities being performed by Indian researchers in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra. Some travelling to India is therefore expected.


The intended starting date of this position is 1 September 2024.

**Functie-eisen**
-----------------


You hold a PhD degree in hydro(geo)logy, environmental sciences or equivalent. You also possess:

+ strong and broad conceptual and methodological knowledge of hydrology at the soil-water-plant and watershed scales, including relevant numerical models (e.g., HEC-HMS/RAS, SWMM, HBV, SWAT, SHE, VIC, MODFLOW, CATHY, HGS, FEFLOW, DSSAT, etc.), and model calibration/validation techniques;
+ in-depth experience with GIS packages (e.g., ArcGIS, Qgis) and advanced data analysis techniques;
+ in-depth experience with scripting in R, MATLAB, Python, FORTRAN, etc.;
+ experience in scientific writing, conducting research, and a publication record in hydrology;
+ ability to work independently and to take ownership of the assigned tasks, including making independent decisions on implementation details.

In our international working environment, there is an increasing amount of communication in English. For this position it is about level C1.


You can see that there are plenty of challenges ahead of you. These challenges can also be seen as development opportunities. So, if you do not yet have the track-record required in the vacancy, but do have solid work experience, we would also like to invite you to apply.

----------------


Alcoholverslaving is een van de meest voorkomende psychiatrische stoornissen in Nederland. Hoewel alcoholverslaving 2 tot 3 keer vaker voorkomt bij mannen dan bij vrouwen, wordt dit verschil steeds kleiner. Daarnaast blijkt alcoholverslaving ruim 3 keer zo vaak voor te komen onder genderminderheden (transgender en genderdiverse personen) in vergelijking met cisgender personen. Helaas zijn sekse en genderverschillen in de ontwikkeling en behandeling van alcoholverslaving tot op heden beperkt onderzocht. Het doel van dit PhD project is om onderzoek te doen naar sekse en genderverschillen in stress-gerelateerd alcohol gebruik in zowel een klinische- als niet klinische populatie op basis van verschillende datasets. In deze datasets hebben we ondermeer data met betrekking tot subjectieve (hunkering) en fysiolische (hartslagvariabiliteit, cortisol) alcohol cue en stressreactiviteit gemeten in het lab, seksehormoonlevels evenals dagelijkse variaties in stress, hunkering en alcoholgebruik gemeten over een periode van 28 dagen (De SEGA2.0 studie) of 4 maanden (de SEGA studie).


Als PhD kandidaat zal je primaire focus zijn om de statistische analyses (zoals dynamic structural equation modells) voor deze complexe longitudinale en fysiologische data op te zetten en uit te voeren. Je zal hierbij niet alleen kijken naar biologische verschillen (zoals variaties in seksehormoonlevels) maar ook naar sociaalculturele genderverschillen, zoals variaties in genderexpressie. Daarnaast zal je de resultaten opschrijven in wetenschappelijke artikelen, met als uiteindelijk doel meer inzicht te krijgen in sekse- en genderverschillen in de werkingsmechanisme van verslaving.


LET OP: Omdat de data van dit project al zijn verzameld, betreft het hier een PhD traject van 3 jaar.


**Jouw taken**


* Het analyseren van complexe data, waaronder fysiologische en ecologische momentary assessment data middels geavanceerde statistiek zoals ‘dynamic structural equation modelling’
* Het schrijven van wetenschappelijke artikelen
* Naast je onderzoekstaken (90%) zal een deel van het werk bestaan uit het geven van onderwijs (10%) waaronder het begeleiden van bachelor en master theses en het superviseren van werkgroepen op het gebied van (neuro)psychologie


**Jouw profiel**
----------------

* Een (bijna) afgeronde research master op het gebied van psychologie, cognitieve neurowetenschappen, cognitieve wetenschappen of gerelateerd veld
	+ Omdat het een driejarig PhD project betreft, is het belangrijk dat de kandidaat een research master heeft afgerond of over vergelijkbare kwalificaties beschikt (een master van minimaal 120 ECTS, waarvan 60 ECTS besteed zijn aan onderzoeksvakken).
* Programeer vaardigheden (Matlab, Python, of R);
* Sterke statistische kwaliteiten, waarbij ervaring met het analyseren van complexe longitudinale data, middels (dynamic) structural equation modelling, een voordeel heeft.
* Beheersing van de Engelse taal in woord en geschrift; Beheersing van de Nederlandse taal is gewenst;
* Je hebt sterke communicatie vaardigheden, neemt initiatief en hebt interesse om in een multidisciplinair team te werken

-------------------


  
Wil jij verandering brengen in een van de grootste maatschappelijke uitdagingen van dit moment? Het ministerie van BZK/VRO werkt aan een goede volkshuisvesting, waarin iedereen een woning kan vinden die bij hem of haar past. Op dit moment is het voor veel mensen nog lastig om een betaalbare en passende woning te vinden. Daarom is het van groot belang dat ons beleid goed werkt en goed is onderbouwd. En daar kun jij als senior beleidsonderzoeker corporatiedata aan meewerken!


We zoeken een nieuwe collega voor de afdeling Kennis bij directie Wonen van BZK/VRO. Onze afdeling draagt bij aan het vormgeven en verbeteren van het woonbeleid. Dat doen we onder andere door het uitvoeren van beleidsanalyses en doorrekeningen t.b.v. (nieuw) beleid en het datamanagement van de basisonderzoeken en statistieken die nodig zijn voor deze analyses. Hiervoor hebben we een schat aan data tot onze beschikking. We verzorgen (opdrachtgevend) relatiebeheer met onderzoeksbureaus en (internationale) kennisinstellingen. Verder doet Kennis aan strategische beleidsadvisering en dragen we bij aan de monitoring van de voortgang van de Nationale Woon- en Bouwagenda en de Nationale Prestatieafspraken met woningcorporaties. De afdeling Kennis opereert als een spin in het web van de informatievoorziening en werkt continu samen met de andere afdelingen en directies. Daarbij ligt de nadruk sterk op het delen van relevante kennis en inzichten gericht op beleidsontwikkeling.


Bij de afdeling Kennis hebben we voor de senior beleidsonderzoekers twee profielen, namelijk één met een focus op de rol van onderzoeker i.c.m. kennismakelaar en de ander met meer nadruk op de rol van onderzoeker i.c.m. data-analist. De nu vacante functie betreft die tweede rol en dan specifiek gericht op data, analyse en monitoring op het gebied van de woningcorporatiesector.


Als senior beleidsonderzoeker corporatiedata bij de afdeling Kennis:

* werk je aan de gehele informatievoorziening rondom woningcorporaties. Het gaat om het proces van de jaarlijkse prognose- en verantwoordingsinformatie (dPi en dVi) over de activiteiten en de financiële positie van corporaties. Je werkt hiervoor nauw samen met de collega-afdeling Corporaties en binnen het samenwerkingsverband SBR-Wonen met de Autoriteit Woningcorporaties (Aw), Aedes en Waarborgfonds Sociale Woningbouw (WSW);
* word je namens BZK het aanspreekpunt binnen het samenwerkingsverband. Dit betekent dat je deelneemt aan het tactisch overleg, bepaal je mede de monitoringswensen rondom de corporatiesector en coördineer je de analyses t.b.v. kwaliteitsbewaking. Ook draag je bij aan het organiseren van een goede structuur, financiering en (data)governance m.b.t. AVG, doorleveringen, opslag en verwerking;
* vertaal je (beleids)vraagstukken van Corporaties en andere collega-afdelingen naar (data) onderzoeksvragen en voer je zelf analyses uit t.b.v. beleidsontwikkeling. Ook verzorg je afstemming met en opdrachtverlening aan datapartners en onderzoeksbureaus over projectvoorstellen, offertes en (samenwerkings)overeenkomsten;
* zorg je voor het uitbouwen van het Dashboard Prestatie Woningcorporaties In Kaart (PWIK), inclusief de jaarlijkse Indicatieve Bestedingsruimte Woningcorporaties (IBW) en andere monitors, waaronder de Monitor Besluit Toegelaten Instellingen Volkshuisvesting (BTiV);
* word je namens de afdeling thematrekker van het kennisdossier woningcorporaties en ben je daarmee een belangrijke schakel tussen de afdelingen Kennis en Corporaties. Je werkt vanuit Kennis mee aan het verbeteren van het beleid gericht op de corporatiesector.

  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
Je bent onze ideale kandidaat als je kennis hebt van de corporatiesector i.r.t. data en onderzoek. Dus we vragen veel, maar geen enkel mens is een duizendpoot. Je hoeft echt niet op*alle*onderdelen even hoog te scoren. Als jij jezelf herkent in onderstaand profiel, dan horen we graag van je:

* Je hebt minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring met het uitvoeren van complex kwantitatief en kwalitatief onderzoek en het opzetten en aansturen van datagedreven projecten;
* Je bouwt aan relaties, zowel intern als met externe organisaties. Je communiceert daarbij gemakkelijk op verschillende niveaus, met oog voor verschillende belangen;
* Je kan zelfstandig (data) analyses uitvoeren en deze helder opschrijven en presenteren;
* Je bent goed thuis in pakketten als SPSS en/of R en je deelt jouw kennis hierover graag met de afdeling;


Pluspunten (maar wat je bij ons ook gaandeweg nog mag ontwikkelen) zijn als je je makkelijk beweegt in een politiek sensitieve omgeving, je specifieke kennis en ervaring hebt met financieel-economische vraagstukken die relevant is voor de woningcorporatiesector en je over stevige adviesvaardigheden beschikt.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



Het ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties (BZK) werkt aan brede maatschappelijke en politieke opgaven, bijvoorbeeld aan een efficiënte bouw- en woningmarkt en één effectieve rijksdienst met een efficiënt functionerende bedrijfsvoering. Zo zijn we ook verantwoordelijk voor efficiënt beheer en ontwikkeling van het rijksvastgoed en een goede ontwikkeling van bestuurders en ambtenaren. We beschermen de nationale veiligheid en waarborgen de grondwet en koninkrijksrelaties. BZK is de hoeder van de democratie.


De directie Wonen is binnen het ministerie van BZK verantwoordelijk voor beleid en regelgeving voor de huursector, de woningcorporaties en de koopmarkt. De directie is onderverdeeld in zes afdelingen die onderling nauw samenwerken: Kennis, Huurbeleid, Huurtoeslag, Inkomensondersteuning en Caribisch Nederland, Aandachtsgroepen, Corporaties en Koop- en Kapitaalmarkt. Het beleid rond wonen staat politiek en maatschappelijk sterk in de aandacht en dat heeft zijn weerslag op het werk bij de directie. Het werk kenmerkt zich door een grote dynamiek, gedreven door actualiteit en met veel contacten met partijen in de samenleving en binnen de Rijksoverheid.


De afdeling Kennis versterkt de onderbouwing en monitoring van huidig en toekomstig beleid. Kennis vatten we breed op: van het onderhouden en verbeteren van de informatievoorziening (o.a. Woonbase, WoON, Datawonen.nl, samenwerking met partijen als Kadaster, CBS en ABF) tot het netwerken met en aansturen van planbureaus, universiteiten en (inter)nationale instellingen. De afdeling Kennis coördineert de integrale voortgangsrapportageStaat van de Volkshuisvesting(met bijbehorendepubliciteit), de ontwikkeling van dashboards, deelname aan IBO’s, beleidsdoorlichting en strategische beleidsontwikkeling en de directiebrede onderzoeksagenda wonen.



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.

-------------------


  
Daarnaast wordt het relatief onbekende transportgedrag van verschillende PFAS in de ondergrond door jou modelmatig verkend en worden de risico’s onderzocht voor het drinkwater in Nederland. De door jou ontwikkelde kennis is nodig voor het maken van ruimtelijke afwegingen voor bodem en ondergrond en het waarborgen van een gezonde leefomgeving.



Dit doe jij:


* Je bent inhoudelijk specialist bij het berekenen van uitloging en verspreiding van chemische stoffen. Deze stoffen kunnen vrijkomen mede als gevolg van circulaire economie of door diffuus vervuilde gebieden in Nederland;
* Je bent betrokken bij het gebruik en het verder ontwikkelen van modellen voor bodemtransport en uitloging en je past de modellen toe in de praktijk;
* Jouw modelkennis van uitloging en transport wordt gevraagd in de monitoring en risicobeoordeling van bestaande en opkomende stoffen, ‘chemicals of emerging concern’. Nieuwe probleemstoffen zijn vaak mobiel en persistent en komen daardoor in de ondergrond en het grondwater terecht;
* Je werkt mee aan integratie van kennis over gedrag van chemische stoffen in het bodem-water systeem;
* Je licht jouw onderzoeksresultaten toe in rapportages voor onze opdrachtgevers.


Je werkt geregeld aan meerdere projecten tegelijk en krijgt binnen de kaders van jouw onderzoeksopdracht de ruimte om zelf na te denken over onderzoeksmethoden en daarmee creatief te zijn in het beantwoorden van de vraag. Bij het ene onderzoek ben je meer bezig met modelleren, in het andere onderzoek kijk je juist naar de samenhang tussen wetenschap en beleid. Je werkt aan projecten die de nodige aandacht krijgen vanuit beleid en maatschappij, dit maakt het een interessant, relevant en dynamisch werkveld.



Uniek aan deze baan  

In deze functie krijg je de kans om jouw wetenschappelijke kennis verder te ontwikkelen en toe te passen op uitdagende en maatschappelijke relevante vraagstukken. Je werkt met veel partijen interdisciplinair samen zowel binnen als buiten het RIVM. Je teamgenoten zijn intrinsiek gedreven collega’s, samen maken jullie impact en werken jullie aan nieuwe wetenschappelijke methodes en inzichten voor een groene, gezonde en duurzame leefomgeving.



Omdat jouw team uit verschillende disciplines bestaat, is er ruimte om in de diepte op vraagstukken in te gaan en kun je veel leren van je collega’s. We zijn een groep met een laagdrempelige en open cultuur en zien elkaar met de rest van de afdeling erbij ook regelmatig voor leuke activiteiten, zoals een middagje zeilen of een excursie naar een natuurgebied.



Je krijgt bij ons voldoende mogelijkheid om over zowel de inhoud te sparren, zoals met je teamleden uit de projecten waarin je werkt, als op persoonlijk gebied, zoals met je manager of een buddy.



Dit wordt jouw afdeling  

Bij het RIVM werken we met ruim 2500 collega’s elke dag samen aan de zorg van morgen. Je komt terecht op onze afdeling Duurzame Bodem, Drinkwater en Biodiversiteit, waar je in verschillende teams werkt aan de ontwikkeling van methoden en modellen voor de risicobeoordeling van stoffen. Onder andere voor de opgaven voor de kwaliteit van bodem en grondwater. We adviseren alle overheidslagen over bodembeleidsontwikkeling en –uitvoering. We werken in opdracht van ministeries en overheden, samen met andere kennisinstellingen en maatschappelijke organisaties aan een veilig, gezond en duurzaam gebruik van bodem en ondergrond.



Meer informatie  

Heb je interesse in deze positie, maar eerst nog wat vragen? Bel gerust met afdelingshoofd Theo Traas (06-4686 0947) of met onze recruiter Michelle van de Beurcht (06-460 75 150).


  
Functie-eisen

Dit neem je mee  

Dit is een functie waarbij je met veel verschillende disciplines samenwerkt, daarom is het nodig dat je je kunt verplaatsen in de problematiek van de probleemhebbers. We werken veel in teamverband, daarom verwachten we dat je, naast dat je goed zelfstandig kunt werken, ook een prettige collega bent.



Verder vragen wij:


* Je hebt een afgeronde wetenschappelijke opleiding zoals bodemkunde, hydrologie, milieukunde of aanverwant. In je studie heb je gewerkt aan grondwaterkwaliteit of bodemfuncties of je bent in staat om vanuit je opleiding een logische brug hiernaar te slaan. Door jouw studie heb je ook aantoonbare kennis van het gedrag van stoffen in het milieu en daarop gebaseerde risicobeoordeling;
* Daarbij heb je kennis van data-analyse en visualisatie met de door het RIVM gebruikte programmeertalen Python of R;
* Je hebt ervaring opgedaan in het doen van onderzoek, het geven van toelichtingen en het leveren van bijdragen aan publicaties. Dit kan ook tijdens je opleiding zijn geweest;
* Je hebt affiniteit met milieuchemische bodemmodellen en hebt ervaring met of bent bereid je te verdiepen in het model HYDRUS-1D. Kennis van ORCHESTRA is een pre;
* Je spreekt en schrijft goed Nederlands. Veel wetenschappelijke literatuur is in het Nederlands en je hebt regelmatig contact met organisaties buiten het RIVM, waar Nederlands voor nodig is. Ook is veel wetenschappelijke literatuur in het Engels, daarom is een goed begrip van Engels ook nodig voor deze functie.

-------------------


  
Are you an ambitious bioinformatician with a solid background in omics data analysis and experience in the field of immunology and/or infectious disease research? Then this bioinformatician position is the job for you!



Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”



Unique to this job  

We are an international, dynamic, highly motivated team of scientists at different stages of our careers with a strong drive to push research for the benefit of Public Health.

-------------------------


Binnen deze vacature zal je een gecombineerde functie hebben:


* Je zal voor 50% aan de slag gaan als promovendus;
* Je zal voor 50% werken als data analist/datamanager.


### **PhD onderzoek**


Je onderzoek zal gericht zijn op het hergebruiken van routinematig verzamelde zorgdata en administratieve data om de Nederlandse Intensive Care Evaluatie (NICE)-kwaliteitsregistratie te optimaliseren voor het meten en verbeteren van de kwaliteit van IC-zorg en de administratieve lasten voor zorgverleners te verminderen.


### **Data analist/datamanager**


De Nationale Intensive Care Evaluatie (NICE) registratie verzamelt gegevens over alle opnamen op Nederlandse IC’s, ongeveer 75.000 IC-opnamen per jaar. Met behulp van spiegelinformatie kunnen individuele IC’s hun uitkomsten vergelijken met andere IC’s en daarmee achterhalen waar ruimte voor kwaliteitsverbetering is. Tevens is de NICE registratie een belangrijke bron voor klinisch onderzoek. Het is de missie van NICE om de kwaliteit van de IC-zorg in Nederland te bewaken en te verbeteren via een geïntegreerde, hoogwaardige en innovatieve aanpak in samenwerking met diverse partijen, zoals NVIC, FCIC en RIVM.


**Wat ga je doen**
------------------


Als **PhD student** zal je samen met zorgprofessionals en je dagelijks begeleiders onderzoeken:


* In welke mate de kwaliteit van de data, die geautomatiseerd en real-time vanuit de ziekenhuisbronsystemen wordt aangeleverd, toereikend is voor hergebruik in een landelijke kwaliteitsregistratie om de kwaliteit van zorg te evalueren;
* Wat ervoor nodig is om een screeningsvragenlijst te standaardiseren en te implementeren in het elektronisch patiëntendossier, zodat ook patiënt-gerapporteerde uitkomstmaten (PROMs) van de IC-populatie beschikbaar komen voor de kwaliteitsregistratie en evaluatie van zorg;
* Wat ervoor nodig is om IC-gegevens uit de NICE-registratie te verrijken met data uit externe bronnen zoals LBZ-DHD en Vektis, zodat we beschikbare administratieve data beter benutten voor de kwaliteitsregistratie en meer inzicht krijgen in complicaties, kosten en patiëntuitkomsten van de IC-patiënten.


Je monitort hierbij eventuele belemmeringen en doet aanbevelingen om de gegevensaanlevering te optimaliseren. De onderzoeksresultaten beschrijf je in wetenschappelijke publicaties en presenteer je op (internationale) congressen en bijeenkomsten. Dit werk zal uitmonden in een proefschrift gebaseerd op internationale, peer-reviewed publicaties.


Als **data analist/datamanager** zal je een bijdrage leveren aan de NICE studie door:


* Het verzamelen, controleren, analyseren en rapporteren van de data die door de IC’s wordt aangeleverd en die vervolgens gebruikt kunnen worden voor kwaliteitsverbeterprojecten, onderzoek en innovatie van IC-zorg;
* Het uitvoeren van on-site controles bij de aanleverende IC's om de datakwaliteit te waarborgen;
* Het beantwoorden van vragen vanuit onze deelnemers om hen zo goed mogelijk te ondersteunen bij het juist registreren van de gegevens.


De taken als Data Analist voer je uit in samenwerking met je collega data analisten/datamanagers, data monitor en onze software engineers.


**Wat neem je mee**
-------------------


Je beschikt over uitstekende communicatieve en contactuele eigenschappen. Jij kunt contact leggen en onderhouden met betrokken partijen en je kunt goed samenwerken. Verder kun je ook goed zelfstandig werken en initiatieven ontplooien. Je bent analytisch, accuraat, hebt affiniteit met de medische wereld en een passie voor puzzelen met big data. Daarnaast heb je:


* Een afgeronde universitaire masteropleiding zoals Medische Informatiekunde, Bio informatica, Gezondheidswetenschappen, Data Science of Kunstmatige Intelligentie;
* Ervaring met programmeertalen SQL en R en/of Python;
* Affiniteit met statistische methoden, machine learning (ML/AI) en dataverwerkingstechnieken;
* Ervaring met BI tools is een pre;
* Een goede beheersing van de Nederlandse en Engelse taal wat betreft spreek- en schrijfvaardigheid.


**Wat bieden we jou**
---------------------

* Een vliegende start van jouw carrière in het onderzoekswerk.
* Alle ruimte voor jouw drive om de zorg van morgen vorm te geven.

**A PhD student in Social Network Analysis and Behavioral Choices Research**  


Position in brief  

School: Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences  

Department: Methodology and Statistics  

Location: Tilburg  

Monthly full-time gross salary: €2.770 (first year) - €3.539 (fourth year)  

Duration of employment contract: 4 years (12 + 36 months)
Weekly hours: 40 hours  


**Project description**  

This PhD project aims to identify key factors influencing individuals' preferences for their living neighborhoods, taking into account the critical role of social networks. Traditional approaches often focus solely on individual characteristics and preferences, overlooking the significant impact that social connections can have on such decisions. This research seeks to address this gap by exploring how individuals' social positions within their interpersonal networks affect their susceptibility to social influence and subsequent living-arrangement decisions. Utilizing advanced network analysis techniques to assess the structures and dynamics of social networks, combined with behavioral choice models, this study aims to create an integrated modeling framework. This approach will disentangle the various triggers affecting decision-making processes. Data collection will include individual demographics, neighborhood preferences, and detailed information about interpersonal networks. The insights gained from this research will have substantial implications for urban planning, community development, and social policy, particularly in the context of housing scarcity.  


**Background**  

The research will be led by Dr. Li Zeng and Dr. Francisco Bahamonde-Birke with expertise in network analysis and machine learning, and behavioral decision-making and choice modeling, respectively. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the project, regular collaborative team meetings will ensure consistency and integration across the research lines. This project addresses the current limitations in understanding neighborhood choice by considering the influence of social networks, which has been largely neglected in previous studies. By combining network analysis and behavioral choice modeling, the study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors shaping neighborhood preferences. This research is particularly relevant in the context of the Netherlands' housing scarcity, where accurate insights can inform more effective and unbiased policy-making. The expected outcomes will contribute to a deeper understanding of how social influences shape individual preferences, providing valuable guidance for urban planning and social policy.  


**Your position**  

The PhD position is integral to a broader research initiative, which includes other PhD students and staff members. As a PhD candidate, your role will involve conducting research in the realm of social network analysis and behavioral choice modeling.

**Universiteit Maastricht**  

Waarom werken aan de Universiteit Maastricht?

  

  

Aan de Universiteit Maastricht (UM) draait alles om de toekomst. Die van onze studenten omdat we ze een stevige, brede basis geven voor de rest van hun leven. En die van ons allemaal door ons onderzoek naar oplossingen voor vraagstukken in de hele wereld. Met onze zes faculteiten zorgen we voor een veelomvattend aanbod aan onderwijs en onderzoek.  

  

In ons onderwijs werken we met de methode Probleemgestuurd Onderwijs (PGO). Dit betekent dat onze studenten in kleine groepen zélf op zoek gaan naar oplossingen voor problemen en vraagstukken. Ze discussiëren samen, trekken conclusies, formuleren een antwoord en presenteren dat aan de hele groep. Zo doen ze belangrijke vaardigheden op voor hun hele loopbaan.  

  

De UM heeft op dit moment meer dan 22.300 studenten en ruim 5.000 medewerkers uit alle windstreken. Dat zorgt voor een inspirerende en bruisende internationale gemeenschap.  

  

Spreekt deze internationale omgeving waarin de wetenschap centraal staat jou aan? En wil jij hier vanuit een wetenschappelijke of juist staffunctie een steentje aan bijdragen? Dan ben jij met jouw unieke bijdrage van harte welkom! Want als jonge Europese Universiteit van Maastricht bieden we perspectief dat we vertalen naar jouw talent. Je bent waardevol voor onze universiteit en de maatschappij en we inspireren je om met trots en plezier samen te groeien.

0.8 FTE, 5 years



The overarching goal of this project is to characterize the influence of linguistic context, tonal language experience, and pitch sensitivity on neural control of pitch. To elucidate the influence of linguistic context on neural pitch control, the first aim is to investigate the neural processes (via electroencephalography, EEG) that underlie pitch monitoring in linguistic (language) versus non-linguistic (acoustics) contexts. To determine the role of tonal languages in linguistic and non-linguistic aspects of pitch control, the neural processes underlying these contexts will be assessed in both tonal and non-tonal language speakers. We are open to additional and/or complimentary ideas from the candidates that can potentially expand the project.



The PhD candidate will be enrolled in the Graduate School for the Humanities and will be involved in the Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Research School (BCN), embedded within the Center for Language and Cognition Groningen (CLCG). The project will be conducted within the Speech Lab Group, Speech Biosignal Processing Lab (https://aburlab.web.rug.nl/), and Computational Linguistics Department. The experimental data collection will be via the mobile sound booth van “SPRAAKLAB” at the Faculty of Arts provides state-of-the-art speech (articulation) recording equipment, analysis tools, and a mobile laboratory. Candidates will also be expected to participate in public engagement events (including festivals such as Noorderzon, Lowlands, etc.). This project is primarily supervised by Dr. Defne Abur, who brings expertise in speech motor control and vocal pitch processing, and Dr. Frank Tsiwah, who brings expertise in neural processing of language and machine learning techniques for linguistics research.

-------------------


Bij HDSR werken we samen aan schoon en voldoende water. Goede informatie vormt de basis van ons werk. Op basis van jouw ordening en analyse van data en tijdreeksen kunnen wij zorgen voor een goed functionerend watersysteem.


Als Databeheerder Monitoring Waterkwantiteit en Waterkwaliteit zorg je ervoor dat de ruwe data wordt omgezet in betrouwbare en relevante waterinformatie. Dit doen wij voor interne vraagstukken, maar ook voor die van inwoners van ons gebied. Een voorbeeld hiervan is een agrariër die meer inzicht wil krijgen in de werking van een stuw. Die kan nu op ons Open Water Data-portaal opzoeken of hij voldoende water heeft in tijden van droogte en geen wateroverlast krijgt tijdens hevige neerslag. Jij verzamelt data, monitort dit, maakt het inzichtelijk en ontsluit het via webservices. Daarbij zijn de historische tijdreeksen in de FEWS-datasystemen essentieel. Het waterbeheer in ons gebied is uitdagend door de diversiteit aan bodemtypes (veen, klei, zand). Dit maakt jouw werk afwisselend bij de beoordeling van de datakwaliteit.


Hier komt uiteraard nog meer bij kijken:


* Beheren van (webgebaseerde) datakoppelingen met externe en interne partijen.
* Configureren van meetpunten, (sub)parameters, validatieregels, visualisatie en exports.
* Toezien op wijzigingen in FEWS-configuratie door een externe partij.
* In samenwerking met bronhouders oplossen van problemen rondom imports.
* Op elkaar afstemmen van databeheer van monitoring waterkwaliteit en -kwantiteit.
* Beheren van scripts voor conversie en consistentie-checks met het oog op datakwaliteit.
* Helpen bij inrichten van gebruiker-specifieke kanalen voor hun informatiebehoefte.
* Documenteren van onderbouwing van gemaakte keuzes in het databeheer.
* Uitleg geven aan collega’s over de data en werking van FEWS als databeheersysteem.


**In dit team kom je te werken**
--------------------------------


Jij bent als Databeheerder onderdeel van het team Informatie en Kennis. Een team met ongeveer 35 professionals op het gebied hydrologie, ecologie, waterkwaliteit en waterkwantiteit, inclusief bijkomende monitoring en databeheer. Als team geven wij advies bij vragen vanuit beheer, beleid, programma’s en projecten. Wij zijn ook regelmatig actief buiten HDSR om samen met andere waterschappen, kennisinstellingen en landelijke samenwerkingsverbanden kennis te delen en innovaties verder te brengen in de praktijk. We zijn een hecht en gedreven team dat altijd open staat voor nieuwe ideeën en kennis. Zo leren we met en van elkaar en blijven we groeien.


**“*****Ik word blij van het puzzelen met data en*** ***het gebruiken van*** ***scripts. Met dat wat ik het liefste doe, bespaar ik mijn collega’s veel tijd bij het maken van een goede analyse*** **“**- Ciska, Databeheerder.

Dit salaris is opgebouwd uit een bruto basissalaris van maximaal € 5.271,- (schaal 10 cao waterschappen), en een Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB) van 21% (inclusief 8% vakantiegeld). Je kunt zelf bepalen hoe je jouw IKB-budget inzet. Je kunt er extra vakantiedagen van opnemen of het maandelijks laten uitbetalen;
* je krijgt een laptop en een smartphone en bovendien een vergoeding van € 3,- netto per thuiswerkdag plus een vergoeding van maximaal € 850,- om je thuiswerkplek in te richten;
* voor jouw groei en ontwikkeling krijg je ook nog een persoonlijk budget van € 6.000,- om te besteden aan opleidingen, cursussen, trainingen en vitaliteit;
* reiskostenvergoeding en een fijne werkplek die goed bereikbaar is met het openbaar vervoer;
* een goede pensioenregeling;
* je krijgt een arbeidsovereenkomst voor de duur van een jaar met uitzicht op een vast contract.


**Wat maakt jou succesvol?**
----------------------------


Als Databeheerder Monitoring Waterkwantiteit en Waterkwaliteit ga je secuur te werk. Je houdt het overzicht, weet realistisch te plannen en legt jouw werk helder vast. Dankzij jouw communicatieve vaardigheden kun je jouw collega’s goed adviseren en jouw bevindingen uitdragen. Je luistert actief en durft door te vragen.

Current statistical methodology still reflects the use-context of its first development in the 1920s: methods assume that researchers make all important analysis choices before gathering the data. In modern data science age, however, data-driven paradigms have become dominant: many measurements are gathered simultaneously and it is often natural to pursue research questions that were not of obvious interest a priori. Looking at the data is scientifically sensible to do, but the problem is that current statistical methods cannot handle this behaviour well. What is needed for this, is the right mathematical framework, that gives the necessary error control guarantees without all the old restrictive assumptions. In this PhD project you will develop such mathematical foundations by bringing together exciting novel developments in mathematical statistics and machine learning theory, among which: closed testing, bandits, and the new theory of hypothesis testing with e-values, co-developed by your supervisor Dr. Rianne de Heide.



You will:


* Perform daily PhD-level research
* Publish results in journals and conference proceedings, and present these at (inter)national workshops and conferences.
* Contribute to teaching activities related to your work.
* Be a part of an excellent young research group, and benefit from frequent (virtual) interaction with other internationally renowned research groups working on e-values, such as at CWI (Amsterdam), LUMC (Leiden) and in the US.

We are an inclusive group and diversity is at the heart of our research principles. We care about a good working atmosphere and a good work-life balance. Applications from all groups currently under-represented in academic posts are especially encouraged. We particularly encourage women and people from minority groups to apply.


### **Your profile**

* You have, or will shortly acquire a master degree in (applied) mathematics or a related degree with a strong theoretical mathematical component. Enthusiasm for the topic of the project is more important than your choice of specialization in your master’s.
* You have excellent proficiency in English in speaking and writing (C1; above IELTS 7 or equivalent)..
* Scientific programming skills are a plus, e.g. in R, Python, C++, Julia, etc.
### **Our offer**

* As a PhD candidate at UT, you will be appointed to a full-time position for four years, with a qualifier in the first year, within a very stimulating and exciting scientific environment;
* The University offers a dynamic ecosystem with enthusiastic colleagues;
* Your salary and associated conditions are in accordance with the collective labour agreement for Dutch universities (CAO-NU);
* You will receive a gross monthly salary ranging from € 2.770,- (first year) to € 3.539,- (fourth year);
* There are excellent benefits including a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%, and a solid pension scheme;
* The flexibility to work partially from home;
* A minimum of 232 leave hours in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A full-time employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.
* Free access to sports facilities on campus
* A family-friendly institution that offers parental leave (both paid and unpaid);
* You will have a training programme as part of the Twente Graduate School where you and your supervisors will determine a plan for a suitable education and supervision;
* We encourage a high degree of responsibility and independence, while collaborating with close colleagues, researchers and other staff.
### **Information and application**

Until now, TSO national markets for flexible power delivery were in most cases accessible only to large B2B market players with large industrial power generation and power consumption assets such as power plants or industrial production lines. Since these balancing markets present an opportunity of billions across Europe annually, there’s a great potential value for aggregated DER to participate in these markets, thereby unlocking a huge volume of additional flexibility for TSOs and DSOs for balancing and congestion management. Equigy’s CBP realizes this ambition, amongst others by creating an easy and standardized market access for aggregators to encourage more participation of DER in today’s markets.

**De functie**
--------------


Amsterdam digitaliseert steeds verder, en onze ambities zijn hierin groot. Want wij kunnen immers met behulp van technologie het leven in onze stad verbeteren en gemakkelijker maken. Zo lossen wij stedelijke uitdagingen op die direct impact hebben op onze inwoners. Denk daarbij bij voorbeeld aan het inzetten van data bij grote Amsterdamse opgaven, zoals de overgang van aardgas naar alternatieve brandstoffen, de toenemende drukte in de stad of bij de armoedebestrijding. Maar ook het toegankelijker maken van onze diensten voor burgers, bezoekers, onze collega’s of ondernemers. Als onze nieuwe cloud engineer sta je hier midden in en werk je mee aan projecten met een grote maatschappelijke impact vanuit een team dat zich inzet voor een betere en duurzamere Amsterdam.



Bij de gemeente Amsterdam werken we aan aan een betere stad voor iedereen. Als cloud engineer versterk je onze vakgroep softwareontwikkeling, die bestaat uit 120 professionals. Hier werken we met verschillende teams, bestaande uit onder andere cloud engineers, softwareontwikkelaars, datascientists en product owners. Dit realiseren we met ontwikkelteams die ieder hun eigen producten ontwikkelen en beheren, in dit geval team AI & Data Analytics (AIDA) dat werkt aan digitale oplossingen voor de onderzoekers van de stad. Ons dataplatform bouwt aan duurzame oplossingen voor onze burgers en medewerkers in de Azure Cloud. We werken aan vooruitstrevende projecten in de stad, en denken na over hoe we AI en andere diensten in de cloud op een ethische, groene en efficiënte manier inzetten - zodat ons werk de hele stad en haar burgers ten goede komt.



Als onze nieuwe cloud engineer help je mee aan uiteenlopende uitdagingen en projecten. Momenteel werken we oa aan een project gericht op ChatGPT voor gemeentemedewerkers. Daarbij ontwikkelt het team een op ChatGPT-gebaseerde chatbot die medewerkers helpt bij het beantwoorden van vragen en het vinden van informatie binnen onze systemen. Ook werken we aan een platform voor Postgres/PowerBI/AML, waarbij we verschillende diensten in Azure leveren, denk aan een postgres database, Azure Machine Learning, en PowerBI omop een slimme, veilige en snelle manier data te visualiseren, te verwerken en op te slaan. Of werken we aan een hackathon: hoe host je een groene ChatGPT-achtige applicatie? We weten wat de ecologische voetafdruk is van software en applicaties die in de cloud worden gehost en verminderen waar dat kan. Daarom heeft het team de Amsterdam Eco Challenge georganiseerd: een hackathon met de focus op het ontwikkelen van een duurzame applicatie in de Azure cloud.


Dit doe je op een gemiddelde dag
--------------------------------

* Samen sta je sterker: je start je dag vaak met een stand-up meeting waarin je samen met je team de voortgang bespreekt en taken voor de dag verdeelt. Zo werk je werkt nauw samen met datascientists, data-engineers en het cloud team
* Ontwerpen en beheren van cloud-infrastructuur: vervolgens werk je aan het maken van een ARM template om resources te deployen in onze Azure omgeving. Je bent voortdurend bezig met het automatiseren van platformwerkzaamheden door middel van Infrastructure as Code (IaC) en CI/CD-pipelines.
* Beveiliging en naleving: je hebt een meeting met Risk over het waarborgen van de beveiliging van onze systemen en het naleven van regelgeving - een belangrijk onderdeel van je werk. Je zorgt er zo voor dat onze cloud-infrastructuur voldoet aan de hoogste veiligheidsstandaarden en werkt volgens de DevSecOps-principes.
* Continu leren en ontwikkelen: In de middag kies je een onderwerp om meer over te leren, om zo nieuwe vaardigheden en technologieën te verkennen. Elke sprint krijg je een dagdeel om te besteden aan training of het bijwonen van een workshop, zodat je altijd op de hoogte blijft van de nieuwste ontwikkelingen.


Hier ga je aan de slag
----------------------

We willen een goede werkgever zijn die ervoor zorgt dat alle collega’s zich gezien en gewaardeerd voelen. We koesteren verschillen tussen collega’s, al die verschillen zorgen voor betere resultaten voor onze organisatie én onze stad. We streven daarbij naar een personeelsbestand dat een afspiegeling is van de beroepsbevolking van Amsterdam. Dus wie jij ook bent: bij ons ben je van harte welkom!

**Digitalisering bij gemeente Amsterdam**


Amsterdam is een unieke stad. Aantrekkelijk om te wonen, werken en studeren en toonaangevend als dynamische internationale metropool. Tegelijkertijd staat de stad voor een grote uitdaging. De snelle verandering van onze samenleving leidt tot nieuwe opgaven voor de stad. Vaak hebben die opgaven digitaliseringsvraagstukken waarvoor softwareontwikkeling nodig is. De stad werkt opgavegericht met multidisciplinaire (DevOps) ontwikkelteams. Deze teams werken aan algemene voorzieningen zoals een dataplatform, App framework en componenten bibliotheek. Maar ook aan applicaties die collega’s en burgers ondersteunen. De applicaties die jij ontwikkelt hebben een groot bereik en maatschappelijke impact op de stad.

**Vakgroep Softwareontwikkeling**


De vakgroep softwareontwikkeling bestaat uit 120 professionals en levert mensen en kennis aan ontwikkelteams in de stad. De vakgroep zorgt voor ontwikkelstandaarden, stimuleert samenwerking middels gildes en faciliteert hergebruik van code middels generieke componenten. De vakgroep is onderdeel van de directie Digitale Voorzieningen binnen de IT-organisatie (DII) van de stad. Deze directie draagt zorg voor het ontwikkelen en beheren van kwalitatief hoogstaande digitale diensten.

**Wat doe je als Business Analist?**
------------------------------------

Weet jij van nature de vraag achter de vraag te herkennen en ben jij toe aan een volgende stap in je loopbaan? Lijkt het je mooi om te werken binnen een organisatie waarbij duurzaamheid centraal staat en waar volop kansen ontstaan naar aanleiding van de Energietransitie? Als je nu denkt; ja! Lees dan vooral verder.



Als Business Analist onderzoek én analyseer je businessprocessen, informatiestromen en behoeften aan het begin en gedurende een project. Dit doe jij in samenwerking met de producteigenaar en de betrokken business stakeholders (inclusief team data en IT).



Mede dankzij jouw inzet wordt de businessvraag duidelijk en sluit de oplossing aan op de gewenste verandering. IT en softwareontwikkeling is hierbij vaak een essentieel onderdeel voor de invulling van de verandering. De focus ligt hierbij op de software die de business unit Meten ondersteunt, waarbij jouw aandacht voornamelijk ligt bij de transitie naar het nieuwe energie data platform Energyworx en het ontwikkelen van een data gedreven visie.

  



Een greep uit je takenpakket:


* Je bent het eerste aanspreekpunt voor het uitwerken van veranderingen voor de business.
* Onderzoekt en analyseert businessprocessen, informatiestromen en behoeften en vertaald deze in resultaat gerichte oplossingen naar businessplannen.
* Draagt de businessplannen op een heldere en enthousiaste manier uit en creëert hiermee draagvlak, ook richting het MT.
* Analyseert de benodigde informatie en documenten.
* Stelt functionele specificaties (functioneel ontwerp/userstories/requirements) op en stemt deze af met de productowner.
* Je bent klankbord tijdens het project voor diverse stakeholders
* Houdt ontwikkelingen en innovaties bij voor het eigen aandachtsgebied (o.a. technische kennis en goed begrip van IT) en ziet de impact hiervan en zorgt voor een juiste kennisniveau bij zichzelf en anderen.
* Draagt actief bij aan de visie, strategie en jaarplannen voor data/IT processen en onderhoudt daardoor een breed netwerk in de organisatie.


Kortom, als Business Analist ben je de drijvende kracht achter het inventariseren en concretiseren van abstracte multidisciplinaire vraagstukken, waarvoor een helicopterview en goed begrip van de business unit nodig zijn.


#### **Over het team**



Interne Organisatie heeft een faciliterende rol aan de business waarbij de afdeling IT een cruciale rol heeft. Deze afdeling bestaat uit 20 gemotiveerde medewerkers die zich elke dag inzetten om de business te verbeteren, waarbij het zwaartepunt van de Business Analist op de business unit Meten ligt. Door de brede vraag van deze unit is er tussen verschillende product-teams veel uitwisseling van kennis en uitvoering van de werkzaamheden. Dit maakt ons een divers, betrokken en gezellige afdeling.

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én wordt jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)
* Python (Pyspark is een pré) en SQL

**Fijne pre's:**

* Kennis van Audit
* Kennis van Fabric

* Als Cloud engineer bij de gemeente Amsterdam draag je bij aan de verdere ontwikkeling van een innovatieve, duurzame en digitaal gestuurde stad.
* Je speelt een cruciale rol in het beheren en optimaliseren van ons dataplatform en maakt zo directe impact op het leven van Amsterdammers.

**De functie**
--------------


Amsterdam digitaliseert steeds verder, en onze ambities zijn hierin groot. Want wij kunnen immers met behulp van technologie het leven in onze stad verbeteren en gemakkelijker maken. Zo lossen wij stedelijke uitdagingen op die direct impact hebben op onze inwoners. Denk daarbij bij voorbeeld aan het inzetten van data bij grote Amsterdamse opgaven, zoals de overgang van aardgas naar alternatieve brandstoffen, de toenemende drukte in de stad of bij de armoedebestrijding. Maar ook het toegankelijker maken van onze diensten voor burgers, bezoekers, onze collega’s of ondernemers. Als onze nieuwe cloud engineer sta je hier midden in en werk je mee aan projecten met een grote maatschappelijke impact vanuit een team dat zich inzet voor een betere en duurzamere Amsterdam.



Bij de gemeente Amsterdam werken we aan aan een betere stad voor iedereen. Als cloud engineer versterk je onze vakgroep softwareontwikkeling, die bestaat uit 120 professionals. Hier werken we met verschillende teams, bestaande uit onder andere cloud engineers, softwareontwikkelaars, datascientists en product owners. Dit realiseren we met ontwikkelteams die ieder hun eigen producten ontwikkelen en beheren, in dit geval team AI & Data Analytics (AIDA) dat werkt aan digitale oplossingen voor de onderzoekers van de stad. Ons dataplatform bouwt aan duurzame oplossingen voor onze burgers en medewerkers in de Azure Cloud. We werken aan vooruitstrevende projecten in de stad, en denken na over hoe we AI en andere diensten in de cloud op een ethische, groene en efficiënte manier inzetten - zodat ons werk de hele stad en haar burgers ten goede komt.



Als onze nieuwe cloud engineer help je mee aan uiteenlopende uitdagingen en projecten. Momenteel werken we oa aan een project gericht op ChatGPT voor gemeentemedewerkers. Daarbij ontwikkelt het team een op ChatGPT-gebaseerde chatbot die medewerkers helpt bij het beantwoorden van vragen en het vinden van informatie binnen onze systemen. Ook werken we aan een platform voor Postgres/PowerBI/AML, waarbij we verschillende diensten in Azure leveren, denk aan een postgres database, Azure Machine Learning, en PowerBI omop een slimme, veilige en snelle manier data te visualiseren, te verwerken en op te slaan. Of werken we aan een hackathon: hoe host je een groene ChatGPT-achtige applicatie? We weten wat de ecologische voetafdruk is van software en applicaties die in de cloud worden gehost en verminderen waar dat kan. Daarom heeft het team de Amsterdam Eco Challenge georganiseerd: een hackathon met de focus op het ontwikkelen van een duurzame applicatie in de Azure cloud.


Dit doe je op een gemiddelde dag
--------------------------------

* Samen sta je sterker: je start je dag vaak met een stand-up meeting waarin je samen met je team de voortgang bespreekt en taken voor de dag verdeelt. Zo werk je werkt nauw samen met datascientists, data-engineers en het cloud team
* Ontwerpen en beheren van cloud-infrastructuur: vervolgens werk je aan het maken van een ARM template om resources te deployen in onze Azure omgeving. Je bent voortdurend bezig met het automatiseren van platformwerkzaamheden door middel van Infrastructure as Code (IaC) en CI/CD-pipelines.
* Beveiliging en naleving: je hebt een meeting met Risk over het waarborgen van de beveiliging van onze systemen en het naleven van regelgeving - een belangrijk onderdeel van je werk. Je zorgt er zo voor dat onze cloud-infrastructuur voldoet aan de hoogste veiligheidsstandaarden en werkt volgens de DevSecOps-principes.
* Continu leren en ontwikkelen: In de middag kies je een onderwerp om meer over te leren, om zo nieuwe vaardigheden en technologieën te verkennen. Elke sprint krijg je een dagdeel om te besteden aan training of het bijwonen van een workshop, zodat je altijd op de hoogte blijft van de nieuwste ontwikkelingen.


Hier ga je aan de slag
----------------------

We willen een goede werkgever zijn die ervoor zorgt dat alle collega’s zich gezien en gewaardeerd voelen. We koesteren verschillen tussen collega’s, al die verschillen zorgen voor betere resultaten voor onze organisatie én onze stad. We streven daarbij naar een personeelsbestand dat een afspiegeling is van de beroepsbevolking van Amsterdam. Dus wie jij ook bent: bij ons ben je van harte welkom!

**Digitalisering bij gemeente Amsterdam**


Amsterdam is een unieke stad. Aantrekkelijk om te wonen, werken en studeren en toonaangevend als dynamische internationale metropool. Tegelijkertijd staat de stad voor een grote uitdaging. De snelle verandering van onze samenleving leidt tot nieuwe opgaven voor de stad. Vaak hebben die opgaven digitaliseringsvraagstukken waarvoor softwareontwikkeling nodig is. De stad werkt opgavegericht met multidisciplinaire (DevOps) ontwikkelteams. Deze teams werken aan algemene voorzieningen zoals een dataplatform, App framework en componenten bibliotheek. Maar ook aan applicaties die collega’s en burgers ondersteunen. De applicaties die jij ontwikkelt hebben een groot bereik en maatschappelijke impact op de stad.

**Vakgroep Softwareontwikkeling**


De vakgroep softwareontwikkeling bestaat uit 120 professionals en levert mensen en kennis aan ontwikkelteams in de stad. De vakgroep zorgt voor ontwikkelstandaarden, stimuleert samenwerking middels gildes en faciliteert hergebruik van code middels generieke componenten.

* Solid understanding of statistical concepts and methodologies.
* Detail-oriented with strong organizational and multitasking abilities.
* Experience with dbt and Google Cloud is a plus

  

On the less technical side we expect that you:

**What you'll be doing day to day**  

  

You will conduct advanced data exploration and analyses that deliver insights, which support and enable data-driven decision-making for our Buyback service. Our vision is to transform into a circular business by 2030, through developing customer facing circular services for the many. Currently we have two services in our portfolio: Buyback & Resell and As-Is Online. And we are launching two new services this fiscal year: IKEA Preloved (a marketplace) and a Repair Hub. Exciting times ahead!  

  

**Our team within Ikea**  

  

You are part of the Data & Machine Learning team together with other Data Analysts and Data Engineers (and potentially Data Scientists and ML Engineers in the future). Together, you join cross-functional product teams consisting of colleagues from Engineering, Product and Design (PEDX), to design, implement and deploy products at scale. Your job is a mix of understanding business needs, designing data solutions – and of course writing code.  

  

This role is based in Amsterdam, in our Digital hub that is housing up to 500 co-workers, located in the harbour area north-west of the city centre.  

We see so many opportunities for what we can accomplish and have the ambition to be a world class team. At the same time, we believe that our work is not just about solving business problems, but also about learning and having fun together.  

  

WE CAN OFFER YOU  

* Work on some exciting problems as described above. Moreover, you are encouraged to spot new opportunities or to collaborate with Data & Machine Learning colleagues in other specialist teams.
* Opportunities to have global impact with your work, both for people and planet.
* Flexible and modern tools: we deploy on Google Cloud Platform, and we use a lot of open-source tools across the board.
* Hardware and OS of your choice.
* A team of great colleagues to learn with and from (with world-class experience across all aspects of Data Analytics).
* Continuous learning (we aim to spend 20% of our working time on learning).
* Flexible and friendly working environment.

  

**Questions and support? Let's connect!**  

  

Does this sound like your next challenge? IKEA offers an exciting and empowering work environment in a global workplace. And as the world’s leader in life at home, you have exceptional opportunities to grow and develop together with us.

Binnen Liander is een programma “**Integrale sturing**” gestart met als doel om op langer termijn meer productie te kunnen maken. Dit is nodig gezien de hoeveelheid werk wat op Liander afkomt. Integrale sturing kijkt hierin niet alleen naar welke werk op welk moment uitgevoerd moet worden, maar ook naar belangen van o.a. de maatschappij en van haar medewerkers. Binnen dit programma is een applicatie ontwikkelt “WorkBeat” met een algoritme en optimizer die al deze belangen meeneemt, afweegt en optimaliseert in een uiteindelijke planning.


Dit algoritme moet steeds worden uitgebreid en worden verfijnd. Daar ben jij als Senior Data Scientist samen met je collega data scientists verantwoordelijk voor. Hierin zal de business haar wensen aangegeven in de vorm van een “use case” en jij zal dit moeten vertalen naar het algoritme. Hierin zal je veel moeten schakelen op alle niveaus binnen de organisatie en dit vertalen in userstory’s die de data scientists kunnen oppakken. Het team waar jullie onderdeel van maken is een digitaliseringsteam bestaande uit meerder rollen en disciplines. Denk aan veranderconsultants, software engineers, business analisten solution architecten, enz.


Je behoort tot de top van Nederland op het gebied van data science. Je bent communicatief sterk, aangezien je dagelijks zelfstandig gesprekken voert met stakeholders om de resultaten van analyses uit te leggen. Binnen een agile omgeving, werkend in scrumteams, ben je flexibel en reageer je snel op veranderende eisen. Concrete voorbeelden zijn onder andere het identificeren en oplossen van problemen met modellen, het toepassen van geavanceerde statistische methoden en het begrijpen en vertalen van de behoeften van stakeholders naar effectieve data science oplossingen. Het energienet van de toekomst maken we voor iedereen, mét iedereen. En als Senior Data Scientist werk jij hieraan mee. Zo ben jij bezig met het:

* het ontwerpen, ontwikkelen en bijdragen aan de implementatie van modellen en algoritmes om complexe optimalisatie problemen binnen een operationele omgeving op te lossen. Je gebruikt hierbij operations research, statistiek en machine learning.
* algoritmisch werken met complexe optimalisatiemethoden, waaronder Mixed Integer Programming.
* effectief communiceren met stakeholders, zelfstandig voeren van gesprekken en opereren binnen een agile omgeving.
* begeleiden van minder ervaren data scientists om hen te ondersteunen en professioneel te laten ontwikkelen in het vak.

**Jij maakt het net completer bij Alliander**

**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Jij bent degene die vooropgaat in onze opgave om zowel op organisatorisch, technisch, ethisch als juridisch vlak de stappen te zetten op het gebied van harmonisering en implementeren. De urgentie en ambitie zijn groot en het meekrijgen van collega’s is jou op het lijf geschreven. Dit doe je niet alleen. Als operationeel specialist Data stuur je een klein en enthousiast team van data deskundigen aan van de Afdeling Business Intelligence & Kwaliteit (BI&K). Samen met hen en in nauwe en actieve verbinding met collega’s in vergelijkbare functies vanuit de eigen eenheid en de andere regionale en landelijke intelligence afdelingen werk je aan deze mooi opdracht, onder andere door het ontwikkelen van visie op het datagedreven werken.


Daarnaast weet jij te anticiperen op de continue veranderende behoefte en belangen van onze interne en externe partners. Dat maakt dat prioriteren en het maken van keuzes een belangrijk onderdeel zijn van je werk. We verwachten hierbij dat je vooruitkijkt en in staat bent het effect op de langere termijn in te schatten. Maar ook oog hebt voor de collega’s van BI&K en de doelstellingen van onze partners. Belangrijk hierbij is dat je je onderdeel voelt van de intelligence organisatie.


De intelligence organisatie moet ethische grenzen, voortkomend uit maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen vertalen naar praktische toepassingen en voldoen aan wet- en regelgeving. Data wordt verzameld, opgeslagen, geanalyseerd, technisch ingericht en beheerd om deze vervolgens beschikbaar te stellen aan de gebruikers. Als operationeel specialist werk jij aan het doel van onze dienst: richtinggevend zijn in intelligence gestuurde politie. Je bent hierin de sparringpartner van het sectorhoofd DRIO en de teamchef van de Afdeling Analyse & Onderzoek.


Je hebt aanvullende taken binnen de DRIO en je kunt gevraagd worden om deel te nemen aan een Staf Grootschalig en Bijzonder Optreden (SGBO). Dit betekent dat piketdiensten bij de functie horen. Als de operatie daarom vraagt, ben je flexibel ten aanzien van je werktijden.


**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


De DRIO Midden-Nederland is een dynamische dienst die bestaat uit meer dan 350 medewerkers die 24/7 de politieorganisatie en haar partners voorzien van actuele intelligence. Binnen de DRIO Midden-Nederland vertrouwen we op de kennis van onze specialisten en krijg je de ruimte om te zijn wie je bent. De verschillende teams dragen op hun eigen wijze, met eigen middelen, bronnen en specifieke kennis bij aan actuele intelligence. Met deze bijdragen wil de DRIO richtinggevend zijn bij zowel veiligheidsvraagstukken als in opsporingsonderzoeken.


Om dit doel te bereiken zijn verschillende collega’s werkzaam binnen deze dataopgave, waaronder de Afdeling BI&K. Seze afdeling bestaat uit het Team Business Intelligence Competence Centre (BICC) en het Team Kwaliteit van Informatie (KvI). Vanuit jouw expertise werk je mee aan de dataopgave en geef je sturing aan de specialisten binnen deze afdeling, zoals de Cognos ontwikkelaars, business analisten, de data scientists en de adviseur datakwaliteit. De afdeling bestaat momenteel uit 7 fte, maar de wens is om dit in de toekomst uit te breiden. De afdeling is volop in ontwikkeling! Daarnaast werk je nauw samen met het Team Rendement Operationele Informatie (TROI). TROI is een klein en wendbaar team, opgericht vanuit de opsporing en intelligence, dat midden in de operatie staat en apps bouwt waarmee data eenvoudig geanalyseerd kan worden.


**Wie ben jij?**
----------------

Jij bent een specialist data die nieuwe en actuele kennis en inzichten met zich meebrengt en deze weet toe te passen in de context van het politiewerk. Dat vraagt om intensieve samenwerking, creativiteit en overtuigingskracht. Je hebt ervaring met het leidinggeven aan kleine en specialistische teams en je weet met jouw coachende leiderschapsstijl collega’s te inspireren en hun vaardigheden naar een hoger niveau te tillen.


Analytisch ben je sterk, je onderscheidt gemakkelijk hoofd- van bijzaken en brengt informatie uit diverse databronnen met elkaar in verband. Je bent ondernemend, leergierig en nieuwsgierig; je signaleert kansen en bent alert op trends en maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen. Daarnaast zoeken wij een teamspeler die hoge eisen stelt aan het werk en voortdurend op zoek is naar mogelijkheden om de kwaliteit te verbeteren. Je neemt initiatief en denkt in creatieve mogelijkheden zowel op de korte termijn als ook wat ons de komende jaren te wachten staat op het gebied van data. Tot slot beschik jij over het vermogen om daadwerkelijk zaken te organiseren en te implementeren. Spreekt je dit aan, dan zien we je sollicitatie graag tegemoet.

-------------------


  
Hoeveel kinkhoest, mazelen of COVID-19 besmettingen zijn er op dit moment in Nederland? Met jouw data skills help jij mee aan het beantwoorden van deze vragen. Hoe je het ook wendt of keert, werken bij het RIVM is een impactvolle baan.



Wat ga je doen



Als data scientist richt je je op het (adviseren over het) automatiseren van surveillance pipelines binnen het centrum Epidemiologie en Surveillance van Infectieziekten (EPI). Daarbij hoort het scripten van de data transformatie en het vertalen van data naar inzichtelijke outputs volgens de door het team ontwikkelde standaarden. De hiervoor gebruikte surveillance data zijn afkomstig uit verschillende databronnen, bijvoorbeeld meldingen gedaan door de GGD'en, NICE intensive care, ziekenhuis data, Infectieradar en data van de huisartsen peilstations. Een voorbeeld van de output van een geautomatiseerde surveillance pipeline die gebruikt maakt van meerdere van bovenstaande bronnen is griep, kijk op deze website hoe dit eruitziet: https://www.rivm.nl/griep-griepprik/feiten-en-cijfers.



Eén dag per week adviseer je collega’s over het bouwen van hun eigen surveillance pipelines. Een aantal dagen per maand ben je het aanspreekpunt voor technische vragen over de pipelines die binnen het centrum voor surveillance doeleinden worden gebruikt. Op andere dagen ben je zelf bezig met het bouwen en het beheer van pipelines en dashboards en draag je bij aan het efficiënter maken van de pipelines en rapportages. Je bent onderdeel van een gedreven team en levert direct een bijdrage aan het inzichtelijk maken van de beschikbare gegevens.



Verantwoordelijkheden:


* Efficiënte en correcte scripts.
* Ophalen van vraagstukken en deze correct en tijdig beantwoorden.
* Technisch ondersteunen van de epidemiologen.
* Tijdige oplevering rapportages, dashboards en andere outputs.


Uniek aan deze baan



De aard van de werkzaamheden vertoont een innovatief karakter, waardoor er volop gelegenheid is om kennis en expertise op te bouwen op het gebied van R en datastromen. Je neemt deel aan diverse projecten en processen, waarbij de nadruk ligt op het creëren van maatschappelijke relevantie via geavanceerde data science-methoden voor de surveillance van infectieziekten.



Afdeling



Vanuit de afdeling Data, Innovatie en Signalering (DIS) ondersteunen we met 30 medewerkers de rest van het centrum EPI op het gebied van datamanagement en BI, data science en privacy compliance. In totaal werken bij de afdeling DIS meer dan 25 data specialisten - waarvan negen bij het data science team - aan het gereed maken van surveillance data van onder andere de infectieziekten COVID-19, influenza en MPOX.



DIS heeft binnen EPI een centrale rol bij het standaardiseren van de surveillance datastromen van infectieziektes. Veel handmatige en (soms) ad hoc processen worden nu omgezet in gestandaardiseerde en geautomatiseerde processen. Het team werkt aan het (nog) efficiënter inrichten van deze standaarden en aan verdere uitrol binnen EPI. Het team geeft hiervoor advies aan collega’s over het bouwen van hun eigen surveillance pipelines. Het team vertaalt in overleg met epidemiologen deze gegevens naar inzichtelijke tabellen, grafieken, kaarten en rapporten. Deze worden gebruikt als basis voor regionaal, landelijk of internationaal beleid ten aanzien van de bestrijding van infectieziektes. Het team werkt in R (met Tidyverse) voor data pipelines, met GitLab voor version control, met R Markdown voor automatische rapportages en R Shiny voor dashboards.



Daarnaast wordt door middel van text mining data inzichtelijk gemaakt welke de epidemiologen kunnen gebruiken voor het surveillance proces. Op dit moment wordt er met (gen)AI verkent hoe deze technologie kan bijdragen aan onze werkzaamheden. Het team werkt binnen het centrum nauw samen met een team van epidemiologen, datamanagers en onderzoekers en daarbuiten ook met andere (data science) experts van de ICT-organisatie.



De werksfeer binnen ons team is open, vriendelijk, gedreven en nieuwsgierig. Iedereen is druk bezig met uiteenlopende projecten, maar staat toch open voor vragen en springt bij als dit nodig is. Jouw collega’s zijn over het algemeen zeer leergierig; innovatie en nieuwe ideeën worden aangemoedigd. Doordat er binnen dit team niet alleen softwareontwikkeling plaatsvindt, maar ook support en trainingen worden gegeven aan epidemiologen, is het team ook sociaal sterk verbonden met de andere afdelingen. Een goede, ontspannen werksfeer wordt bevorderd door een dagelijkse lunchwandeling in het bos, werkuitjes en borrels. Naast de werkdagen op kantoor (minimaal 2 dagen per week) is er ook ruimte om vanuit huis te werken en zo de privé-werk balans optimaal in te richten.



Interesse



Wil jij hieraan meewerken in de functie van data scientist? Stuur dan je sollicitatie aan Martijn van Rooijen, afdelingshoofd data, innovatie en signalering. Heb je eerst nog vragen over deze vacature, dan kan je Stijn Andeweg bereiken op 06-29651369.

***Challenge: How does (nourished) sand move around at a recently nourished beach?***


***Change: Unravel the hydrodynamics and sediment pathways at a beach.***


***Impact: Safer, climate-robust coasts and deltas.***


Job description


The department of Hydraulic Engineering (Civil Engineering and Geosciences) is looking for a PhD candidate as part of the large SOURCE research project. SOURCE stands for Sand nourishment strategies for sustainable Coastal Ecosystems. The SOURCE philosophy is that carefully planned sand nourishments now will create the required and desired resilient and dynamic multifunctional coastal landscapes of the future.



Sand nourishment has been essential in the Dutch government’s strategy to sustainably maintain flood protection levels along the Dutch coast for more than 30 years. Nourishment volumes are projected to increase to keep up with the expected acceleration in sea level rise. Currently, however, there is a lack of fundamental knowledge on how the nourished sand finds its way through the coastal system, and what the long-term, cumulative effects are for the coast as an ecosystem. For instance, we know that beaches that are nourished with sand in the nearshore are eroding less, but which sediment is accumulating on the landward beach is still unknown. Likewise it is still unknown which hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes dominate in the vicinity of a nourishment.



In its entirety, the SOURCE research team will deliver the scientific knowledge, models and design tools to develop and evaluate nourishment strategies in a multi-stakeholder co-creation process. Our Living Labs are two sand nourishments along the Dutch coast. These will be co-designed, monitored and evaluated by the SOURCE consortium (in particular the 12 PhD and postdoc researchers at 8 academic institutes in total) in collaboration with 25 partners from government organizations, research institutes, nature organizations and industry.



Position at Delft University of Technology:



As part of the SOURCE project, the PhD candidate at Delft University of Technology will examine the morphological development of shoreface nourishments. Understanding the hydrodynamics and sediment transport are key in this research. You will therefore use state-of-the-art field equipment and strategic numerical modelling to unravel the physical processes shaping nourishments. This will ultimately contribute to the robustness of (Dutch) sandy coasts to climate change and the safety of its people against flood hazards.



You will:



* Plan, execute and analyse field observations at a nourished beach to better understand the impact of nourishments on the hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and morphological evolution.


* Use strategic modelling to predict coastal sediment pathways at recently nourished beaches and the origin of sediment accumulated in the lee side.


* Combine data and findings of multiple nourishment projects to show the link between engineering design and coastal settings on the nourishment performance. This step will require you to collaborate with government and industry partners (abroad).


* Collaborate with academic partners in the SOURCE project to translate quantitative metrics of physical beach response to ecological and socio-economic impacts.



At TU Delft, you will be part of the Coastal Engineering section where we combine research on hydrodynamics, morphodynamics, and human interventions to the coast using numerical modelling and field measurements. You will primarily work with Matthieu de Schipper and Stuart Pearson, embedded within a larger ecosystem of research partners.


Requirements


Required conditions are:


* Master of Science (MSc) in a relevant field, e.g. Civil or Environmental Engineering, Earth Science, Physics, Physical Geography.
* Excellent communication skills (written and oral), including proficiency in English. Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.


In addition:


* You have demonstrated an affinity for and a strong interest in doing fieldwork and numerical modelling, coding (Matlab or Python), data analysis, and critical thinking
* You follow your curiosity and enjoy cross-pollinating different research fields, e.g. sediment dynamics, numerical modelling and biogeomorpological interactions. Enjoy a long day of working on the beach!
* You work well in teams, supporting and leading your colleagues and MSc/BSc students, and demonstrate inclusive values towards building a diverse research community.
* You are enthusiastic to share your ideas and findings via scientific papers, presentations at (inter)national conferences and where possible with a wider public.
* You like to finish what you start, and can balance perfectionism with pragmatism.


Conditions of employment


Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.



Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2770 per month in the first year to € 3539 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor.

Als Senior consultant Strategic AI implementeer je niet alleen AI-oplossingen bij onze klanten, je speelt ook een centrale rol in het ontwikkelen van AI-strategieën. Bij ons draait alles om het begrijpen van wat onze klanten nodig hebben, hoe hun organisatie werkt en welke technologieën beschikbaar zijn. We duiken diep in de doelen van de klant, hun huidige processen en IT-systemen, de nieuwste technologische ontwikkelingen en we trekken conclusies over hoe AI kan helpen. Maar daar blijft het niet bij. We geloven in de kracht van samenwerking. Daarom werk je nauw samen met de klant en Highberg-collega's uit diverse expertisegebieden zoals datagovernance, verandermanagement, architectuur, security en privacy om impact te maken en daadwerkelijk verandering te realiseren.

* Het leiden van onze klanten door hun digitale transformatie, met een specifieke focus op AI. Dit vereist nauwe samenwerking met verschillende afdelingen binnen de organisatie om een geïntegreerde aanpak te garanderen.

**Wat is onze visie op AI?**

Naar onze mening speelt AI een centrale rol bij digitale transformaties. We zijn ons ervan bewust dat, ondanks de schijnbaar eindeloze mogelijkheden van deze technologie, de praktische implementatie ervan en binnen bestaande IT-systemen complex is. Daarom zetten we ons in om onze klanten te ondersteunen bij het vertalen van AI-mogelijkheden naar praktische en werkbare oplossingen. Ons werk omvat een breed scala aan toepassingen, van machine learning en data-analyse tot automatisering en het ontwikkelen van intelligente besluitvormingssystemen, al dan niet op basis van generatieve AI. Wat ons uniek maakt, is dat we onafhankelijk zijn. We geven altijd advies dat het beste is voor onze klant, zonder vooraf voorkeur te hebben voor een specifieke leverancier of product.

* Minimaal 5 jaar relevante werkervaring als adviseur, expert en/of projectleider op het vakgebied van data & AI;

* Iemand met commercieel inzicht, analytische vaardigheden en een proactieve aanpak in relatiebeheer, netwerken en offertetrajecten.

* Oprechte aandacht voor persoonlijke ontwikkeling waaronder coaching door collega’s, toegang toe en breed opleidings- en trainingsaanbod en een persoonlijk ontwikkelplan met bijpassende investeringen;

* Een prettige werkomgeving met een prettig en goed bereikbaar kantoor, focus op prestaties als team en niet op het individu en tal van sociale activiteiten zoals borrels, sportactiviteiten en teamsamenkomsten.

**Over het team**

Bij Highberg zijn we proactief, positief en werken we graag samen. In teams van mensen met diverse achtergronden en senioriteit ga je aan de slag met complexe datavraagstukken. De expertisegroep Data & AI bestaat uit zo’n 25 consultants, met een goede mix van ervaring en energie. We richten ons op de thema’s datagedreven werken, datamanagement/-governance, data regulering en AI. Naast projecten doen we op deze thema’s in wisselende samenstelling actief aan kennis- en marktontwikkeling. Zo helpen wij elkaar nieuwe dingen leren en het beste uit onszelf te halen. Daarnaast hebben we maandelijks een overleg met de groep, waarin we inhoudelijk een thema bij de kop pakken maar vooral ook gezellig met elkaar eten en borrelen. Zo leren we de persoon achter de consultant kennen, wat versterkt wordt door de borrels en bijeenkomsten die in (Jong) Highberg-verband worden georganiseerd. Dit maakt Highberg de thuisbasis waarin je het beste uit jezelf haalt als consultant en als persoon.

-------------------


Rapid advances in sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) hold the promise of enhancing human capacities and prolonging well-being as we age. Philosophers are increasingly viewing human well-being as the exercise of various capacities, some of which significantly change during senescence. Cutting-edge augmentation technologies have the potential to replace or improve many deteriorating capabilities, enabling us to maintain physical abilities (e.g., exoskeletons) and cognitive health (e.g., brain-computer interfaces). Such technologies increase our ability to live independently for longer, while also boosting our overall quality of life. Nevertheless, technological advances of augmentation technologies simultaneously disrupt long-held normative notions about *how human capabilities are connected to the good life* (Nussbaum 2020, 2011) and *how to view senescence* (Sen 1993). This has direct implications for the design of technologies that seek to augment our capabilities, especially when such augmentation technologies aim to replace capabilities later in life.


Scientific progress on the question of how to enhance age-dependent capabilities is hampered by a widening gap between 1) the power of STEM-based technologies to enhance a wide range of human capabilities, and 2) normative accounts of well-being, specifically ethical theories that link the ability to exercise a full range of capabilities to living well (Jacobs 2020). The PhD researcher will join an interdisciplinary team aiming to unite the practices of STEM disciplines that make augmentation *technologically possible* with philosophical insights that shed light on which augmentation technologies are *ethically desirable* for improving life quality. This stands to significantly improve the future design of end-of-life technologies, especially technologies that explicitly connect the exercise of human capabilities to well-being in later life.


By uniting STEM and ethical approaches to the future design of augmentation technologies, the holder of this PhD position will have the following key deliverables:


* Developing a generalisable approach to how STEM subjects and normative (ethical, legal) disciplines work together, emphasising how STEM practitioners can actively co-design normative frameworks. To do this, the candidate will develop methods that foster a productive dialogue between STEM and ethical disciplines, exploring generalizable approaches – possibly moving beyond ethics guidelines – for the collaborative integration of technological and normative practices.


* Unpack cultural and conceptual differences to create new approaches to interdisciplinary confrontation. Potentially, share these with affiliated research programmes that also seek to do multi- and/or trans-disciplinary research (e.g., Hybrid Intelligence, SIENNA).


* Show how a framework that emphasises preserving human capabilities & extending well-being can be useful in the ethical evaluation of other socially disruptive technologies.



**Funding & Institutional Embedding**


This PhD position is funded by the *Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies* (ESDiT). It will be hosted by Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), primarily by the Human-Technology Interaction Group, but also by the Philosophy & Ethics Group. The PhD will participate in the activities of these groups, as well as the recently launched, Expertise Centre Dementia & Technology.


Please note that there are other vacancies funded by the ESDiT programme that are currently advertised. In case several of these are of interest to you, we encourage you to apply to them simultaneously.


**The ESDiT Programme**


The *Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies* programme is a ten-year international research programme of seven academic institutions in the Netherlands, which started in January 2020. This programme has a combined budget of € 27 million and is funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research in the Gravitation funding scheme for excellent research, and by matching funds from the participating institutions. The duration is from January 2020 to December 2029. The programme has the aim of achieving breakthrough research in at the intersection of ethics, philosophy, technology / engineering and social sciences, and to position its consortium at the top of its field internationally. A key objective is to investigate how new technologies challenge moral values and ontological concepts (like “nature”, “human being” and “community”), and how these challenges necessitate a revision of these concepts. Within ESDiT, this project will be embedded in the Human Condition Line and the STEM track. A fuller description of the Human Condition Line and the STEM track, as well as the programme as a whole, can be found on the ESDiT website: https://www.esdit.nl/


**Human-Technology Interaction Group**


The Human-Technology Interaction (HTI) group analyses human interactions with technology with the aim to better understand and improve the match between technology and its users. HTI combines expertise from areas of social sciences (mainly cognitive and social psychology and perception) with engineering. The group’s lab facilities offer opportunities to study virtual reality, auditory perception, gaming, lighting, and general psychological lab resources. The group’s research centers around five main areas: human-computer interaction and affective computing, decision-making and human-data interaction, social psychology and persuasion, contextual environmental psychology, and human perception and cognition. HTI takes part in multiple collaborations and multidisciplinary research. More information about HTI can be found here.


**Philosophy & Ethics Group**

TU/e’s Philosophy and Ethics (P&E) group connects philosophy and ethics to emerging technologies and innovation. Researchers in the P&E group primarily study innovative technologies and technology-related problems in detail to enable empirically informed analyses that are meaningful to philosophers, researchers across disciplines, and other societal stakeholders. To do this, the group has established close interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers from groups in the TU/e School of Innovation Sciences, as well as with mechanical engineers, climate scientists, and archaeologists, among others. The group’s expertise covers a variety of philosophical sub-disciplines, including applied ethics, normative ethics, meta-ethics, philosophy of science and technology, and epistemology. More information about P&E can be found here.


**Expertise Centre Dementia & Technology**

The ECDT collaborates with Alzheimer Nederland and TU Eindhoven, aiming to contribute to changing the approach to dementia in society. The technology developed and implemented is referred to as “Warme Technologie” (Warm Technology), as it involves continuous collaboration with individuals with dementia and their caregivers, following the principle: “Nothing about us, without us”. Existing assistive technology is still too often developed for the elderly instead of with the elderly. And too often, the technology, such as interactive screens and sensors, is the focus instead of the needs, wishes, and possibilities of the target group. At ECDT, researchers work with healthcare organizations, caregivers, nurses, companies, designers, and others. Together, we develop warm technology that is user-friendly and non-stigmatizing and aims to improve the quality of life and well-being of people with dementia. More information about ECDT and warm technology can be found here.

Job description


Economic resources (e.g. wealth and income) are distributed unevenly among people and in space: within cities and between cities, people and resources are concentrated and segregated. Economic inequality and urban segregation are considered top priority challenges by the United Nations. Tackling them is urgent because economic inequality and urban segregation restrict the ability of the poorest individuals to get by in life, but they also affect life expectancy, social justice and cohesion for everyone.



One way to understand and address urban economic segregation is to model its dynamics, and to run and compare policy scenarios on how to reduce it. Following recent developments in analytical sociology and computational social sciences, generative modelling (such as Agent-based modelling) has proven valuable to implement, combine and test causal theories through mechanistic representation. By showing how urban economic segregation persists and evolves due to individual interactions in space, we aim to advance our understanding of the interplay between economic inequality and residential segregation and to better assess possible remediatory policies.



This doctoral position represents an exciting opportunity to combine and develop the latest methods of modular social simulation, empirically-calibrated agent-based models and spatially explicit population synthesis on a socially relevant topic. You will be expected to 1/Build a synthetic population from sociodemographic and spatial microdata ; 2/ Build a modular Agent-based model of urban economic segregation, that translates a set of identified theories into social mechanisms ; 3/Evaluate and calibrate the model configurations against sociodemographic and spatial microdata ; 4/ Implement, run and compare policy scenarios on the calibrated model ; 5/ Write, submit and present related articles to relevant journals and conferences.



This research programme should lead to two areas of innovation. First, you will advance research on urban economic segregation by providing a theoretically grounded and empirically calibrated agent based model on which to test policy scenarios. Second, you will participate in on-going methodological research on spatially explicit synthetic populations and modular model building (including reusable building blocks) in the field of social simulation. Please apply if you think these challenges are exciting opportunities for you to grow as a computational social scientist.



In order to meet the challenges of this doctoral project, you should have experience in the fields of spatially-explicit social simulation, model evaluation and population synthesis. social science and spatial sciences. The successful candidate will be funded by the ERC Starting Grant SEGUE and will work in close collaboration with its members: a PhD student, a postdoctoral researcher and the Principal Investigator Dr. Clémentine Cottineau. You will find support within the Urban Studies section of the Urbanism Department of the faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment – a recognised centre of expertise in working on urban inequality with longitudinal microdata –, and link up with the Multi-actor systems group at the TPM faculty of TU Delft.


Requirements


Need to have:


* Completed Masters degree in computational social science, analytical sociology, complex systems science, urban studies, spatial economics, social statistics, economic geography or other relevant fields linked to agent-based modelling and spatially orientated quantitative social science;
* Knowledge and experience in agent-based modelling (model building, analysis, evaluation);
* Knowledge and experience with population synthesis;
* Knowledge and experience with object oriented programming;
* Interest in multidisciplinarity research;
* Ability to handle and combine the abstract concepts and theories of inequality and segregation;
* Ability to work in a team, take initiative, be creative;
* Good command of verbal and written English.


Nice to have:


* Experience of linking agent based models with large empirical data;

***Interested in working on autonomous robots for the real, open world in a multidisciplinary team and also doing a PhD? Join us!***


Job description


You will work within the OpenBots laboratory creating autonomous robots that operate in the real world with various other PhDs and engineers. The OpenBots laboratory aims to develop a common sense capability for robots making them able to understand their surroundings and plan proper actions to execute their inspection task, even when part of their surrounding world is unknown and dynamic. The inspection task deals with a robot walking around a perimeter and, meanwhile, detecting abnormal events based on vision or sound, after which a detailed investigation of the siutation might be required. The common sense capabililty that we develop shall allow the robot to complete similar inspection tasks in different (potentially changing) environments, such as governmental buildings, industrial plants, or train tracks. Our developments shall follow the latest achievements in artificial intelligence, world modelling, knowledge representations, mission planning and motion planning, where each team member has its own specialization.



Your research will be related to world modelling and knowledge representation, i.e., creating the robot's situational awareness, assuming that it is able to detect and observe individual objects and events through its camera and microphone. More specifically, you will study and develop algorithms for managing the robot's information based on these observations and based on a predefined, or learned, knowledge structure. Since our robots will operate in the real, open world, incoming information will be corrupted by noise and mistakes. Therefore, it is important that information is managed by combining evidences related to the observations with logic and symbolic reasoning, like a Bayesian network or Markov logic networks. However, to cope with the unknowns it might be essential to replace Bayes' principles with, for example, possiblity theory. In addition, we expect to develop deductive reasoning so that when the robot encounters an unknown situation it may rely on general knowledge/models, and plan experiments to either accept or falsify the application of such knowledge/models to the unknown situation. Finally, you will also study and develop algorithms that extract a situational graph representing the current situation of the robot, or its near-future. Situational graphs shall be used for task planning of the robot and should thus contain which task can be carried our where, for example through inductive reasoning on the available information along with patterns in such information that may be linked to a task-capability of the robot.



The OpenBots project is being carried out in a team of 5 PhD students, 3 at the Delft University of Technology (where this vacancy is one of such PhDs) and 2 at the University of Amsterdam. You will work 3 days a week at the university and the other 2 days you will work with all other 5 PhDs at one of the external partners being TNO and the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee where a physical lab environment is available. The project is carried out with supervisors from the Cognitive Robotics Group of the Delft University of Technology (Dr. J. Sijs, Dr. C. Hernandez Corbato and Prof. J. Alonso-Mora) and the Video and Image Sense Lab of the University of Amsterdam (Prof. Cees Snoek).

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=86dd5697662c782f,indeed,PhD New Luminescent Materials for Sustainable Energy Technology: towards a photovoltaic window,TU Delft,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Tu-Delft,"Delft, ZH, NL",,2024-06-20,,,,,False,,,,"Functieomschrijving


In this PhD research project, luminescent materials for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) technology will be developed. The PhD will make and study new types of strongly absorbing luminescent solar absorber materials of just a few hundred nm thick, that can convert the UV+VIS part of the solar spectrum into infra-red luminescence. When applied as a coating to windows, these materials can enable a cost-effective electricity generating PV-window following the principle of a Luminescent Solar Concentrator (LSC). A LSC can harvest sunlight by absorbing, re-emitting, and subsequently guiding light, like in an optical fibre, to solar cells integrated in the windowpane that convert the light in electric power.

  



To successfully develop new valuable luminescent absorber materials, it is crucial to get fundamental understanding of the physical processes underlying the luminescence mechanism of the materials. One of the scientific challenges is to understand how generated electron-hole pairs can transfer their energy to the luminescence centres. The strongest possible absorptions in an inorganic material are so-called bandgap absorptions in which an electron is excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) leaving behind a hole in the VB. Although there are many materials (hosts) with a small bandgap that absorb the entire visible part of the solar spectrum (black materials), very few show efficient luminescence of doping ions. Host-to-doping ion energy transfer is often described by a resonant process between (self-trapped) exciton emission and doping ion absorption. The materials of this project have a smaller bandgap and are selected to have a small exciton binding energy causing transfer involving excitons to be inefficient. In the new materials, sequential transfer of first the electron followed by the hole is the anticipated transfer process to the luminescence centres.

  



The fundamental insights are obtained first by time and temperature resolved optical and luminescence spectroscopy combined with a variety of techniques to analyse the structure, (defect) composition and morphology of the films. Secondly fundamental understanding involves data interpretation and model development using knowledge of solid-state physics, optics and quantum mechanics. Ideally the obtained insights will be used to select other materials with improved properties during your project.

  



In this project you will learn the ins and outs of reactive DC, RF and pulsed magnetron sputtering, the working horse technology in glass coating industry, to make the luminescence materials. Targeted materials are rare earth (like Yb) and transition metal (like Mn) doped inorganic semiconducting materials, emitting in the infra-red spectral range, where silicon solar cells have high conversion efficiency.

  



The Luminescence Materials group at Delft University of Technology has more than 30 years of experience with luminescent materials research and collaborates with a start-up company and glass coating industry to facilitate a route to large scale application of the coatings as windows. You will be working in a team, headed by your promotor, with other PhD's, technicians, a start-up company and glass coating industry. A PhD student receives a general education by the University Graduate School and can be involved in activities like teaching practicals for a small part of your time and co-supervise graduation project at the bachelor and master level.

***Interested in working on autonomous robots for the real, open world in a multidisciplinary team and also doing a PhD? Join us!***


Job description


You will work within the OpenBots laboratory creating autonomous robots that operate in the real world with various other PhDs and engineers. The OpenBots laboratory aims to develop a common sense capability for robots making them able to understand their surroundings and plan proper actions to execute their inspection task, even when part of their surrounding world is unknown and dynamic. The inspection task deals with a robot walking around a perimeter and, meanwhile, detecting abnormal events based on vision or sound, after which a detailed investigation of the siutation might be required. The common sense capabililty that we develop shall allow the robot to complete similar inspection tasks in different (potentially changing) environments, such as governmental buildings, industrial plants, or train tracks. Our developments shall follow the latest achievements in artificial intelligence, world modelling, knowledge representations, mission planning and motion planning, where each team member has its own specialization.



Your research will be related to task and motion planning, assuming that the robot has an awareness about the situation it is currently in and about the situation that is desired. Therein, you will study and develop algorithms for planning the execution of the robot's inspection task. Planning is constrained by the policies that are enforced by a user, while execution is constrained by the physical characteristics of the environment, or terrain, and by the limitations of the robot's locomotion capabilities. Therefore, your research is expected to start from a graph representation describing the situation and the planning problem that needs to be solved, like a Markov decision process, after which some combination of logic reasoning, discrete optimization and machine learning results in a seemless execution in which the robot stays withing the bounderies set by the policy. Task execution may be aborted or adjusted in the case that obstacles need to be avoided, or new invesigation tasks emerge. Also, given the complexity and uncertainties of (unknown) events in the real world, your task and motion planning capability should exploit the experience of prior executions and learn how they may apply to in the current situation.



The OpenBots project is being carried out in a team of 5 PhD students, 3 at the Delft University of Technology (where this vacancy is one of such PhDs) and 2 at the University of Amsterdam. You will work 3 days a week at the university and the other 2 days you will work with all other 5 PhDs at one of the external partners being TNO and the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee where a physical lab environment is available. The project is carried out with supervisors from the Cognitive Robotics Group of the Delft University of Technology (Prof. J. Alonso-Mora , Dr. J. Sijs and Dr. C. Hernandez Corbato) and the Video and Image Sense Lab of the University of Amsterdam (Prof. Cees Snoek).

Join us as PhD candidate.


**Your job**
------------


In recent years, there has been a significant surge of interest in networks, which now play a fundamental role in modern science and society. The network-like structures are widely discussed, from cosmology and communication to economics and ecology. Even at the nanoscale, in materials science, they may offer potential theoretical explanations for material properties. Despite their popularity, the mathematical foundations underlying networks remain incompletely understood. Spatial networks are especially challenging as they derive their graph-theoretical properties from local constraints imposed by the embedding metric space.


The aim of this fully funded PhD position is to develop the mathematical theory of spatial networks, and to explain why these networks exhibit specific emergent properties on a macro scale. Unlike conventional graphs, spatial networks exist within an embedding space, allowing us to consider well-defined scaling limits and to “zoom out,” viewing them as continua. Leveraging on the expertise of the network group in Utrecht, you will establish a framework for these limits and apply them to partial differential equations that arise. As such you will attempt to bridge the local topological constraints of networks with their global behaviour.


You will work as a member of the network group at Utrecht University, under the guidance of Dr Ivan Kryven. This position is part of the PRONTO consortium, which aims to advance models in materials science. Two related PhD positions are also being initiated at the University of Amsterdam concurrently, and regular exchange of expertise with your peers from the consortium will provide beneficial growth environment. We anticipate that project’s results will be relevant to other disciplines. Notably, this will give you an opportunity for discussing and communicating your own findings with collaborators, consortium partners and experts in industry.


In this PhD position you will:


* conduct research in spatial networks;
* publish research findings in scientific journals;
* get the opportunity to attend scientific conferences and workshops abroad;
* communicate the findings with our consortium partners and partners in industry;
* undertake a modest teaching load at the Mathematical Institute at Utrecht giving you the opportunity to gain teaching and student supervision experience.


**Your qualities**
------------------


You have a passion for mathematical research and are enthusiastic to make your contribution. With your collaborative attitude and good command of spoken and written English, you are able to contribute to effective cooperation with colleagues and collaboration partners in the research project. You hold a Master’s degree in mathematics or related discipline. If you are close to completing your degree, you are also welcome to apply. We see it is an advantage if you are familiar with graph theory, random graphs, stochastic processes, statistical mechanics or partial differential equations. Familiarity with one the programming languages, for example, Python or Matlab is also seen as an advantage. Willingness and ability to communicate one’s own findings to general audience is appreciated.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for four years;
* a working week of 38 hours and a gross monthly salary between €2,770 and €3,539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products.

-------------------


Join us – we look forward to welcoming you to our Self-Organizing Soft Matter Research Group at Eindhoven University of Technology!


We are seeking a highly motivated PhD Researcher with a passion for quantitative microscopy and physical chemistry of self-assembling materials to join our team to image the behavior of ice-interactive biomaterials on ice with single-molecule resolution. The goal of your project is to develop and use state-of-the-art microscopy tools and quantitative image analysis approaches to discover the physical principles underpinning the activity of novel ice-interactive biomaterials and to tune their interaction with ice to modulate activity as desired.


Key Responsibilities:


* Conduct high-quality, curiosity-driven, original, and independent research focusing on imaging of self-assembling and ice-interactive biomaterials
* Collaborate with a multi-disciplinary and international team of researchers
* Present research findings at conferences and publish in top-tier scientific journals


The formation and growth of ice during freezing, storage, and/or thawing of cryopreserved materials limits the potential of cryopreservation technology for the long-term storage of sensitive materials, such as cells, tissues, and organs. Our group aims to unravel how biological and engineered ice-interactive materials function so that we can create customized chemical cryoprotectants for biomedical and other applications. Recently, we reported sub-zero super-resolution microscopy experiments which allowed us to study for the first time the interfacial dynamics of ice-bound ice-binding proteins at the single molecule level (see PNAS publication for more information). In this project you will build upon these pioneering experiments. You will image the interaction with ice of a novel class of engineered ice-interactive materials at the single molecule level to advance our understanding of how their structure and properties impact their ability to modulate ice crystal formation and growth. In this exciting role, you will work in a vibrant and international research group aiming to advance molecular insight into the working mechanism of novel ice-interactive materials for biomedical applications.

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én wordt jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.

**Opdracht omschrijving:**

FLUX is hét model voor de gerealiseerde reizigersaantallen bij NS. Deze gegevens zijn cruciaal voor diverse bedrijfsprocessen, zoals het verantwoorden van de prestaties aan het ministerie, inzicht geven in de drukte in de treinen en op stations, tot aan de ontwikkeling van reizigersprognoses voor het materieelplan. Zodoende heb je directe impact in het beschikbaar maken van inzichten over onze reizigers.

* Je haalt plezier uit analyseren van technische problemen en het optimaliseren van het (operations-) proces om zo het gebruik van de data voor de afnemers zo soepel mogelijk te maken
* Je werkt graag in een agile team met andere data engineers en data scientists
* Het geeft je energie om continu te innoveren en tegelijkertijd stabiele en betrouwbare resultaten te leveren

**Dit ga je doen**  
Onze missie bij de NS is om Nederland duurzaam bereikbaar te houden, voor iedereen. Inzichten in de reizigersstromen zijn hierbij onmisbaar voor een optimale dienstverlening. Met behulp van geavanceerde modellen bepalen we hoeveel reizigers tussen stations hebben gereisd en met welke treinen ze dat hebben gedaan, ook als ze een keer vergeten zijn om uit te checken.

Team FLUX werkt aan het model dat onze reizigers achteraf toedeelt aan gereden treinen. FLUX is een belangrijke bron voor een diverse groep afnemers binnen NS. Het is van groot belang dat we deze gegevens tijdig, volledig en accuraat aanleveren.

Wij zijn op zoek naar een teamlid met een achtergrond in Data Engineering of MLOps Engineering om ons te helpen FLUX verder te verbeteren.

Om de kwaliteit van het FLUX-model zo hoog mogelijk te houden, werken we continu aan innovaties op het model en de processen. Op korte termijn willen we onze operationele workflows verbeteren om issues snel te identificeren en op te lossen.

Daarnaast liggen er plannen klaar om de kwaliteit van FLUX verder te verhogen, nieuwe bronnen te verwerken, FLUX te versnellen en onze infrastructuur te professionaliseren. Kortom, genoeg uitdagend werk te doen!

**Hier ga je werken**

Op loopafstand van station Utrecht Centraal bundelen zo´n 200 collega´s van de afdeling Data, Innovatie & Analyse (DIA) hun krachten. Hier werkt een mix van ervaringen en persoonlijkheden, die elkaar graag opzoeken om met elkaar te sparren en kennis te delen. De afdeling geeft (interne) gebruikers snel en betrouwbaar inzicht om tot juiste acties te komen door het verzamelen, combineren, analyseren en presenteren van informatie. Als ontwikkelaar in FLUX ben je onderdeel van het Advanced Analytics team, maar overleg je ook veel met collega’s uit andere vakgebieden. Met jou bestaat het team FLUX uit negen personen, inclusief de product owner en scrum master.  
Vanuit DIA werken we samen met collega’s uit IT en de business in multidisciplinaire clusters. Team FLUX valt binnen het cluster Reizigersstromen. Dit cluster bestaat uit ongeveer 30 collega's die gezamenlijk verantwoordelijk zijn voor het leveren en verbeteren van data, inzichten en advies over reizigersstromen, zowel gerealiseerd als prognoses voor de toekomst.

Daarnaast maakt FLUX deel uit van het DIA Advanced Analytics (AA) gilde bij NS, waar teams in zitten die zich bezighouden met het oplossen van complexe (business)vraagstukken met behulp van Machine Learning en AI. Op deze onderwerpen leren we als teams weer van elkaar

Maar dat is zeker niet het enige. De Rabobank is een coöperatieve bank met een missie. Samen met klanten, leden en partners zet de Rabobank zich in voor een sterkere leefomgeving en voor de grote maatschappelijke uitdagingen van nu, met als uitgangspunt dat er samen meer bereikt wordt dan alleen. Die missie kan alleen waargemaakt worden doordat Rabobank een krachtige bank is die efficiënt werkt.


Daarnaast is Rabobank actief betrokken bij veel maatschappelijke initiatieven. Een deel van de winst wordt geïnvesteerd in de samenleving. Verder weg, door te zorgen dat boeren een eerlijke prijs krijgen voor hun producten. En dichtbij, door in heel Nederland samen buurten beter te maken. Zo’n 1250 organisaties in sport en cultuur die voor veel mensen een tweede thuis zijn worden ondersteund. Een ander voorbeeld is het project met Humanitas, waarin mensen worden geholpen die financiële problemen hebben hun thuisadministratie op orde te krijgen. Een derde voorbeeld is dat samen met Vluchtelingenwerk Nederland 1.500 vluchtelingen worden geholpen bij het vinden van een goed passende baan.


Om haar kerntaak blijvend te realiseren heeft Rabobank een ambitieus plan opgesteld waarin het creëren van een optimale Engineering Journey een belangrijke pijler is.

Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

As a data platform engineer, you will be working on our data platform named Thor. With Thor, we want to create a self-service, metadata driven data platform where data producers can share their data with the data consumers without the platform team being the bottleneck. This means that we are working hard to enable our users so they can do as much as possible themselves and we can focus on improving and optimizing our pipelines and codebase.

 **A few cool new features we have recently implemented:**

* Smart Scheduling that dynamically changes data pipeline configuration based on historical statistics
* A versioned data platform that allows the product to scale to other brands
* Documentation that writes itself


If you want to know more about how it is to work in this team, read: https://werk.ah.nl/colleagues/charlotte-van-der-scheun/

* You optimize performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency of data pipelines and analytics workloads on Databricks
* You enable data producers with self-service capabilities on our data platform granting them the freedom to autonomously share their data to the rest of the organization for data driven insights
* You stay informed latest developments on technologies and industry trends, and evaluate their potential impact on our data platform strategy

 **Your new team and office.**

Our teams work in a hybrid way: both from home as well as in the office. We are located right next to the train station of Zaandam.

For this job we are preferably looking for someone who brings diversity to our team, in the widest possible sense. Someone who is a great addition to our team by bringing other ideas to the table. Don’t check all the boxes? Don’t worry, we probably don’t either . Don’t hesitate to apply if you think you are up for the challenge, we’re happy to have a look at your resume!

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience

* Flexible working hours

* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee

Albert Heijn goes way back. More than 135 years, to be exact. So for millions of people, food shopping is synonymous with the Albert Heijn brand.

More than 125,000 colleagues? Check. Over 1,250 stores in the Netherlands and Flanders? Check. The leading online food retail platform? Check, we build, run and love it.

Integreren en realiseren van koppelingen met meer traditionele dataleveranciers en afnemers. Dit kunnen services zijn, streaming data, maar in enkele gevallen misschien ook nog wel een legacy systeem met een batch koppeling met CSV-bestanden. Concreet: integreren van systemen tot een totaaloplossing.


Migreren van bestaande data-oplossingen naar de nieuwe Azure-oplossingen. Concreet: realiseren van betrouwbare migratiepatronen om (veelal) een geleidelijke migratie mogelijk te maken.

-------------------


From a scientific perspective, contact line motion remains a challenging subject for both theoretical, experimental and numerical fluid mechanics due to the occurrence of a shear stress singularity at the three-phase contact line. In technological applications such as immersion lithography, it is desirable to displace liquid across a partially wettable but heterogeneous (wafer) surface as quickly as possible and without leaving any residue. In this project you will investigate the interplay between capillary and inertial aspects of contact line motion and its interaction with non-flat surface topography and variable surface composition. You will specifically consider the critical substrate speed – corresponding to the transition towards droplet shedding or the entrainment of thin films on the surface – as a function of the geometrical and compositional surface parameters. You will also study the dynamics of splashing, which occurs on topographically patterned surfaces, when an array of high-speed gas-jets is used to displace and control the receding side of the liquid meniscus.


This project consists of a combination of experiments and numerical simulations. The experiments will involve high-speed visualization of contact-line dynamics on suitably prepared surfaces. You will study surface heterogeneities both regarding composition and topography and systematically vary the dimensions, shapes and amplitudes of the patterns. The numerical simulations will be based on existing finite-element, lattice Boltzmann and volume-of-fluid codes.


You will become a member of the group *Fluids & Flows* of the Department of Applied Physics and contribute to our research line of *Micro- and Nanofluidics*. This project is part of a larger research program that involves close collaboration with the University of Twente and the research division of ASML. Moreover, it is embedded in the J.M.Burgerscentrum – the Dutch National Research School on Fluid Mechanics. It offers the unique opportunity for you to do high-level fundamental research with clear application-inspired and technology-relevant aspects. Your results will help improve immersion lithography, which is a fabrication technology for semiconductor devices that are at the heart of all modern technology (e.g. computers, smart phones, electrical cars, …).


Besides research you will also contribute to education within our group and the Department of Applied Physics. You will guide and supervise BSc and MSc students in their research projects. Other assistance in education, e.g. in BSc-level courses, is usually limited to around 5% of your contract time. Note that if you are specifically interested in teaching and education, there is the option for a 1-year extension of your PhD studentship. Your teaching and education tasks will then amount to a time equivalent of more than a full contract year during your PhD project. Please express your interest to the vacancy holder/supervisor in charge.


**Job requirements**
--------------------


For the experimental position, we are looking for an enthusiastic PhD-student with an excellent background in fluid dynamics. Typically, you have an MSc degree in (applied) physics, mechanical or chemical engineering. Prior experience with experiment design, instrument control, data acquisition and image analysis are assets. You should be able to work in a team and have good written and oral communication skills in English.


**Conditions of employment**
----------------------------


A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:


* Full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.
* Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the *Collective Labour Agreement* for Dutch Universities, scale P (min. €2,770 max. €3,539).
* A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.

As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**Who we are:**  

The Rainforest Alliance is creating a more sustainable world by using social and market forces to protect nature and improve the lives of farmers and forest communities. To achieve our mission, we partner with diverse allies around the world to drive positive change across global supply chains and in many of our most critically important natural landscapes.  

  

Our alliance spans 70 countries and includes farmers and forest communities, companies, governments, civil society, and millions of individuals. Together we work to protect forests and biodiversity, take action on climate, and promote the rights and improve the livelihoods of rural people.  

  

As an international nonprofit organization with more than 30 years of experience in sustainability transformation, we understand that the social and economic well-being of rural communities is tightly connected to ecosystem health. This knowledge has shaped our rigorous programs to advance sustainable land-use and commodity production.  

  

At the Rainforest Alliance we combat climate change, protect forests and biodiversity, promote human rights, and improve livelihoods. The enormity of the social and environmental challenges we are facing requires working together in a broad alliance. This is why we bring farmers, forest communities, companies, and consumers together to change the way the world produces, sources, and consumes.  

  

**Why**  

To protect nature and improve lives it’s becoming increasingly urgent that we approach the way we use our land and produce food and other products in more sustainable ways. For this to succeed we need to fundamentally change the way that businesses operate and source, and the choices we all make as consumers.  

  

**How**  

Our growing global alliance aims to transform our relationship with our natural resources and each other, to create a better future for people and nature together.

Het Business Informatie Centrum (BIC) is het proactieve competence centre voor het verstrekken, analyseren van en adviseren over data voor de IND.

Je adviseert en informeert directie en managementteam over nieuwe mogelijkheden op het gebied van informatie gedreven besturen, zowel data inhoudelijk als vanuit de ontwikkelingen in het BI-vakgebied. Je bewaakt continu de uitgangspunten van het datawarehouse en vormt visie over informatiemanagement, draagt deze uit en begeleidt de organisatie hierin naar een hoger volwassenheidsniveau. Je draagt bij aan het ‘informatie denken’ binnen de IND door het opleiden en begeleiden van IND medewerkers op elk niveau in het gebruik en toepassing van BI.


**Voornaamste taken en verantwoordelijkheden:**

Je inventariseert de IND informatiebehoefte en onderscheidt deze naar verantwoordings- en/of besturingsinformatie. Je overziet en bewaakt hierin afdeling, directie, organisatie en keten overschrijdende afhankelijkheden. Je vertaalt de informatiebehoefte waar nodig naar BI-oplossingen vergezeld door impact/quickscan analyses, die zich richten op de inhoudelijke, organisatorische en IT-aspecten.

Naast het salaris ontvang je een Individueel Keuzebudget (IKB). Het IKB bestaat uit geld (16,50% van je bruto jaarsalaris) en tijd. Met het IKB maak jij de keuzes die bij jou passen en kun je een deel van je arbeidsvoorwaarden zelf samenstellen. Je kunt er bijvoorbeeld voor kiezen om een deel van je maandinkomen te laten uitbetalen wanneer jij dat wenst.

Bedrijfsvoering zorgt ervoor dat de IND als concern en de keten als geheel hun taken zo goed mogelijk kunnen uitvoeren. De directie wil haar klanten (alle IND-collega’s en vele ketenpartners) snel en vakkundig bedienen: met een brede blik op het gebied van HR, financiën, control, Lean, interne audits, huisvesting en facilitaire voorzieningen. Dat betekent dat wij weten wat onze klanten nu maar ook in de toekomst nodig hebben, zodat we duurzame en toekomstbestendige (integrale) adviezen en diensten leveren.



De directie Bedrijfsvoering bestaat uit de directeur en een aantal MT-leden, die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de onderliggende afdelingen van BV. De directeur en MT-leden worden ondersteund door managementondersteuners. De inhoudelijke ondersteuning van (plaatsvervangend) directeur en de overige MT-leden vindt plaats door directie- en afdelingssecretarissen. De managementondersteuners, de secretarissen en de informatiemanagers vormen de Staf van de directie Bedrijfsvoering.


**Afdeling Financiën en Business Informatie**



De afdeling Financiën en Business Informatie (FBI) is een afdeling waarin alle onderdelen van de financiële functie bij elkaar zijn gebracht. Onze ambitie is om de businesspartner van de IND te zijn. Om dat doel te bereiken gaan we de komende jaren onze toegevoegde waarde verbeteren en bouwen we aan een stevig financieel fundament. Dat betekent dat we samen met de business de (financiële) sturing gaan verbeteren door proactief en met kennis van zaken mee te denken, bijvoorbeeld over een efficiëntere inrichting van klantprocessen, handhaving en risicogericht sturen. Dit is ook nodig in een context waarin sprake is van afnemende middelen enerzijds en een continue vraag om kwaliteitsverbetering anderzijds.



De afdeling kent vijf teams: Inkoop Servicedesk, Business Informatie Centrum, Concern, Control en Verbijzonderde Interne Controle en Innovatie.


**Business Informatie Centrum**



Het Business Informatie Centrum (BIC) levert vele standaardrapportages, zoals dashboards met in-, door- en uitstroomgegevens, maar levert ook rapportages op basis van ad-hoc-vragen. De dashboards en rapportages bevatten financiële gegevens, kwantitatieve analyses, voorspelmodellen zoals klantprofielen en andere kwantitatieve data. Directies kunnen mede hierop hun verbeterplannen baseren. Het BIC werkt steeds nauw samen met haar afnemers en ontwikkelt producten die deze afnemers toegevoegde waarde opleveren. Tegelijk worden de producten zo veel mogelijk universeel opgezet, zodat ze breed toepasbaar zijn. Wij zijn ook verantwoordelijk voor het beheer en de doorontwikkeling van het datawarehouse van de IND. Daarbinnen valt ook het bundelen van meerdere informatiebronnen en het opleveren van nieuwe rapportages die de bedrijfsvoering van de IND ondersteunen.



**Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst**
--------------------------------------



Een vluchteling die niet veilig is in eigen land. Een ingenieur die zijn kennis in Nederland in de praktijk komt brengen. En een gezin dat elkaar na jaren weer in de armen kan sluiten. Wat ze met elkaar gemeen hebben? De IND beoordeelt hun verzoeken om in Nederland te mogen wonen of Nederlander te willen worden.



De IND voert het vreemdelingenbeleid in Nederland uit. Dat betekent dat we alle verblijfsaanvragen beoordelen. Het kan daarbij gaan om vluchtelingen die niet veilig zijn in eigen land en daarom hier asiel aanvragen. Of om mensen die hier willen werken, studeren, of een gezin vormen met iemand die hier al woont. Maar het kan ook gaan om mensen die hier al zo lang wonen dat zij zich Nederlander voelen en die daarom via een naturalisatieverzoek een Nederlands paspoort aanvragen.



De IND wil een compacte en wendbare uitvoeringsorganisatie zijn met hoogwaardige kennis op het vreemdelingendomein en met oog voor de menselijke maat. De IND moet kunnen inspelen op wisselende eisen en omstandigheden en tegelijkertijd moet de kwaliteit van dienstverlening voorop blijven staan. Dit vraagt om een proactieve organisatie die zich voortdurend ontwikkelt. Daarvoor zijn medewerkers nodig die dit willen en kunnen ondersteunen. Medewerkers die breed inzetbaar zijn en die willen investeren in hun persoonlijke ontwikkeling. De IND investeert graag in deze medewerkers!

Translational research leverages real-world data sets to study how patients respond to cancer treatments. This research often involves integrating complex and non-standardized molecular and clinical data. Clinical datasets, designed to answer specific scientific questions, typically lack detailed data granularity, making exploration challenging. Understanding the clinical data model is crucial to selecting the appropriate variables for analysis.
This project proposes the use of graph databases to overcome these challenges by organizing data into a flexible, multidimensional structure that facilitates easier access and more intuitive querying. Graph databases, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, allow for the discovery of implicit relationships within the data that traditional table-based databases might miss. Through this initiative, we aim to develop and evaluate AI-driven querying techniques using natural language, enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets in translational research.
Responsibilities* Technology Exploration: Investigate various graph database technologies and their applicability to managing clinical data, assessing their strengths and limitations in this domain.
* Data Model Comparison: Compare and analyze the data structures of graph and relational databases to identify the most effective frameworks for clinical data.

* Natural Language Query Development: Create methods to enable querying of graph databases using natural language, employing advanced AI technologies to facilitate intuitive data interactions.
* Findings Presentation: Regularly present progress and insights during team meetings, ensuring clear communication of developments and challenges.
* Bonus Objective: Develop a user interface that enables easy querying, and effective visualization and presentation of results from the database.


Requirements* Education: You are a BSc/MSc student in bioinformatics, computational biology or a related field.
* Technical skills: Demonstrated strong technical skills, with substantial experience in Python programming. Familiarity with AWS is an added advantage.
* Soft skills: Comfortable with pioneering research and creative processes; scientific thinking and connecting that to technical requirements.


About You* You are passionate about our purpose and genuinely care about our mission to transform the lives of patients through innovative cancer treatment
* You bring rigor and excellence to all that you do. You are a fierce believer in our rooted-in-science approach to problem-solving
* You are a generous collaborator who can work in teams with diverse backgrounds
* You are determined to do and be your best and take pride in enabling the best work of others on the team

Our alliance spans 70 countries and includes farmers and forest communities, companies, governments, civil society, and millions of individuals. Together we work to protect forests and biodiversity, take action on climate, and promote the rights and improve the livelihoods of rural people.  

  

As an international nonprofit organization with more than 30 years of experience in sustainability transformation, we understand that the social and economic well-being of rural communities is tightly connected to ecosystem health. This knowledge has shaped our rigorous programs to advance sustainable land-use and commodity production.

**Why**  

To protect nature and improve lives it’s becoming increasingly urgent that we approach the way we use our land and produce food and other products in more sustainable ways. For this to succeed we need to fundamentally change the way that businesses operate and source, and the choices we all make as consumers.  

  

**How**  

Our growing global alliance aims to transform our relationship with our natural resources and each other, to create a better future for people and nature together.

The lab investigates how AI-driven applications in the media change the public sphere, civic engagement and economic competition, and explores novel ways of applying AI in the media. The Distributed & Interactive Systems (DIS) research group at CWI combines data science with a strong human-centric, empirical approach to understand the experience of users. This enables us to design and develop next generation intelligent and empathic systems. We base our results on realistic testing grounds and data sets, and embrace areas such as ubiquitous and affective computing, human-centered multimedia systems, and human-AI interaction.


Encounters with AI-generated content can impact the human experience of algorithms, and more broadly the psychology of Human–AI interaction. In particular, AI system disclosures can influence users’ perceptions of media content. There is a growing concern that as generative AI becomes more widely used, manipulated content could easily spread false information. As a key step toward mitigating harms and risk, a key recent mitigation effort involves the European Al Act Proposition “Transparency Obligations for Providers and Users of Certain AI Systems and GPAI Models”, which seeks to address the issue of AI system transparency.


The research scope broadly addresses the effective, trustworthy, and transparent communication of AI system disclosures. We aim to account for ethical and legal considerations, design and human factors perspectives, as well as policy recommendations. As such, this role may involve relevant stakeholders where necessary, ranging from media organizations, policy makers, as well as AI researchers and practitioners. The initial focus is on the end-user (media consumer) perspective, and at later stages, on the perspective of the media organizations and the generative AI media production process itself. For this postdoc, we are specifically interested in how trust in AI systems can be garnered by focusing on creating better user interfaces and/or understanding human-AI system interactions at a cognitive, behavioral, and physiological level. By establishing user-centric designs for transparent AI disclosures, we can take steps toward ensuring a well-functioning democratic society.


We expect the postdoc researcher to be embedded within the AI, Media, and Democracy lab, which is located in Amsterdam’s city center.


**Topics of interest include:**


* Intelligent visualization techniques, adaptive user interfaces (UI), and content personalization, that allows tailoring users’ experience of the UI and media content as well as any associated disclosures and/or explanations
* User behavioral and physiological sensing techniques for human-AI interaction, that can help predict the right balance between information overload and the essential information to be communicated to users to build user trust in systems employing generative AI
* Developing and evaluating novel user interfaces for journalism that incorporate meaningful disclosure mechanisms for generative AI, from news production to audience engagement, to ensure user agency and autonomy
* Designing and evaluating explainability interfaces for journalists and editors working with AI to ensure responsible decision making
* Empirical studies (online and/or lab-based) to understand the relationship between AI disclosures and how people perceived AI content, for both users and media organization

Je weet feilloos wanneer PR de grens van commercie of marketing raakt en wanneer een kans kan omslaan in een (reputationele) bedreiging. Daarnaast ben je goed op de hoogte van wat er leeft onder onze klanten, in de maatschappij en in de financiële sector en spot jij kansen die je pro-actief ter tafel brengt. Je onderhoudt bovendien een sterk en stabiel netwerk van journalisten bij nationale media en influencers. Hiervoor werk je nauw samen met de woordvoerders van de bank.

* Je bent een verbinder – je hebt een externe blik en verbindt kansen van buiten met projecten en mensen van binnen. Je weet ook je opdrachtgevers te overtuigen met je advies en ideeën.
* Je werkt data gedreven - je weet hoe de tools werken en kunt op basis van data je beslissingen onderbouwen.
* Je hebt oog voor reputatie - snappen van het beleid, niet alleen kansen pakken, maar het grotere geheel kunnen overzien waarin ABN AMRO opereert.

**Functieomschrijving**  

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van het AD in Rotterdam. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data. Dat betekent dat je met cijfers bezig bent, maar ook veel met redactieleden overlegt en ze traint in hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter online presenteren. Je analyseert, rapporteert en geeft dus advies.

  


Je gaat op zoek naar antwoorden op vragen als: Waarom haken mensen af in een artikel? Wat is de ideale mix aan verhalen? Wat is de optimale spreiding van artikelen over de dag? En waarom stijgt of zakt het bezoek de afgelopen weken?

  


De adviezen geef je op drie ‘snelheden’: live, in dag- en weekrapporten en in losse analyses. Op de dag zelf kijk je met een schuin oog mee naar de cijfers en deel je belangrijke actiegerichte inzichten met de redactie. In dag- en weekrapporten geef je duiding aan de cijfers. Naast de dagelijkse taken voer je ook regelmatig diepgravende analyses uit.

  


Je bent een belangrijke sparringpartner voor de chefs en hoofdredactie bij AD en werkt nauw met hen samen.

We werken aan creatieve oplossingen voor complexe vraagstukken. Dat lukt alleen met een fijne werksfeer en met goed teamwork. Naast redactie-analisten zijn er diverse centrale rollen in het team die jou bij je werk zullen ondersteunen.  

  

**Functieprofiel**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.


**VOORWAARDEN**


* salaris, passend bij jouw ervaring;
* 38-urige werkweek, minder uur in overleg;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;
* ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden d.m.v. opleidingen en trainingen;
* We geloven in een gezonde werk-privébalans waarbij je voldoende ruimte krijgt voor jouw welzijn en flexibel werken.

Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware twee talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.

----------------------------------


Job Squad was founded by a couple of young Danish entrepreneurs with a passion for recruitment and HR. One has years of experience in corporate recruitment, the other is a startup obsessed with more than 4 of these young businesses to his name. Both of these young mavericks came together with their shared experiences to create Job Squad, a personal recruitment agency with a corporate twist. Job Squad’s vision was to create career opportunities for Europeans across borders, that will strengthen and develop their personality and career diversity. By breaking down borders and bringing on a wide variety of clients and positions we try to make sure there’s a position and dream destination for everyone.


At Job Squad we like to think of ourselves as professionals without the formality - after all, we are here to help and make sure both job hunt and relocation are as seamless and supportive as possible. Furthermore, we are a big multinational team, living and working in many different countries, but working closely both in and between teams! An internship at Job Squad means that you will become an essential part of the team, and you will have tasks and responsibilities and we expect you to be proactive.

En denk je graag op strategisch niveau na over optimale inzet van online content om arboprofessinals te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk? Dan is de baan van hoofdredacteur Arbo mogelijk iets voor jou.

**Hybride werkvorm** – Minimaal 1 dag werken we in ons prachtige kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van de tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.  

**Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Arbo is sinds kort onder een compleet nieuw team met een nieuwe contentstrategie en er is veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën.  

**Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten van wie je kunt leren.
