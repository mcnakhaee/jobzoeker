**What are you going to do**  

The Postdoc will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.  

The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and one Postdoc, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).  

  

**What are you going to do**

You will work on a wide array of research tasks, that include designing and performing empirical studies, and co-supervising PhDs and RA’s working on the project. There will be ample room for your own contributions and creativity, and writing grant applications together.  

Your tasks as a Postdoctoral researcher within this ERC Consolidator project will include the following:
* Supervise RA’s and PhD’s working on the project;
* Draft pre-registrations and submit ethics reviews.
* Conduct data-analysis and prepare results for publications;
* Draft articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals;

Contribute to the Connected Minds Lab and the wider scientific community through collaborations, workshops, presentations/talks, attending conferences.  
* 

**What do you have to offer**  

You are a conscientious and collaborative researcher who prefers to work in a team and has an affinity with computational modeling and programming.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

We are looking for a motivated postdoctoral researcher with an interest and expertise in building computational models of body representation, technological augmentation, and embodiment. The goal of the project is to uncover the neurocognitive principles underlying the embodiment of finger-extending exoskeletons. To what extent do internal representations of the body and technology (e.g. exoskeletal fingers) fuse into a single representation? To make headway on answering this fundamental question, we will use a variety of neuroscientific approaches (behaviour and M/EEG) and analytical tools (computational modelling, machine learning).
  
  

**You will be part of the NOW VIDI Grant ’Human 2.0:** A neurocognitive framework for upgrading the body’. As a postdoctoral researcher, you will design novel behavioural and neuroimaging paradigms (EEG) to measure internal representations of the body and tools (specifically, finger-extending exoskeletons), as well as their fusion. In this project, we endeavour to understand the fusion process at a neurocomputational level. You will apply Bayesian modelling to behavioural data to characterise the somatosensory and multisensory transformations underlying fusion. You will then use machine learning approaches to identify neural signatures of their implementation in EEG signals. The overall goal of these experiments is to gain a better understanding of the embodiment of technology at a computational and neural level. There will be close collaboration with other members of the team, including colleagues throughout the Donders Institute. Project management and mentoring (MSc and BSc) will also be part of your responsibilities.

***Passionate about the scientific analysis of Cultural Heritage? Join us in building the next generation X-ray instrument for art and archaeology!***


Job description


The most advanced X-ray based techniques are availble at synchrotron radiation sources, such as the ESRF in Grenoble or DESY in Hamburg. Access to these extremely bright sources is limited, and Dutch researchers are in a disadvantageous position as the Netherlands are not directly involved in any of these centres of research. The Smart\*Light project (https://interregvlaned.eu/en/smart-light-2-0/) aims to make advanced X-ray analysis techniques available in the Netherlands. Several institutes in The Netherlands (TU Delft, TU Eindhoven, DIFFER) and Flanders (UAntwerpen, UGent) collaborate to develop a compact instrument that comprises an intense and energy-tunable X-ray source, X-ray optics and detectors. The source is based on the Inverse Compton Effect, where visible laser light, scattered by a relativistic electron beam, is promoted into the X-ray range, yielding a brilliant, coherent X-ray beam with a narrow bandwidth.



Your main task will be to build and commission the experimental endstation of Smart\*light. This endstation is meant for a characterisation of the beam and proof of principle experiments with a focus on cultural heritage objects (art objects or archaeological objects). This involves testing different components in the laboratory with X-ray tubes, verify their integration into the control software, determine spectroscopic figures of merit, optimize the instrument and demonstrate its capabilities in the first experiments. Based on the early experiments you will be involved in the planning of future Smart\*Light upgrades, especially regarding optics and beam shaping.



This work will be done within the team of the Alfeld Lab at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering of the Delft University of Technology. The Department of Materials Science is a diverse institution, working in small laboratories, headed by independent PIs on a range of topics, including optimising steel microstructure, corrosion, recycling and the investigation of cultural heritage. The Alfeld Lab is working on the multi-modal investigation of cultural heritage, with a special focus on X-ray investigations and the development of new instruments and data evaluation approaches.



You will work with the PI of the group, M. Alfeld, on the Smart\*Light endstation in the lab in Delft and with the team of the TU/e on the installation of the endstation in Eindhoven. It is possible to supervise Master students during the project and to pursue independent research endavours related to spectroscopy and/or cultural heritage.


Requirements


* You have experience in the operation and configuration of X-ray instruments for spectrometry, diffraction, imaging or similar techniques.
* You need to have a PhD in science (preferrably physics or chemistry) or engineering (materials science).
* You can work independently in an interdisciplinary environment with multiple stakeholders.
* You have at least moderate programming skills in python or the readiness to acquire these during the project.
* You have a good command of the English language, as you will be working in an international environment, and preferably of Dutch.
* You do not need to have worked with cultural heritage before, but it is a definite bonus.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



From 1 September next, a salary increase of 3.7% applies due to a Collective Agreement amendment, followed by an additional 1% increase on 1 January 2025. In addition, most employees employed on 1 September 2024 will receive a one-off payment of €300 gross based on full-time employment.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for a:  

  

**Postdoc on Causal Machine Learning for Spatio-temporal Datasets**


The Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) is looking for an excellent Postdoc researcher (1.0 FTE) with a background in Computer Science (or a closely related field) to join a project focused on developing an advanced machine learning framework for spatio-temporal datasets. The position is for 4 years and is partially funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) through the Aspasia premium awarded to dr. Mitra Baratchi for her research on machine learning for spatio-temporal data. The successful applicant will be embedded in the Spatio-temporal data Analysis and Reasoning (STAR) and the Automated Design of Algorithms (ADA) research groups and collaborate with researchers at the Natural Computing (NACO) and the Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) Research Groups. Moreover, there are plenty of opportunities for interaction and collaboration with other groups at the institute and internationally.  

  

The research project is broadly focused on automated intervention design. An intervention is any external interference in an ongoing process that is performed to achieve a particular outcome. Being able to answer interventional questions automatically will help decision-makers solve complex challenges (i.e., reducing methane emissions or reducing the infection rate during a pandemic). Most machine learning algorithms designed for spatio-temporal data do not allow assessing the impact of interventions without capturing causal links. At the same time, configuring causal machine learning algorithms is extremely difficult, being an unsupervised learning task. In this project, we aim to design algorithmic solutions (e.g., new Automated Machine Learning approaches) for automatic and scalable assessment of interventions based on observational spatio-temporal datasets generated by modern sensing technologies (e.g., IoT sensors, mobile devices, Earth observations).

 **Key Responsibilities**


Within this position, it is expected that you will:

* conduct research within the scope of the project leading to peer-reviewed publications in journals and conference proceedings;
* collaborate closely with dr. Elena Raponi (the Natural Computing Group) and dr. Saber Salehkaleybar (the Explanatory Data Analysis Group) at LIACS;
* engage in teaching activities of the STAR Research Group and supervision of BSc and MSc students;

 **Selection Criteria**


We are looking for a candidate with expertise or experience with one or more of the following topics: machine learning for spatio-temporal data, causal machine learning (casual discovery and causal inference), and automated machine learning.

* holding (or close to acquiring) a PhD degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence or a closely related field;
* strong research vision and an academic mindset;
* strong publication record;
* being able to collaborate with scientific peers inside and outside your own research area;
* strong programming skills in Python or other programming languages;
* excellent proficiency and communication skills in English;

Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips.

Are you an IT enthusiast who wants to rise above yourself, in both your profession and as a person? At the TU/e, scientists and students continuously create the unthinkable. The strength of TU/e’s IT landscape is their key to success and, hence, so are you as being an essential contributor to that landscape. These creative minds expect you to offer them a solution for tomorrow that doesn’t exist today. Together we are building the high performance backbone that this epicenter of science and technology demands. Are you driven by taking ownership and do you have an entrepreneurial mindset? We like to get in touch with you!  

  

**About Library and Information Services (LIS)**  

The service department Library and Information Services (LIS) service is responsible for the entire demand - supply chain in the fields of information management, IT and library services. In consultation with stakeholders, requirements are collected, prioritized and aligned. The service department consists of six Product Areas: Library and Open Science, Research, Education, Corporate, Data & Insights and Platforms. Product Area Research is looking to strengthen their Research IT team with a consultant for the department Mathematics and computer science.  

  

**About the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science**  

With over 110 (assistant, associate and full) professors, almost 300 PhD and EngD students, about 1500 Bachelor students and 1000 Master students, the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) is the largest department of the TU/e. By performing top-level fundamental and applied research, and maintaining strong ties with industry, M&CS aims to contribute to science and innovation in and beyond the region.  

The department’s relationship with the high-tech industry in the Brainport region means that interested staff and students can contribute directly to the development of technological innovations with real-world relevance. Several successful spin-offs have originated from the department and our staff participates in many national and international research consortia.  

  

**The postion**  

As a research IT consultant, you work in collaboration with researchers to develop fit-for-purpose, sustainable IT solutions. In addition, you provide (proactive) advice on how to translate functional IT requirements to technical products, services and workflows. You work in proximity of the department and its IT landscape, and have a pioneering role in setting up innovative (specific) solutions. You are part of a multidisciplinary team in which you share and learn from each other’s knowledge and expertise. This enables you to facilitate researchers at TU/e in conducting their research. You work for a department which fosters multidisciplinary research requiring highly specialized computational methods. With your broad range of interests and ability to oversee the complex landscape of interests and challenges, you facilitate the needs of research, so that scientists can focus on their most innovative work. You will also have the opportunity to build up an extensive network and to specialize in relevant research areas.


How this looks like in practice? Read the following section:  

  

**A typical week of a Research IT consultant at M&CS:**  

On Monday, you start the week together with the departmental IT support unit (“The Hub”) and review the current developments and your activities at M&CS. Together, you align on priorities and determine tactics for the best approach. In the afternoon, you visit a researcher who wants to scale up their computational jobs, by parallelizing the script to compute efficiently on the available resources. You advise them on what resources could be suitable for this use case and optionally get them in contact with expert support on this topic. At the same time, you notice you receive this type of question quite often, so you coordinate with the back-office to make sure we can support this type of request long-term.


On Tuesday, you work out a plan to facilitate in the IT requirements for a new Computer Science lab at the department, in alignment with the TU/e policies and frameworks for deploying IT. As development of this lab


might be interesting for the whole department, you prepare an agenda item for the department's IT committee. As you work in the same room with your fellow consultants in the afternoon, you can easily count on their help on how to approach this.


On Wednesday, you work at home and focus on developing and testing an IDE platform for specific applications that are needed for the Machine Learning group. You maintain a close feedback loop with the users and make agreements on structural support of the prototype. You inform your colleagues as they might also be interested in such a platform for their customers.


On Thursday, you meet the board during your regular check-in moment to report on the progress of their ‘research IT’. You have prepared in advance by checking in with the users and their experience and by analyzing available user data. For instance, you know that their VM facility is running out of capacity, so you advise them in policy-making to distribute the resources more efficiently. In the afternoon, you have a strategic meeting with your fellow consultants on how you want to develop as a team and the services you're offering.


On Friday, you took a seminar in the morning to spike up your research data management knowledge, and this comes in handy as you received a request to consult on a data management workflow for a research group using Git and other storage platforms. You have a call with the Data Steward to work out the details and you contribute to the technical aspects of the workflow.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* You have a minimum education of a Master’s degree or PhD degree, preferably with a background in Computer Science, Data Science or any related field;
* Several years of experience with conducting research, and you are able to effectively communicate with scientific staff;
* You are organizationally sensitive; you initiate and maintain relevant relationships with customers, (key) user groups, and suppliers;
* You identify the wishes and needs of our researchers, to proactively provide fit-for-purpose, IT solutions, and at the same time make proposals for sustainable innovation implementation based on demand trends;
* You are a pleasant collaboration partner for both scientists and the IT back office, thereby mediating between organization and innovation;
* You initiate action to innovate existing products and services, based on the interest of the department you represent;
* You have experience with one or more of the following techniques: Remote computing (cloud and / or on premise), Research Data Management and processing, Software Engineering, Git and / or code repository management, Software Licensing, AI related topics, Internet of Things, Infrastructural Architecture;
* Experience with scripting and automating workflows, in particular in Linux OS, is a bonus.


If you are concerned that you don’t meet all the requirements sufficiently, but the job does excite you, then be sure to respond, we would love to look at your profile.

How does the medieval body of texts known as 'canon law' reflect social and moral ideas? With a combination of AI and an advanced dataset, can we reveal patterns in the transmission and alteration of these ideas over time? Join the SOLEMNE project as a research assistant to explore these questions and more.
  
  

The medieval body of texts known as 'canon law' not only regulates strictly religious or ecclesiastical issues but also communicates social and moral ideas about the inner life of society. With an advanced dataset and novel AI techniques, it is possible to chart how such ideas are transmitted, appropriated, altered, and promoted in canonical collections. As a research assistant you will contribute to this study by expanding its data entry and training AI models.
  
  

This one-year position is part of the project 'The Social Life of Early Medieval Normative Texts' (SOLEMNE), funded through an ERC Consolidator Grant awarded to Dr Sven Meeder. A fuller description of the project can be found here. The SOLEMNE project aims to describe and contextualise the spread of social norms as articulated through specific combinations of canons in a bottom-up approach starting from the vast corpus of manuscript witnesses of canonical collections in every shape and form (4th-12th centuries). A dynamic dataset forms an essential element of the project, combined with an innovative digital tool that allows for queries of shared content in canonical collections or manuscripts and of levels of affinity based on combinations of authoritative statements.
  
  

In close collaboration with the project's postdoctoral researcher, associated data scientists, and development team, you will (i) contribute to the design of the database to store the information regarding original medieval manuscripts preserving individual canons and entire canonical collections, and scholarly editions of these texts, (ii) play a key role in training handwritten text recognition (HTR) models using eScriptorium software as well as AI-driven models for correction and normalisation of the transcription, (iii) populate the database with the data gathered from the original documents and printed reference works, (iv) contribute to the wider communication of the project's results, including materials intended for a general audience, and (v) cooperate closely with all of SOLEMNE’s subprojects.

**The challenge**


Eindhoven University of Technology's Industrial Design department developed and implemented Data Foundry, a platform to address these challenges. Data Foundry enables the collection and management of data from remote devices in real-time and supports qualitative data collection, participant management, and data visualization. Data Foundry is also increasingly used to prototype in design using data, server-side scripting and AI. Despite successfully supporting over 2000 design projects, Data Foundry is currently limited to Eindhoven University of Technology due privacy and data sharing protocols. We want to change that and use Data Foundry in collaborative contexts and make Data Foundry available to others design institutions.


This is why we will **open-source Data Foundry** and we need your help for that. The project 'ODeDaI' aims to enhance Data Foundry's configurability and extend its documentation, allowing seamless integration with other universities and institutions. This will enable broader adoption of the platform, ensuring compliance with diverse data sharing policies and promoting open science practices within the design community and beyond. By making Data Foundry adaptable for various institutions and policies, we intend to foster greater collaboration amongst researchers, educational institutions, and industry professionals, both nationally and internationally.

* You will be surrounded by a team of fellow EngDs and PhDs that focus on data-enabled design and more generally new tools and infrastructures for Industrial Design.


**The EngD position**


As a designer and creative technologist you dive deep into understanding the needs and workflows of data x design, both in education and research practice. You work with the Data Foundry infrastructure and prepare it inside-out for an open-source release in 2025. You work as part of the Data Foundry team and realize ideas for new features, documentation and helpful education materials. You build and work with growing community to collect user feedback, early and often.


Requirements


* A Masters degree in an industrial design or creative software development related discipline (e.g., Industrial Design with technical focus, Computer Science or Software Engineering with design affinity). Masters degree needs to be obtained before the prospective starting date of this position: September/ October 2024.


Design creation skills


* Proficient with full-stack integration of different software libraries and adapting them to your needs to build great user experiences (e.g., output of AI algorithms, managing local development environments)
* Knowledge of software designing and architecture, different architectural patterns, data modelling.
* Interest in and understanding of AI, data visualization
* Eye for detail and quality
* Experience with writing technical documentation is a plus.


Soft skills


* Strong collaborator with multi-disciplinary team members and academic design education stakeholders

-------------------


The Department of Industrial Design of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), in cooperation with Philips Clinical Informatics is offering two fully funded 2-year positions to master graduates leading to the award of an EngD (Engineering Doctorate) degree in Designing Human-System Interaction.


**Societal urgency**


Access to high quality healthcare is under increasing pressure. Patient volumes are rising due to an aging population, and the amount of data from scans and image interpretation is increasing at a steeper pace than radiologists and pathologists can handle. Radiology leaders have raised alarm that labor shortages are leading to longer wait times and delays in treatment for patients. Never has there been a bigger need to relieve the pressure from staff. But how exactly do we make that happen?


**The challenge**


Adoption of radiology and pathology solutions is increasingly driven by the extent to which solutions “naturally” fit into clinical workflows and enable radiologists and pathologists to deliver quality at speed. This requires not only high-quality medical data and cutting-edge AI models. More so, clinical acceptance and adoption depends on solutions that are designed with a clear understanding of clinical workflows and usage patterns, and with the requirements that different clinical experts have on their tooling. Beyond functional requirements, successful clinical adoption needs highly intuitive solutions, seamless workflow integration (speed), and a great user experience. In sum, we face the overarching challenge of how to integrate AI-based clinical decision-making tools into clinical practice that is characterized by fast-paced, high-stakes decision-making informed by deep domain knowledge and year-long expertise.


Prototypes that are highly realistic in the eyes of the clinical user have shown to be an important “vehicle” to enable rapid co-creation with clinicians. It enables them to give meaningful clinician-centered direction to development complex technical tools. Are you ready to iteratively create such prototypes and shape them together with experts in the field?


**You are part of a learning community**


You will be strongly embedded in and work closely with a highly dynamic community with experts from different disciplines including designers, researchers, engineers, clinical specialists and business:


* You will work “in-tandem” with your fellow EngD team member. You learn from each other by bouncing-off ideas and taking turns at different steps in the design process.
* You will immerse yourself in the Philips Clinical Informatics business context working closely with the design teams on the latest technology developments in radiology and digital pathology, in close collaboration with hospitals and clinical end-users where the impact is made.
* The EngD program offers a personalized learning experience through a mix of courses, coaching and hands-on learning by doing.
* You will be surrounded by a team of fellow EngDs and PhDs that focus on human-AI collaboration in the healthcare domain.


**The two positions**


**EngD position 1 – The medical data visualization & AI designer**


In this position you dive deep into understanding the needs and workflows of the clinical end users and translate those insights into design concepts and interactive data visualizations. You express your ideas by creating clickable demonstrators together with your buddy “the creative technologist” (the second EngD candidate) and you enjoy using your user research skills to set up interviews and simulated use tests to collect user feedback, early and often.


Requirements


* A Masters degree in an industrial design related discipline (e.g., Industrial Design, Interaction Design, UX-UI, HCI). Masters degree needs to be obtained before the prospective starting date of this position: September/ October 2024.


Design creation skills


* Strong conceptual design skills (translating user insights into concepts pushing the boundaries of the status quo)
* Affinity with UI, visual design skills, wireframes and clickable prototypes (e.g., Figma)
* Data visualization (next gen medical data & AI visualization)
* Interest in and understanding of AI (i.e., integration of AI in user journeys)
* Eye for detail and quality


Design research skills


* Enjoy experimentation with iterations based on user feedback and contextual insights
* Intermediate knowledge of user research methods (e.g., interviews, setting up and running small hands-on user tests with clinical end users, inquiries with stakeholders)


Soft skills


* Strong collaborator with multi-disciplinary team members and industry stakeholders
* Curious to know more about the healthcare domain and in obtaining a deep understanding of clinical end users in their daily work
* Can-do attitude and hands-on designer


**EngD position 2 – The creative technologist**


In this position you use your front-end software prototyping powers to create dynamic and realistic clinical workflow prototypes with clinical data, medical data visualizations and interactive AI outputs. You work closely with your buddy, the “medical data visualization & AI designer” where you take the lead in interactive prototype implementation to create a realistic clinical user experience based on actual data and AI outputs.


Requirements


* A Masters degree in an industrial design or creative software development related discipline (e.g., Industrial Design with technical focus, Computer Science or Software Engineering with design affinity). Masters degree needs to be obtained before the prospective starting date of this position: September/ October 2024.


Technical skills


* Solid front-end software prototyping development skills with modern web technologies and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, data visualization tools and libraries)
* Proficient with full-stack integration of different software libraries and adapting them to your needs to build great user experiences (e.g., output of AI algorithms, managing local development environments)

Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

 **The Role**


Our mission at Netflix is to connect global stories with global audiences. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.


Recently, Netflix has expanded its entertainment offering to include Live content, like The Roast of Tom Brady Comedy Special, the SAG Awards ceremony, and The Netflix Slam tennis match. Our scope will grow to include premium live entertainment with our growing Live content catalogue, including WWE, NFL, and more.


Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips. This is made possible because Netflix UI is a thriving learning machine where Artwork & Video assets are personalized via reinforcement learning.


Europe is a significant center for our broader Studio and Creative Production teams. We’re looking for a Senior Analytics Engineer based in our Amsterdam office to join our growing European team. In this role, you would serve as a trusted partner for regional Creative Production leadership.

* Be a strategic partner for Studio & Creative Production teams: identify critical analytical problems and apply an entrepreneurial mindset to find innovative solutions with data
* Being the lead analytics engineer partnering with our Product Creative Studio partners who are responsible for the promotional assets for Live content experiences.
* Drive the direction of your work, developing solutions that span from scrappy code and prototype tools to high-visibility dashboards and analyses for Studio & Creative Production leadership
* Spearhead the creation of new metrics that impact decision-making
* Collaborate with Data Scientists & Data Engineers to source data from new systems and strengthen our foundational data models
* Become a regional expert on all things Studio Data Science & Engineering, helping educate and connect regional offices to existing data solutions

**You are…**

* A strong communicator who can develop and deepen strong relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders. You have experience partnering closely with executive leadership, with a proven track record of influencing strategic decisions through data.
* Comfortable with ambiguity; able to thrive with minimal oversight and process. You connect the dots across business needs and independently drive projects forward.
* A senior analytics professional with extensive experience across data wrangling, analysis, reporting, and visualization.
* An expert in a data-oriented programming language (e.g. SQL, Python, R, Scala, etc.) and intuitive dashboard/visualization design (e.g. Tableau)
* Proficient in ETL and data warehousing best practices and core statistics concepts (e.g. hypothesis testing)
* Adept at working across different cultures on a globally-distributed team, with core working hours in the Central European and GMT time zones

**Culture**


You will have the opportunity to impact the business in a meaningful way, working alongside smart people who love to solve hard problems, and who not only expect but also foster high performance. You will have the freedom to innovate, solve interesting problems and influence decision-making in a fast paced, exciting environment.

Wij maken van Albert Heijn het beste omnichannel Food & Tech bedrijf en willen digitaal gemak voor iedereen. We testen en experimenteren, zijn innovatief en verleggen grenzen. Voor die reis hebben wij het Data Talent Track. Een track waarin wij jouw carrière als Data Analyst bij Albert Heijn een vliegende start geven binnen onze Digital Analytics afdeling. Is dit echt iets voor jou? Word dan de nieuwe Data Analyst in ons Data Talent Track!

  

  

**Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst ken jij onze klant het beste. Deze kennis verkrijg je door gebruik te maken van data (zoals bijvoorbeeld data over koopgedrag), om zo de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van data-oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk met de nieuwste data analytics technieken. Je maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Analytics & Data Science team, en bent daarmee onderdeel van de grotere Analytics community binnen Albert Heijn. Je beweegt makkelijk tussen Tech, Data Science en de business teams, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data analytics toepassingen. Je maakt impact als Data Analist door:

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

  



**Dit doe je als Data Analyst Digital**

Het Digital domein richt zich op digitale relevantie, experimentation, eCommerce en klantloyaliteit. Hiervoor voeren we data-analyses uit of ontwikkelen wij dataproducten om onze e-commerce en Digital-afdelingen te ondersteunen met inzichten rondom onze klanten, het verbeteren van e-commerce en het verbeteren van de customer journey. Denk daarbij aan projecten zoals het relevanter maken van onze aanbiedingen (Mijn Bonus Box) of marketing, inzichtelijk maken van de omnichannel customer journeys en het analyseren van onze spaarprogramma’s.

  



**Jouw ontwikkeling in het Data Talent Track**


Het Data Talent Track is een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen die je helpen om jouw professionele vaardigheden te ontwikkelen. Zo zijn er trainingen zoals persoonlijk leiderschap en het efficiënter schrijven van code, maar ga je bijvoorbeeld ook een dagje meehelpen in de winkel of bouw je mee aan de ideeën van de toekomst in een Hackathon. Wil je meer weten over hoe het Data Talent Track eruitziet? Neem dan vooral ook eens een kijkje hier.

 **Dit breng je mee**


Als grootste supermarkt van Nederland vullen we met meer dan 100.000 medewerkers dagelijks zo'n 5 miljoen borden. En als het aan ons ligt, doen we dat binnenkort ook samen met jou als onze Data Analyst. Zeker als je de broodnodige pro-activiteit en resultaatgerichtheid naar Albert Heijn meebrengt. Jij bent gedreven, staat sterk in je schoen en de ambitie spat van je af. Ook heb je:

* Een afgeronde wo-opleiding met data- en/of statistische basis zoals Econometrie, Operations Research, Wiskunde, Informatica, Business Analytics of Marketing Intelligence
* Ervaring met werken met grote databases (Python / PySpark / R / SQL)
* Ervaring met het oplossen van business vraagstukken met data analytics en/of Data Science technieken d.m.v. Python / R
* Ervaring met visualisatie tools zoals Tableau of Power BI is een pré


En, niet onbelangrijk, ben je:

* Proactief; je geeft zowel gevraagd als ongevraagd advies
* Sterk in het adviseren van de business en meenemen van stakeholders
* Communicatief sterk; je weet complexe informatie aan een niet-technisch publiek uit te leggen

 **De beste ingrediënten voor een betekenisvolle baan**

* Een salaris van max € 4000,- per periode van 4 weken (afhankelijk van je ervaring)
* Een winstuitkering oplopend van 45 tot 130% van je gemiddelde periodesalaris

We sparen samen voor een heel goed pensioen. En wij betalen ruim 5 keer zo veel als jij. Zo ben je ook later verzekerd van een goed inkomen* Je kunt 45 (ja, vijfenveertig) dagen vrij nemen; 25,5 vaste vakantiedagen en 19,5 ADV dagen. Veel plezier!
* Je ontwikkelt je even snel als de tech waar we mee werken. Dankzij feedback loops met de best & the brightest tech savvy collega’s. En door actief bij te dragen aan de AH Technology community – plons in een zee aan kennis en inzichten!
* Een moderne laptop en smartphone zijn ‘inbegrepen’. Bovendien hamster je kortingen. Op verzekeringen en je boodschappen bijvoorbeeld
* Je neemt deel aan het Data Talent track, een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen, en daarnaast heb je ook toegang tot onze AH Data Academy met nog veel meer trainingen zowel op hard- als soft skills. Jou een vliegende kickstart geven en de kans om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen vinden wij namelijk erg belangrijk
* Een werkgever die het beste van twee werelden combineert: de kansen die je met een corporate associeert plus de autonomie en de “to boldly go where no person has gone before” drive die scale-ups kenmerkt
* De kans om miljoenen mensen gezonder, lekkerder en makkelijker te laten eten

 **Solliciteer**


Klik op de sollicitatiebutton en ontdek hoe je dat, samen met enorm diverse én enorm enthousiaste collega’s, werkelijkheid maakt. We willen je daarbij vragen om geen standaard motivatiebrief te sturen, maar een antwoord te formuleren op de volgende vragen:

**Jouw impact bij Movares**
---------------------------


* Je zorgt ervoor dat de communicatie tussen beveiligingsinstallatie en treindienstleiders goed functioneert. Waarbij telecom is gericht op communicatie tussen treinen en computersystemen en GSM-R op draadloze communicatie tussen treinen en communicatiemasten (UMTS).
* Jij past het communicatienetwerk in de relaishuizen aan. Dat is een wijziging van hardware en software. Deze werkzaamheden worden 's nachts op locatie gedaan;
* Je werkt op projectbasis, adviseert de opdrachtgever, specificeert de product- en materiaaleisen en draagt bij aan het opstellen van offertes.

Je onderhoudt voortdurend contact met relevante partijen om problemen op te lossen en de kwaliteit te waarborgen. Je maakt dus ook gebruik van GSM-R, een geo-informatiesysteem dat veilige communicatie tussen treindienstleiders en machinisten garandeert. Dit systeem definieert een geografisch gebied met zendmasten. Wanneer er wijzigingen zijn aan het spoor, pas je datasheets aan om ervoor te zorgen dat de locatie van de trein correct is gekoppeld aan de juiste GSM-R locatie. Onze afdeling bij Loxia bestaat uit zo’n 30 collega’s die zelfstandig projecten uitvoeren. We zijn een hecht team en lossen samen complexe vraagstukken op. Ons team heeft een hoog verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel want zonder ons rijden er geen treinen. Onze werkzaamheden zijn uniek en complex, daarom is er een opleidingstraject van ruim een jaar, waarin je samen met je mentor het ontwerpproces leert.
**Dit ga je doen bij Movares**
------------------------------


Naast skills in het telecom domein heb je ook communicatieve vaardigheden voor een goede samenwerking met alle betrokken partijen. Je durft regie te nemen en neemt initiatief om werkzaamheden in goede banen te laten lopen. Je bent ongeveer 15 nachten per jaar in het weekend aan het werk bij relaishuizen langs het spoor. Daarom ben je ook in het bezit van een rijbewijs. Alles zoals een auto, hotelovernachtingen en vergoedingen worden geregeld vanuit Movares. **Dit breng je ook mee:**
* afgeronde HBO-opleiding of aantoonbaar MBO+ niveau (elektronica);
* kennis van het telecom domein;
* kennis van treinbeveiliging en/of kennis van ArcGis is een pre.

Jouw ontwikkeling bij Movares Jouw talent en (vakinhoudelijke) kennis benutten én verder ontwikkelen vinden we belangrijk. Dat doen we in talentprogramma’s met intervisiegroepen en tijdens kennissessies door ervaren collega’s. Ook hebben we een eigen Academy met ruim 3.000 verschillende leerlijnen, trainingen en e-learningmodules. In iedere fase van je loopbaan dagen we je uit om jezelf steeds te blijven ontwikkelen. Daar groeien we samen van.
**Dit krijg je bij Movares**
----------------------------


Bij Movares werk je aan projecten met een grote maatschappelijke impact. Daar krijg je iets voor terug dat niet in geld uit te drukken is: voldoening. En natuurlijk zijn onze primaire en secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden uitstekend. We zetten ze voor je op een rijtje:
* een salaris tussen € 3.500,- en € 5.500,-;
* na je proeftijd direct **een vast contract**;
* 36,5 vakantiedagen per jaar (op basis van een fulltime dienstverband), waarvan 5 in het IKB;
* een individueel keuzebudget (IKB) dat bestaat uit een geldbedrag (10,5% bovenop je maandsalaris) en de waarde van 5 vakantiedagen;
* een winstafhankelijke uitkering van maximaal 4%;
* € 30,- per maand voor de inrichting van je thuiswerkplek;
* een NS-Business Card;
* een laptop, simkaart en telefoonbijdrage;
* een ruime pensioenregeling;
* een aangepaste werkplek of extra begeleiding als jij dit nodig hebt.

 En er is méér. Want werken bij Movares betekent ook:
* samenwerken op kantoor in hartje Utrecht in combinatie met werken vanuit huis;
* veel ruimte voor jouw persoonlijke en professionele ontwikkeling;
* bijdragen aan een schone wereld, omdat je werkt bij het eerste bedrijf in Nederland met een Zero Waste-certificaat;

------------------

**Jouw uitdaging**  

In deze rol ligt de focus op data-analyse en ondersteuning van de verschillende divisies op het gebied van KPI's, dashboards en alles wat te maken heeft met de stroom van cijfers.

Als business partner en data-analist ben je sterk in het begrijpen van operationele processen en het omgaan met de grote datastromen die daaruit voortkomen.

**Hoe ziet een werkdag van Iris als Senior Data Analist eruit?**  

Mijn werkdag als analist bij CBR begint altijd met een dagstart met de andere analisten. Hierin bespreken we de stand van zaken met betrekking tot de huidige sprint, of we ergens tegenaan lopen en proberen samen oplossingen te bedenken.  

  

Een werkdag als analist bij CBR is eigenlijk nooit hetzelfde. Een dag vult zich met het voeren van gesprekken met de business, het uitwerken van eerder ingediende dataverzoeken vanuit de business, ad hoc data-analyses en het helpen/meedenken met de andere business analisten.  

Het is daarbij belangrijk om de prioriteiten goed in te schatten en een planning te maken, zodat alles op tijd afkomt. Soms is het wel even schakelen tussen alle verschillende afdelingen en processen, maar dit maakt het werken bij CBR extra leuk en interessant.

Met het IKB maak jij de keuzes die bij jou passen en kun je een deel van je arbeidsvoorwaarden zelf samenstellen.

The Aegean Sea is one of the most important marine biodiversity hotspots in the Mediterranean, with some of the most extensive and pristine seagrass meadows and coralligenous assemblages hosting populations of keystone species. Unfortunately, these biodiversity hotspots and keystone species are at increasing risk of anthropogenic activities such as illegal fishing, tourism and climate change. Archipelagos aims to protect and conserve the Aegean nature with frontier science for conservation, and we need spatial analyses in achieving our goals.

### **GIS-team**


Accurate maps depicting the location of protected habitats is key for the effective management and conservation of biodiversity hotspots. Unfortunately, the lack of accurate mapping in this region limits the extent of conservation action that can be implemented and enforced. The Archipelagos GIS team assists in collecting, interpreting, and visualizing data in all marine projects with the support from our research vessel the ‘Aegean Explorer’, scientific-equipped kayaks and satellite data. Main data sources for the GIS team are collected from an array of important scientific tools, such as a down-scan sonar, multibeam, biomass scanner, ROV and many more. We are involved in many national and international projects to improve the spatial data for the Mediterranean Sea.

### **Examples of recent internship projects**

* Collaborating in collecting, interpreting, and visualizing spatial data, with use of our research vessels, scientific-equipped kayaks and satellite data.
* Producing maps and reports to support conservation purposes.
* Assessing the distribution and density of seagrass meadows in the coastal zones around the Aegean Sea. Research is focused on remote sensing combined with training data obtained from downscan sonar kayak surveys.
* Developing and conducting rapid-assessment mapping techniques, combining citizen science, mulitbeam sonar, biomass scanner and ROV data. These advanced technologies offer valuable insight into coralligenous and other mesobenthic habitats’ presence, resulting in high-resolution distribution maps.
* Using wide range spatial data to map priority for improved management. For example, fishing data, boat traffic and Sentinel satellite imagery.
### **Your role**


The internship will consist of both fieldwork at sea and office work, which will help you to gain a valuable skill set in data collection and analyses from an array of scientific tools. You are providing support to different projects related to the conservation of the Aegean Sea and her islands. As Archipelagos is continually improving the data collection and conservation outputs, you will be encouraged to explore new ideas.

### **Technical skills**


At least one of the following requirements is needed:  

* GIS: Good experience with GIS software (e.g. QGIS, ArcGIS);
* Remote Sensing: Knowledge of Remote Sensing packages (e.g. SNAP, ENVI, ErDAS);
* Data analyses: knowledge in statistics, programming, geospatial analyses with some experience in a programming language such as R or Python.
### **Other skills**

* Fluency in English
* Good communication skills
* Ability to work in a multicultural environment
* Motivation to live in remote places with simple facilities
* Sincere desire to work towards Archipelagos’ conservation efforts
### **What we offer**


We offer an internship at an inspiring institute with experts on coastal conservation. You have the opportunity to collect data for writing a thesis, scientific publications or increasing your skillset within the marine conservation sector. Internships range from 3 – 12 months, although shorter or longer internship periods may be arranged to cover the needs of groups or individuals. As Archipelagos is a non-profit research institute, the internships we offer are unpaid. The experience requires an internship weekly fee of 200 – 245 euros to cover living and research expenses (e.g. housing, 3 meals a day, public liability insurance and other research facilities). Students and recent graduates and researchers are advised to search for possible funding through their universities, by getting in touch with the International Office/ Placement/ Erasmus+ Offices at their Universities or other relevant grant providing organizations in their region.

Do you aspire to gain hands-on experience as a data scientist across various sectors? Are you seeking a dynamic environment where you can kick-start your career with extensive learning opportunities, including on-the-job coaching and a diverse training curriculum? If so, consider applying for the Junior Data Scientist position at IG&H!**

  

As a Data Scientist, you will play a crucial role in helping our clients derive valuable and new insights from large and complex datasets. You start doing this by creating deep understanding of the challenges our clients are facing. Together with your team, you’ll then determine how to create most business value for our clients. Afterward, you’ll apply your knowledge and skills on data modelling in a practical setting. Methods we use range from more basic data processing techniques to machine learning and large language models. Finally, you communicate and present results convincingly, to create real and lasting impact. We believe that those who can combine analytical skills with business sense are most successful in creating this impact for our clients.

  

IG&H is active in three sectors (retail, financial services and health), allowing you to get experience on a variety of projects. On top, you'll be working closely with IG&H consultants outside of the Data & Analytics team too, such that you learn much more than only data related skills. Especially if you start your career at IG&H, this will help you in understanding what you really like doing and want to learn.  



  

Next to excellent employment conditions, working at IG&H will be a great place to kick-start your career. We believe that a caring and fun working environment will help you to dare to step out of your comfort zone and learn. In addition, we offer continuous learning through the IG&H Academy, in which you’ll get training to boost your data science, consulting and people skills. Also, you will be assigned a mentor, who will be there for you to provide you with guidance.  



  

Above all, people are at the heart of what we do. This of course comes back in the work we deliver for our clients (why make a data product if the people who need to use it don’t understand or want to use it?). At the same time, a fun working culture is key for who we are. With an inspiring office in Utrecht where we can connect, have abundant parties, team activities and sport events (both organised for the entire IG&H organization as well as specifically for the Data & Analytics team), IG&H is truly a Great Place To Work. And yes, we are certified!  



  

  

*“In addition to on-the-job learning, you learn everything you need to know about consultancy in the IG&H Academy. The program consists of various internal and external training courses and has been specifically developed for trainees. Besides training sessions, the Academy often organizes trips and dinners. Through these, you quickly develop good relationships with co-workers at IG&H. I see many of them outside of work on a regular basis”* **Jasmijn Haverhals (Consultant Healthcare)**

  

*“The most beautiful thing about consulting is the diversity within the projects. IG&H offers next to different clients, a variety in the types of assignments. One assignment could be very strategic, in which you outline the direction of a company. Whereas another assignment could be focused on implementation, in which you are working together with the client to deliver concrete results.”* **Peter Hardy (Director)**

 **What we ask:**

  

* MSc degree in Econometrics, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence or similar field
* You have excellent Dutch and English communication skills, due to client needs
* Analytical, inventive and practical
* Python and/or R skills


**What we offer you:**

  

* Working at a Great Place To Work with a pleasant atmosphere, enthusiastic colleagues who support you and many fun activities
* Continuous development through the IG&H Academy and active on the job coaching
* Permanent (indefinite) contract right away
* Excellent salary and working benefits
* Company car / good mobility scheme
* 25 holiday days with the possibility to take up to 5 more
* Generous bonus scheme
* Possibility to take a sabbatical after 3 years of employment
* IG&H facilitates a Healthy Human programme, where you get guidance with all adjustments in life, such as having a child or being a caregiver to a sick family member
* Possibility to work parttime (32 hours), at least 4 days a week
* Great opportunity to make an active contribution to the further growth of the organization
* And more, which we would love to elaborate on


**WHY IG&H?**

  


IG&H is transforming leading companies across the Health, Retail and Finance sectors. Together with our world-class technology partners, we help our clients move forward and stay relevant.

-------------------


  
Het landbouw- en voedselsysteem staat volop in de belangstelling. De grote vraag voor politiek, beleid en samenleving is: hoe kan dat systeem verduurzamen, en hoe kan de uitstoot van stikstof en broeikasgassen worden teruggedrongen? Het PBL analyseert en reflecteert op de huidige en toekomstige ontwikkelingen binnen de landbouw. Daarnaast monitort het samen met andere kennisinstituten de voortgang van het stikstofbeleid en het klimaatbeleid. Wij zoeken een enthousiaste en ervaren onderzoeker die zich in dit complexe vraagstuk wil verdiepen.



Wat ga je doen?  

Jij gaat je voornamelijk richten op kwantitatieve analyses van het beleid; hoe werken de verschillende beleidsinstrumenten, tot welke veranderingen in het landbouwsysteem leiden ze en wat zijn de gevolgen voor de uitstoot van stikstof- en broeikasgassen? Je buigt je hierbij over de emissie-effecten en de kosten van verschillende aspecten van de landbouw, variërend van innovatieve technologieën voor stallen en mestverwerking tot extensievere vormen van landbouw, zoals natuur-inclusieve landbouw. Ook ga je je verdiepen in recente ontwikkelingen, zoals de mogelijkheden en knelpunten rond ‘doelsturing’ en het meten van bedrijfsspecifieke emissies. Ons onderzoek betreft tot nu toe vooral het nationale beleid, maar we richten ons vizier in toenemende mate op de rol van provincies.



Dit werk doe je niet alleen; je werkt samen met een aantal collega’s in projecten. Sommige projecten ga je als (deel)projectleider coördineren. Je levert bijdragen aan verschillende rapporten, zoals onze jaarlijkse Klimaat- en Energieverkenning (KEV), en de analyse van verkiezingsprogramma’s. Daarnaast heb je een aansturende rol in de verdere ontwikkeling van de rapportage- en evaluatiesystematiek. Om je werk goed te kunnen doen heb je veel contact met interne en externe collega’s en andere betrokkenen; denk aan het management van het PBL, beleidsmakers, vertegenwoordigers van belangenorganisaties en onderzoekers van universiteiten en andere kennisinstellingen.



Verdere invulling van de functie doen we graag in overleg en is afhankelijk van jouw eigen vakinhoudelijke achtergrond en interesse.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
* Je hebt een afgeronde academische opleiding op het gebied van Environmental Sciences, Agricultural Sciences, Sustainable Development, (Agricultural) Economics of een aanverwant terrein, bij voorkeur afgesloten met een promotie.
* Je hebt minstens 5 jaar ervaring met relevant onderzoek in multidisciplinaire onderzoeksteams, waarbij je ook ervaring hebt opgedaan met het leiden van projecten.
* Je hebt ervaring en affiniteit met kwantitatieve analyses op basis van modellering (bij voorkeur ervaring met Python en/of R). Ervaring met GIS-analyses is een pre.
* Je hebt ervaring met het uitvoeren van ex ante en ex post beleidsevaluaties en -verkenningen.
* Je hebt kennis van het nationale en Europese landbouwbeleid en de ketenafhankelijkheden in de landbouwsector en bijbehorende beleidsvraagstukken; je hebt daarnaast kennis van en affiniteit met vraagstukken rond emissies van stikstof en broeikasgassen in de landbouwsector. Je hebt bij voorkeur een netwerk met relevante experts en beleidsmakers.
* Je hebt gevoel voor de dynamische beleidscontext waarin het Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving opereert en de verschillende maatschappelijke belangen die spelen rond landbouw.


Je herkent jezelf in de volgende eigenschappen of zou deze willen ontwikkelen:


* Je bent conceptueel sterk en bent in staat complexe inhoudelijke vraagstukken te vertalen in beleidsrelevante analyses, rapporten en boodschappen.
* Je werkt graag met cijfers en werkt nauwgezet en traceerbaar.
* Het spreekt je aan om te werken op het snijvlak van wetenschap en beleid.
* Je kunt goed plannen en organiseren, en bent in staat om onderzoeksvragen in heldere werkafspraken te vertalen, zowel intern als extern. Je weet hierbij de juiste partijen binnen en buiten het instituut te raadplegen en in te zetten voor het beantwoorden van de onderzoeksvragen.
* Je wisselt kennis, informatie en ideeën uit met collega’s en vraagt actief feedback op eigen ideeën. Je ondersteunt collega’s gevraagd en ongevraagd bij de werkzaamheden.
* Je bent vaak verantwoordelijk voor de voortgang van het onderzoek. Je stuurt tijdig bij en informeert tijdig leidinggevenden bij problemen of tegenvallers.
* Je hebt goede schrijfvaardigheden en goede mondelinge vaardigheden, in het Nederlands en het Engels.


Voldoe je (nog) niet aan de functie-eisen of heb je aangepaste werkomstandigheden nodig? Licht dan in je motivatiebrief toe hoe jij een bijdrage kunt leveren aan onze organisatie en wat je daarvoor (van ons) nodig hebt. We kijken graag hoe we een match kunnen maken waarbij jij goed tot je recht komt.

-----------------


Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is offering a fully funded, four-year PhD-position, as part of the European Research Council (ERC) project “Where are the Humanities in the Medical Humanities? How Comics Can Improve Healthcare Training, Practice, and Dissemination” (2024-2029), led by Dr. Erin La Cour at the Faculty of Humanities. **The start date of the position is February 1, 2025.**


How can healthcare become more attentive to individual patient experiences? How can we *talk with* and *talk back to* practitioners and systems? What tools are needed to open productive dialogue?


This ERC project will critically elaborate the benefits of further integrating insights from the Humanities in the Critical Medical and Health Humanities by examining and expanding discourse on Graphic Medicine. A flourishing field that utilizes theoretical and artistic research practices in productive reciprocal exchange, Graphic Medicine is attentive to how the study and production of comics about health and healthcare echo calls within the Critical Medical and Health Humanities for the urgent need for different understandings and expressions of illness and disability than those found in conventional medical discourse. Focused on bottom-up, experiential knowledge, Graphic Medicine promotes comics as an important medium to depict interactions between individuals, their families and carers, a wide array of healthcare workers, and healthcare systems as scenes of intercultural, interdiscursive, and intergenerational encounter.


Through cross-national, cross-cultural, and cross-linguistic analyses of Graphic Medicine, from healthcare education to online information, and from individual artistic practices to collaborations between comics artists and healthcare institutions, this project will critically and comprehensively evaluate and develop the aims, current applications, and potential of Graphic Medicine across five individual subprojects. In so doing, it will also advance an understanding of creative practices as capable of critiquing and producing theory, will develop the discourse of what counts as healthcare knowledge, and will contribute to the aims of the Critical Medical and Health Humanities to offer new insights for healthcare training, practice, and dissemination.


**Graphic Medicine Online**


The PhD subproject, Graphic Medicine Online, will contribute to the overall aims of the ERC project through a comparative analysis of available online information on Graphic Medicine in English, Dutch, and French. Utilizing (and modifying) open-access data crawling software to aggregate available online information about Graphic Medicine in these three languages, including primary texts (comics) and secondary texts (theoretical and popular articles, blog posts, etc.), the PhD will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate how the discourse and practice of Graphic Medicine travels and shifts across national, cultural, and/or linguistic contexts. In so doing, it will create a comprehensive overview of Graphic Medicine in and across these three languages, and, through developing an online database of the project’s findings, will create an unprecedented resource for the advancement of research in the field.


*Key outputs of the PhD subproject:*


* An open-access and keyword searchable database of Graphic Medicine comics and scholarly and publicly-oriented articles on Graphic Medicine in English, Dutch, and French, including works translated into these languages, built from the aggregated information the PhD has collected, assessed, and keyword tagged (e.g. country of origin, language, translation, topic(s), perspective(s), discipline(s), target audience(s), source reliability, etc.). \*The database will be supported by a web programmer who will assist in preparing the backend database for a frontend website.
* A PhD dissertation on the project’s research methods and findings. Through a discussion of the project’s development of digital methods to create ways of finding, scraping, tagging, comparing, and translating the mentions of Graphic Medicine online in the three languages, and a visualization of the crawler’s trace to show the nodes of research and discourse, the PhD will develop theory through its method. The project will also seek to answer how much information is available and to which audience, how the discourse travels, and what shifts in meaning arise through translation into different national, cultural, and/or linguistic contexts. As such, the PhD dissertation will contribute to the field an engagement with the need for greater access to and dissemination of Graphic Medicine and the importance of accessibility to reliable healthcare information.


**Your duties**


* conduct research for and complete a PhD dissertation, as outlined above
* create an open-access and keyword searchable database of Graphic Medicine, as outlined above
* publish three (individually or co-authored) peer-reviewed journal articles or book chapters
* present research at national and international conferences

Netflix is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with 278 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

 **The Role**


Our mission at Netflix is to connect global stories with global audiences. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.


Recently, Netflix has expanded its entertainment offering to include Live content, like The Roast of Tom Brady Comedy Special, the SAG Awards ceremony, and The Netflix Slam tennis match. Our scope will grow to include premium live entertainment with our growing Live content catalogue, including WWE, NFL, and more.


Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips. This is made possible because Netflix UI is a thriving learning machine where Artwork & Video assets are personalized via reinforcement learning.


Europe is a significant center for our broader Studio and Creative Production teams. We’re looking for a Senior Analytics Engineer based in our Amsterdam office to join our growing European team. In this role, you would serve as a trusted partner for regional Creative Production leadership. Given this data & insights rich landscape, we are looking for a highly motivated Senior Analytics Engineer to partner with business teams and product managers to empower how we create Artwork and Trailers. This is an opportunity for you to have direct influence on strategic decisions through technical and business thought partnership that will ultimately shape promotional content.

**As a Senior Analytics Engineer in this space, you will…**

* Be a strategic partner for Studio & Creative Production teams: identify critical analytical problems and apply an entrepreneurial mindset to find innovative solutions with data
* Being the lead analytics engineer partnering with our Product Creative Studio partners who are responsible for the promotional assets for Live content experiences.
* Drive the direction of your work, developing solutions that span from scrappy code and prototype tools to high-visibility dashboards and analyses for Studio & Creative Production leadership
* Spearhead the creation of new metrics that impact decision-making
* Collaborate with Data Scientists & Data Engineers to source data from new systems and strengthen our foundational data models
* Become a regional expert on all things Studio Data Science & Engineering, helping educate and connect regional offices to existing data solutions

**You are…**

* A strong communicator who can develop and deepen strong relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders. You have experience partnering closely with executive leadership, with a proven track record of influencing strategic decisions through data.
* Comfortable with ambiguity; able to thrive with minimal oversight and process. You connect the dots across business needs and independently drive projects forward.
* A senior analytics professional with extensive experience across data wrangling, analysis, reporting, and visualization.
* An expert in a data-oriented programming language (e.g. SQL, Python, R, Scala, etc.) and intuitive dashboard/visualization design (e.g. Tableau)
* Proficient in ETL and data warehousing best practices and core statistics concepts (e.g. hypothesis testing)
* Adept at working across different cultures on a globally-distributed team, with core working hours in the Central European and GMT time zones

**Culture**


You will have the opportunity to impact the business in a meaningful way, working alongside smart people who love to solve hard problems, and who not only expect but also foster high performance. You will have the freedom to innovate, solve interesting problems and influence decision-making in a fast paced, exciting environment. You can learn more about the Netflix culture at jobs.netflix.com/culture.

*“AFEP is een unieke plek: dicht op de politiek, diep in de inhoud en een hecht team”* – Karlijn Kersten (afdelingshoofd)



Stagelopen in het hart van de financieel-economische besluitvorming van Nederland. Dat doe je bij de directie Algemene Financiële en Economische Politiek (AFEP) van het ministerie van Financiën. Hier werken we aan de belangrijkste economische en politieke dossiers. Een evenwichtige koopkrachtontwikkeling voor huishoudens, de verschuivende vermogensverdeling en de rol van belastingen hierin, de omvangrijke opgave om Nederland klimaatneutraal te maken, goed werkende ondersteuning voor mensen met schulden: het is een kleine greep uit de actuele onderwerpen die ons bezighouden.


**Jouw stage**  

Als stagiair bij AFEP help jij ons om duidelijke en bruikbare economische adviezen te geven aan de politiek. Dit doe je door middel van analyses en onderzoek die besluitvorming ondersteunen, maar je krijgt natuurlijk ook ruimte om eigen initiatieven te ontwikkelen en verschillende hoeken van politiek Den Haag te verkennen.



In deze stage help je het team dat met een economische bril kijkt naar belastingen. Belastingen financieren de overheid en maken daarmee onze ambities voor de zorg, infrastructuur en sociale zekerheid mogelijk. Maar hoe bepalen we wat ieders juiste bijdrage is? De vraag ‘wie betaalt wat’ is de rode draad in het gesprek binnen het ministerie van Financiën sinds zijn vroegste bestaan. Jij helpt ons de discussie hierover naar een hoger plan te tillen door inzichtelijk te maken hoe belastingen verdeeld worden over verschillende doelgroepen en hoe ze de werking van de economie raken. Daarnaast is er ruimte om bij te dragen aan vraagstukken die tijdens jouw stage actueel zijn. Dit kan over belastingen gaan, maar ook over andere uiteenlopende onderwerpen, afhankelijk van de actualiteit. Onze stagiairs hebben eerder bijvoorbeeld gewerkt aan onderwijsbeleid, klimaatbeleid en coronasteun en hun onderzoek is gebruikt in de politieke besluitvorming en gepubliceerd in vakbladen, zoals ESB. Je stage is dus een mix tussen langer lopende verdieping en politieke actualiteit.



Natuurlijk doe je dit niet alleen. Tijdens jouw stage maak je onderdeel uit van een jonge en hechte directie. De sfeer bij AFEP is informeel en gedreven. Je krijgt veel verantwoordelijkheid, maar ook goede begeleiding en veel kansen om te leren.



Om het meeste uit deze stage te kunnen halen, is het prettig als je bedreven bent in analytisch werk, geïnteresseerd in maatschappelijke vraagstukken en een goed oog hebt voor politiek-bestuurlijke besluitvorming. Tijdens je stage krijg je uiteraard de kans om al deze vaardigheden verder te ontwikkelen en in de praktijk te brengen. Bovenal vind je het leuk om naar creatieve oplossingen te zoeken, leg je makkelijk contacten en werk je samen met anderen om jouw werk verder te brengen.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
* Je bevindt je in de laatste fase van je wo-bachelor, of volgt een master, die een economisch of maatschappelijk karakter combineert met kwantitatieve vaardigheden. Ervaring met Excel vereist, ervaring met R een pre.
* Je bent in staat om structuur aan te brengen in complexe materie en beschikt over een goed analytisch denkvermogen.
* Je hebt interesse in politiek-bestuurlijke krachtvelden en wilt graag leren over de verschillende rollen en belangen in de politiek. Interesse in maatschappelijke vraagstukken is dan ook een must.
* Je spreekt en schrijft goed Nederlands.
* Je bent minimaal vijf maanden ten minste vier dagen per week beschikbaar. De sterke voorkeur gaat uit naar zes maanden voltijds. Over jouw startdatum kan worden overlegd.


Ben je enthousiast geworden om samen met je wellicht toekomstige collega’s te werken aan de puzzels voor een beter Nederland? Dan maken we graag kennis met je. Eerst nog even verder praten? Neem dan contact op met: Tim Mulder – [email protected] of Sam Peeperkorn – [email protected].

**Ministerie van Financiën**
----------------------------



**Samen werken aan een financieel gezond Nederland**  

Het werk van het ministerie van Financiën gaat over meer dan cijfers en geld alleen. Het gaat over mensen zoals jij en ik. Mensen met verwachtingen, zorgen, vragen, dromen en plannen. We rekenen bijvoorbeeld allemaal op financiering voor goede zorg en goed onderwijs. Op duidelijkheid over belastingtarieven en op betrouwbare banken en verzekeraars, in Nederland en daarbuiten. En we rekenen allemaal op duidelijkheid over exportregels en wat we wel en niet mee mogen nemen vanuit de vakantiebestemming.



Het ministerie van Financiën luistert naar wat er speelt in de samenleving van vandaag en heeft aandacht voor hoe Nederlanders hun toekomst zien. Met die kennis en inzichten leggen we samen met andere ministeries en binnen ons internationale netwerk de juiste verbindingen en brengen we Nederland verder. We zorgen ervoor dat Nederland en onze economie klaar zijn voor de steeds sneller veranderende wereld van morgen. Op alle fronten. Dat gaat niet vanzelf. En natuurlijk is daar ook geld voor nodig. Dat geld brengen burgers en bedrijven via belastingen bijeen, en verdeelt de overheid over zaken die we als samenleving belangrijk vinden. Daarvoor moeten er keuzes worden gemaakt en worden ingegrepen als dat nodig is. Om ons land financieel gezond te houden, moet onze economie namelijk in balans blijven en tegelijk ook ruimte krijgen om te groeien.



Samen zorgen we ervoor dat er in Nederland kansen zijn voor welvaart en groei voor iedereen, vandaag, morgen en daarna. Samen werken we aan een financieel gezond Nederland.  

  

Onze kernwaarden: integer, deskundig, duidelijk, durf en samenwerken zijn leidend voor ons gedrag en geven ons een gezamenlijke taal, waarmee we onderling bespreekbaar maken wat we doen en hoe we dat doen.

Ben jij die Data Scientist die het leuk vindt om modellen en algoritmes te onderzoeken en ontwikkelen? Of houd je je liever bezig met het innoveren, valideren en toepassen hiervan? Of ben je bedreven in het in productie brengen van deze modellen?



Wat ga je doen?  

Voor de nationale veiligheid is het cruciaal dat inlichtingenteams van de Algemene Inlichtingen en Veiligheidsdienst (AIVD) en Militaire Inlichtingen en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD) snel relevante informatie kunnen vinden in uiteenlopende datastromen. Het verwerken van de informatie die wordt verworven gebeurt uiteraard binnen de kaders van de Wet op de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten (Wiv2017).  

Het Data Science team heeft de ambitie om Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning (AI/ML) -oplossingen te ontwikkelen, valideren en productionaliseren. Zo stellen wij de inlichtingenteams en operationele afdelingen van de diensten in staat om deze datastromen te analyseren.

* Als Applied Data Scientist valideer en verbeter je nieuwe en bestaande AI/ML-technieken om kort-cyclisch dienstbrede vraagstukken het hoofd te bieden, en toon je de bruikbaarheid en inzetbaarheid van proofs-of-concept;
* Als AI/ML Engineer optimaliseer je algoritmes en modellen voor de productie en het onderhoud hiervan en ontwikkel je een complex high performance framework dat in de organisatie wordt ingezet bij het (realtime) verrijken van data in processing, applicaties en andere toepassingen;
* In deze functie werk je samen met de operationele en inlichtingenteams van de AIVD en MIVD, nationale en internationale partners uit de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsketen en met verscheidene (technische) experts;
* In al jouw werkzaamheden houd je scherp zicht op wat kan en past binnen de Wiv2017.


Wat krijg je daarvoor terug?  

Jouw werk is van cruciaal belang voor de veiligheid van Nederland. We bieden je een unieke werkomgeving waar je omringd bent door technisch specialisten uit de meest uiteenlopende disciplines. Je werkt op een plek die je nergens anders vindt en waar diepgaand aan (en met) algoritmes, modellen, data en techniek wordt gewerkt. Je hebt te maken met een set computationele uitdagingen binnen de grote verscheidenheid aan data en krijgt een interessant takenpakket onder je hoede waar veel ruimte is voor jouw creativiteit, nieuwsgierigheid en scherpe analytische vaardigheden.

-------------------


  
Binnen het Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM) ontwikkelt de Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) zich tot een sterke crisisorganisatie. Bij de LFI werk je nauw samen met ketenpartners binnen en buiten het RIVM in een politiek-bestuurlijke context. Een uitdagende functie waarin jij jouw flexibiliteit, wendbaarheid en talent om snel tot oplossingen te komen optimaal kunt inzetten. De data analisten maken deel uit van het LFI datalab. LFI Datalab focust op het verzamelen en visualiseren van kerncijfers en KPI’s over de medisch-operationele processen voor de LFI. Als data analist speel je een cruciale rol in de informatieketen door data te analyseren en inzichten te genereren, binnen een maatschappelijke context. Deze analyses ondersteunen de ontwikkeling van informatiemodellen en functionaliteiten, zo maak jij het verschil.

**Wat ga je doen**


Je begint je dag als LFI data analist om 9:00 op het RIVM-kantoor in Bilthoven of thuis met een stand-up meeting. Hierbij worden de voortgang en knelpunten van huidige projecten en de algemene situatie binnen het LFI Datalab besproken. Daarna ga je verder met de ontwikkeling van verschillende soorten informatieproducten, van een dashboard dat het lab landschap van Nederland in kaart brengt tot het visualiseren van real-time GGD-informatie. Tijdens de pauze is er tijd voor ontspanning, zoals een boswandeling of een gezellige lunch in de kantine. Vervolgens neem je deel aan verschillende meetings, waaronder intakegesprekken voor nieuwe informatieproducten met andere LFI-functies en sessies met de RIVM IV organisatie om het benodigde dataplatform juist in te richten. De dag sluit je af met het bijwerken van e-mails en het voorbereiden van kennisdelingssessies met ketenpartners zoals GGDGHOR of VWS. Zo draagt de data-analist bij aan de voorbereiding van de bestrijding van een eventuele toekomstige pandemie, waarbij de juiste stuur- en verantwoordingsrapportages cruciaal zijn.

**Een greep uit je taken en werkzaamheden:**

* als trekker maak je een plan van aanpak voor het verkrijgen van cruciale data ter ondersteuning van onze bedrijfsprocessen, en bewaak je nauwgezet de voortgang van projecten.
* als bruggenbouwer tussen business en IV-organisatie overstijg je afdelingen en breng je informatievraagstukken tot leven door samen met de business functionele vragen te definiëren en oplossingsrichtingen te ontwerpen. Of het nu gaat om het ontwikkelen van nieuwe producten of het matchen van bestaande instrumenten, jij bent in staat een goede oplossing te bieden.
* jij bent de drijvende kracht achter het verzamelen, prepareren, controleren en analyseren van data, waarmee we ons werk verbeteren en het maatschappelijk effect vergroten. Dankzij jouw inzicht en expertise kunnen we vroegtijdig trends signaleren en risicoprofielen opzetten om proactief te handelen en strategische en tactische beslissingen nemen;
* jij ontwikkelt dynamische dashboards en rapporten die onze organisatie voorzien van cruciale stuurinformatie.
* jij bent essentieel bij het implementeren van onze datalabfunctie, waarbij je op tactisch niveau meedenkt over de visie en daarnaast procesbeschrijvingen en werkwijzen vormgeeft;
* met jouw effectief stakeholdermanagement op verschillende niveaus, definieer je samen met de business de juiste functionele vragen en identificeer je passende datasets, terwijl je nauw samenwerkt met technische experts.
* je draagt actief bij aan het versterken van onze kennispositie en zorgt ervoor dat onze organisatie voorzien is van relevante informatie om onze medische operationele processen te ondersteunen.

**Waar staat de LFI voor?**


De Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) is een nieuw organisatieonderdeel van het RIVM. Het is de missie van de LFI om samen met haar ketenpartners de impact van de volgende pandemie op de volksgezondheid zo klein mogelijk te houden. Bij een infectieziektecrisis die een landelijke aanpak vereist, zorgt de LFI voor snelle opschaling en centrale aansturing van de medisch-operationele processen bij de GGD’en, zoals testen en vaccineren.


Om samen met de ketenpartners goed voorbereid te zijn, voert de LFI regie op onder andere het opleiden, trainen en oefenen van medewerkers en het maken van afspraken over informatievoorziening en snelle beschikbaarheid van grote aantallen medewerkers. Door de sterke verbinding met de GGD’en en het Centrum Infectieziektebestrijding (CIb) van het RIVM, kan de LFI snel opschalen bij een infectieziektecrisis.


De implementatie van de LFI is eind 2023 gestart en is naar verwachting eind 2026 voltooid. In deze periode geeft de LFI samen met GGD’en, andere onderdelen van het RIVM en het ministerie van VWS concrete invulling aan de ontwerpen voor onder andere aansturing, opgeschaalde diagnostiek en behandelen, grootschalig klantcontact, logistiek, scenario-ontwerp, crisiscommunicatie, informatiemanagement, inkoop, facilitaire diensten en financiën.

Bel of app je?

*De einddatum van deze vacature is langer dan gemiddeld, dit heeft te maken met de vakantieperiode. De sluitingsdatum is zondag 1 september. In de eerste weken van september zullen de gesprekken plaatsvinden.*

**Faculteit/Dienst:** Faculteit Economie & Bedrijfskunde
**Opleidingsniveau:** Master
**Functie type:** Promotieplaats
**Sluitingsdatum:** 1 november 2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13308  

Are you eager to apply cutting-edge stochastics and optimization, develop innovative algorithms, and tackle real-life challenges associated with improving accessibility to healthcare in developing countries? The Business Analytics Section at the Amsterdam Business School (University of Amsterdam) invites applications for a PhD position in Stochastics and Optimization. We are looking for highly motivated PhD candidates who aspire to excel in the international academic arena at the highest level.  

**Background**
The *Analytics for a Better World* institute at the University of Amsterdam applies and develop advanced analytics methods to contribute to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. They had and have several projects in developing countries on improving accessibility to healthcare services. Examples are: optimization of primary healthcare centers in Timor-Leste, stroke centers in Vietnam, covid-19 centers in Nepal, vaccination clinics in Kenya, and water wells in Sudan. Good geospatial accessibility to healthcare services is extremely important for good health. Many low- and middle-income countries do not satisfy the healthcare accessibility goals defined by the United Nations. Currently half of the world’s population do not have access to the healthcare they need. To improve geospatial accessibility to healthcare services in low- and middle-income countries, new mathematical optimization and stochastics techniques have to be developed. The focus in this project is on minimizing the waiting time to the services. The methods will be applied and tested in cooperation with NGOs as Amref, Red Cross, WHO, and World Bank.  


**What are you going to do?**  


This PhD research initiative aims to develop queueing models to model waiting time to healthcare services in developing countries, and then develop optimization methods to solve the final nonlinear optimization model. Moreover, it could be the case that discrete-event simulation is needed to calculate the waiting time. One of the options could be to use Machine Learning for Model Learning. Moreover, the aim is to combine the facility location problem with the capacity problem (queueing models). More precisely, you will develop an optimization method to optimize both the number and locations of the facilities, and the capacities, such that the overall time to treatment (travel time + waiting time) is minimized and the costs are less than the available budget. Our partnerships with many NGO’s provide us with access to pertinent data for this research. Visits to healthcare services in one or more of the developing countries are possible, but are not compulsory.  

  

**Tasks and responsibilities**
The PhD student will work in close collaboration with the supervisory team, the *Analytics for a Better World* team, additional academic staff, and NGOs. The responsibilities will encompass:
* Developing and applying advanced queueing models to model waiting times for healthcare facilities in developing countries;
* Developing and applying optimization techniques to simultaneously optimize the locations and capacity of healthcare facilities;
* developing open-access software tools (such as R and Python packages or C++ libraries) for applying the newly developed algorithms/models and techniques to real-world applications;
* working in close collaboration with *Analytics for a Better World* and NGOs to understand the challenge and apply the developed techniques in practice;
* writing up findings for publication in prestigious Operations Research journals;
* presenting research findings at leading conferences;
* attending classes (including those offered by LNMB) and seminars (including those offered at other universities) to further develop thinking and research skills;
* conducting teaching (to a limited degree), including undergraduate tutorials and the supervision of BSc dissertation projects.

  

  

**Your profile**  

* Master’s degree (preferably a Research Master´s or MPhil degree) in Stochastics, Operations Research, Business Analytics, Mathematics, Econometrics, or a related field;
* a strong background in modern Stochastics and Optimization;
* excellent programming skills in one or more of the following languages: R, Python, C, C++, and a strong willingness to develop these skills further;
* excellent communication, presentation and writing skills;
* an excellent command of English, ideally with experience writing for a scientific audience.

The past decade has brought large progress in identifying the prokaryotic origins of eukaryotes. In this development, our group discovered the Asgard archaea, eukaryotes’ closest prokaryotic relatives, marking an important inflection point.  

  

Analyses of accumulating genome data yielded insights into which genomic changes contributed to the origin of the eukaryotic cell. Yet, for many key eukaryotic genes, we still don’t know how they came about. Similarly, how more recent eukaryotic lineages evolve is an open question, particularly for eukaryotic microbes, which dominate the eukaryotic tree of life, yet are poorly studied.  

  

As a PhD student in our lab, you will work in a stimulating environment. We are at the forefront of unravelling the deep origins of eukaryotic cells, and expand our explorations of the understudied world of eukaryotic microbes. You will utilize cutting-edge bioinformatics tools to trace the evolution of proteins and genomes. As a result, you will deepen our understanding of the origins and diversification of eukaryotic cellular complexity. You will have the opportunity to pursue your own research questions and implement your ideas.  

  

**Your responsibilities include:*** implementing state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools to scrutinize the evolutionary histories of eukaryotic proteins;
* interpreting large-scale evolutionary analyses in the framework of eukaryotic cellular complexity and diversity;
* contributing to teaching in our courses and supervising BSc and MSc thesis students.

**You will work here**  

This PhD position is embedded within the chair Laboratory of Microbiology, and member of the Microbial Evolution (MicEvo) team, which is led by Prof. dr. Thijs Ettema.

* there is a strong focus on vitality and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
* a fixed December bonus of 8.3%;
* excellent pension scheme.


In addition to these first-rate employee benefits, you will receive a fully funded PhD position and you will be offered a course program tailored to your needs and the research team.  

  

The gross salary for the first year is € 2.770 - per month rising to € 3.539,- in the fourth year in according to the Collective Labour Agreements for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU) (scale P).

De Algemene Rekenkamer doet onderzoek naar uiteenlopende maatschappelijke onderwerpen. Bijvoorbeeld gelijke kansen in het mbo, de werking van het Nederlandse witwasbeleid of de energietransitie. Kom jij ons team van data-specialisten versterken met kwantitatief onderzoek naar deze of andere onderwerpen? Lees dan verder.


**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Op basis van je ruime ervaring met kwantitatief beleidsonderzoek lever je een bijdrage aan het onderzoek naar het functioneren en presteren van de rijksoverheid. Bijvoorbeeld door kansen voor doelmatigheidsonderzoeken waarin data-analyse een grote rol speelt te herkennen en deze te vertalen in onderzoeksvoorstellen. Je werkt hierin samen met collega’s met minder statistische kennis (medeonderzoekers, maar ook onze bestuurders). Je voert gesprekken met mensen die werken bij overheidsorganisaties om te inventariseren welke mogelijkheden en beperkingen er zijn voor data-analyse in het onderzoek en gebruikt deze inzichten voor het opstellen van een haalbaar plan van aanpak. Vervolgens zorg je ook tijdens de uitvoering van het onderzoek voor de succesvolle uitvoering van de geplande analyses en stuurt wanneer dat nodig is bij. Tot slot weet je de complexe uitkomsten te vertalen naar duidelijke aanbevelingen voor bijvoorbeeld de onderzochte partijen, Tweede Kamerleden en/of verantwoordelijk bewindspersonen.


**Over de Algemene Rekenkamer**
-------------------------------


Wij onderzoeken of de rijksoverheid zinnig, zuinig en zorgvuldig omgaat met publiek geld. Het is onze wettelijke taak de inkomsten en uitgaven van het Rijk te controleren. Op Verantwoordingsdag, de derde woensdag in mei, rapporteren we aan het parlement wat onze bevindingen zijn. Op basis van ons oordeel kan het parlement besluiten of het decharge verleent aan het kabinet. Daarnaast brengen we rapporten uit over onderzoeken naar beleid van ministers. Zo helpen we Kamerleden te bepalen of dat beleid werkt.

**Het team**
------------


Binnen de Algemene Rekenkamer houdt de Data Hub (ca 10 fte en onderdeel van de directie Audit & Data) zich bezig met het bevorderen van data-analyse binnen de organisatie en in onderzoek.


Het team bestaat uit kwantitatief onderzoekers en business informatie analisten met verschillende disciplinaire achtergronden. Voor dit team zoeken we een kwantitatief onderzoeker beleidsonderzoek met ervaring in het toepassen van kwantitatieve methoden en technieken van onderzoek om inzicht te krijgen in de effectiviteit en efficiëntie van beleid. Samen zorgen we voor:


* De ondersteuning van onderzoeksteams met de voorbereiding en uitvoering van onderzoeksprojecten waarin kwantitatieve methoden een belangrijk onderdeel vormen. We geven sturing aan (deel)projecten. En maken daarbij gebruik van wetenschappelijk verantwoorde werkwijzen.
* Methodologisch advies in de ontwerpfase van nieuwe onderzoeksprojecten. We zijn proactief en brengen onze methodische kennis ook goed over aan collega’s die over minder kwantitatieve kennis beschikken.
* Het vergroten van datavaardigheden van collega’s binnen de Algemene Rekenkamer. Denk aan het helpen van een collega met code review of het geven van cursussen en ontwikkelen van ondersteunende materialen. Maar ook aan het organiseren van kennisuitwisseling, zoals deep dives binnen de organisatie en met nationale en internationale partners.

Daarnaast ben je ondersteunend en verbindend, met een sterk vermogen om advies te geven. Je kunt zowel zelfstandig als in teamverband werken. Je hebt een stevige persoonlijkheid en uitstekende mondelinge en schriftelijke communicatieve vaardigheden.  

  

Specifieke functie eisen:


* Je hebt affiniteit en ervaring met data-analyses en weet registratieve (o.a. boekhoud) systemen conceptueel snel met elkaar te verbinden en data uit deze te vertalen naar bruikbare inzichten op strategisch en tactisch niveau.
* Je beschikt over excellente Excel vaardigheden. Modellen opstellen met behulp van PowerBI of PowerQuery, PowerPivot en af en toe wat VBA, is jouw ding.
* Ervaring met/ kennis van SQL of R, is een pluspunt.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Kan jij niet wachten om lege schappen te voorkomen, food waste te verminderen en de efficiëntie te verbeteren van de gaafste boodschappen-operatie van Nederland? Zet jij onze bulk aan data om in waardevolle analyses en word jij enthousiast van het geven van goede, data-gedreven adviezen aan onze collega’s? Heb jij een passie voor retail? Dan zoeken wij jou als onze nieuwe Data Analist binnen AH Technology!

 **Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst Operations ontwikkel je oplossingen waarbij data (zoals bijvoorbeeld de data van winkel leveringen) wordt gebruikt om complexe vraagstukken te beantwoorden en de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van deze oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk je vanuit de nieuwste Data Analytics / Data Science technieken.  

Je beweegt makkelijk tussen IT/Data Science en de day-to-day business, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data-analytics toepassingen. In het Operations-domein ondersteun je onze winkels, supply chain en e-commerce Operations met analytics en data Science-oplossingen. Zo maken we onze operatie nog efficiënter en duurzamer met integrale supply chain-oplossingen en operationele procesoptimalisaties zoals routing, slotting en planning. Daarnaast helpen we voedselverspilling te verminderen door het maken van een geavanceerde demand forecast op winkel- en productniveau, of het bepalen van een dynamische korting voor artikelen die over de houdbaarheidsdatum dreigen te gaan.

 **Maak impact als Data Analyst door:**  

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies m.b.t. de operatie van e-commerce, winkels en supply chain
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse-aanpakken; je gaat creatief op zoek naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* Jouw verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen van data-analyses naar bruikbare inzichten
 **Dit breng je mee**  

Als grootste supermarkt van Nederland vullen we met onze 100.000 medewerkers dagelijks zo'n 5 miljoen borden. En als het aan ons ligt, doen we dat binnenkort ook samen met jou als onze Data Analyst Operations. Zeker als je de broodnodige proactiviteit en resultaatgerichtheid naar Albert Heijn meebrengt. We zoeken gedreven analisten, die sterk in hun schoenen staan en waar de ambitie van af spat. Ook heb je  

* Een afgeronde WO-opleiding met data- en/of statistische basis zoals Econometrie, Operations Research, Wiskunde, Informatica of Business Analytics
* Circa 0 – 2 jaar werkervaring als Analyst of equivalent
* Ervaring met werken met grote databases (SQL / PySpark)
* Ervaring met het oplossen van business vraagstukken met data analytics en/of data science technieken d.m.v. Python / R. Dit is een must!
* Ervaring met object georiënteerd programmeren (Python/Javascript) is een pre
* Ervaring met visualisatie tools zoals Power BI is een pre
 **En, niet onbelangrijk, ben je:**  

* Proactief; je geeft zowel gevraagd als ongevraagd advies
* Sterk in het adviseren van de business en meenemen van stakeholders
* Communicatief sterk; je weet complexe informatie aan een niet-technisch publiek uit te leggen
  

Bij AH Technology willen we blijven groeien. Dat kan alleen als jij ook met ons mee blijft groeien. Hiervoor krijg je “Best in Class” begeleiding en toegang tot inspirerende opleidingen om je eigen ontwikkeling en loopbaan vorm te geven. Terwijl we met elkaar bouwen aan ons merk én aan jouw loopbaan, kan je rekenen op (op basis van 40 uur per week):  

* Een jaarsalaris tussen de €49k en €65k(incl. vakantiegeld)
* 25,5 vakantiedagen en 19,5 adv-dagen(ja in totaal 45 vrije dagen), met de mogelijkheid om je adv-dagen te laten uitbetalen. Zo kan jij genieten van jouw welverdiende vakantie
* 8% Vakantiegeld, reiskostenvergoeding en een gegarandeerde winstuitkering
* Goede pensioenopbouw
* Een laptop en telefoon
* Toegang tot onze AH Data Academy met veel trainingen op zowel hard als soft skills, jezelf blijven ontwikkelen vinden wij namelijk erg belangrijk
* Een uitdagende functie met de mogelijkheid om te werken met grote hoeveelheden data (koopgedrag, assortiment etc)
* Een gemotiveerd en groeiend team dat het analytische geweten van de organisatie vormt
* Een data-gedreven organisatie, waar de stakeholders het belang van data-gedreven werken erkennen
* Leuke collega’s, gezellige uitjes en een ambitieuze en informele bedrijfscultuur

Wij bieden jou een kijkje onder de motorkap bij een grote variëteit aan organisaties. Heb je zin om jezelf te ontwikkelen in een jong, gedreven team? Dan zouden wij graag samen met jou in de rol van Business & IT consultant onze IT-Services discipline verder uitbouwen!**  

  

Wij geloven in: samen maken we toekomst! Dagelijks werken we met elkaar samen voor onze klanten in de Brainportregio. We werken vanuit één vestiging in Eindhoven, onze fonkelnieuwe werk- en ontmoetingsplek aan de Beemdstraat. Wij zijn een jonge, professionele adviesorganisatie waar je je eigen carrière kunt vormgeven. Jouw persoonlijke ontwikkeling staat centraal.

**Team IT-Services**


Organisaties beschikken over veel data, maar gebruiken deze vaak nog niet optimaal. Ze hebben dan ook behoefte aan advies en ondersteuning om digitale ontwikkelingen te omarmen en zo meer inzicht te krijgen en daarmee organisaties verder te professionaliseren. Wij onderscheiden ons door vraagstukken vanuit verschillende invalshoeken te bezien door intensief samen te werken met collega’s uit andere teams binnen Joanknecht. Daarbij willen we de echte vraag van onze opdrachtgever begrijpen en zorgen dat het hulpmiddel (de IT) daar perfect op aansluit. Onze uitdaging is daarom om zowel de IT als de business kant te begrijpen, en wij denken dat je dit het beste leert in de praktijk.

**Wat ga je doen als Business & IT consultant?**


In de rol van Business & IT consultant ben je werkzaam in een jong, gedreven team. Je werkt voor uitdagende klanten in diverse branches. Je gaat voornamelijk data visualisatie oplossingen in de praktijk brengen. Denk hierbij aan het ontwerpen, modelleren, bouwen, aanpassen en beheren van dashboards en datamodellen in BI tools (met name Microsoft PowerBI). Hiervoor ga je vraagstukken ophalen bij klanten en conceptueel nadenken over oplossingen met het team. Je bent dus zowel data-engineer, als data-analist. Om met elkaar de beste oplossingen te kunnen blijven bieden aan onze opdrachtgever blijven we continue innoveren en experimenten met nieuwe technieken.


Je wordt verantwoordelijk voor het bedenken en realiseren van betrouwbare oplossingen waarop klanten kunnen vertrouwen. Om dat te bereiken hanteren wij een praktische maar ook creatieve aanpak. Daarbij werken wij met name met financiële data, maar ook met operationele gegevens. Daarom verwachten we dat je ervoor openstaat om jezelf op het financiële, operationele en IT-vlak te ontwikkelen. Op termijn kun je het team aansturen dat de oplossingen voor klanten bouwt.

**Hoe werken we bij Joanknecht?**


We werken voor onze klanten samen in multidisciplinaire teams door de hele organisatie heen. Voor een specifieke opdracht werk je vaak met collega’s vanuit jouw team IT-Services. Deze samenwerking is gebaseerd op een open cultuur, ruimte geven aan elkaar en snel verantwoordelijkheden krijgen. En die mag je dan ook nemen. Ook over je eigen planning en ontwikkeling.


Onze mensen vertellen graag hoe het is om bij Joanknecht te werken. Lees hier het verhaal van onze collega Jeroen Vervoort, teamlid IT-Services, over de ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden bij Joanknecht. Of maak kennis met Lana Ebergen, junior IT-auditor.

**Talent**


Wij zoeken iemand die…

* enthousiast en leergierig is;
* geïnteresseerd is in de financiele wereld en de wereld van IT;
* begrijpt hoe IT werkt, maar niet persé een techneut is;
* beschikt over een afgeronde opleiding op het gebied van information management, informatica, business & ICT, business IT & management, ICT-beheer of IT-systems. Kan zowel op mbo, hbo als universitair niveau;
* gemotiveerd is om ons IT-services team mee uit te bouwen!

En kun jij met goede ideeën het werk nog slimmer aanpakken? Kom dan het Productiehuis versterken als ICT-analist. Vanuit een leuk en inspirerend team draag je bij aan de veiligheid op straat. Je gaat aan de slag met de uitwerking van vernieuwings- en verbeteringsvraagstukken van de informatievoorziening binnen de politie. Dankzij goede informatievoorziening kunnen politiemedewerkers hun werk nog beter doen.


**Specificaties vacature**
--------------------------


### **Locatie(s):**


Utrecht
### **Organisatieonderdeel:**


Politiedienstencentrum
### **Vakgebied(en):**


ICT
### **Niveau:**


HBO BACHELOR
**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Als ICT-analist ben je medeverantwoordelijk voor het adequaat laten werken van de informatievoorzieningsketen; van beleidsthema's tot applicaties en systemen. Je denkt mee over de toekomst van apps en systemen en vertaalt (maatschappelijke) ontwikkelingen naar je werkterrein. Dat is jouw corebusiness als ICT-analist.


Je zorgt voor een werkbare vertaling van de wensen van verschillende collega’s, zoals politieagenten/materiedeskundigen, UX-designers, product owners en ontwikkelaars. Jouw missie is geslaagd als de politieagent op straat nog makkelijker in staat is om zijn of haar werk te doen.


Een greep uit jouw werkzaamheden:


* je adviseert bij de intake, vormgeving en uitvoering van IV-trajecten die betrekking hebben op de portefeuille waarvoor je werkzaam bent;
* je zorgt voor een goede vraagarticulatie op IV-verbeterings- en vernieuwingsvraagstukken en verricht de benodigde analyses en vooronderzoeken;
* je draagt bij aan de uitwerking van epics en features.


Daarnaast houd je je bezig met het definiëren en uitwerken van (non)functionele gebruikersspecificaties en het borgen van de inrichting van de informatieprocessen. Je focus ligt op een onderdeel van de totale vraagstelling. Vanuit jouw kennis op dit onderdeel draag je proactief kennis over aan je collega's die hiervoor werkzaam zijn. Daarbij zorg je voor een effectieve werkuitvoering overeenkomstig de vastgestelde planning. Bij dit alles houd je rekening met de ontwikkelingen binnen het IV-landschap. Dit doe je door onder andere deel te nemen aan in- en externe netwerken van specialisten.


**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


Je werkt in het Productiehuis van de Dienst IV. Hier ontwikkelen multidisciplinaire DevOps-teams snel en flexibel nieuwe functionaliteiten voor de operationele politiediensten. Je werkt hybride, maar 1 á 2 keer per week werken we vanuit ons prachtige nieuwe kantoorpand in Utrecht. We omarmen het Agile gedachtengoed. Je ontmoet collega’s in het veld of bezoekt ketenpartners, zodat je nog meer inzicht krijgt in hoe de informatievoorziening van de politie in het grote geheel werkt. En natuurlijk zodat je met eigen ogen kunt zien waar je het allemaal voor doet.


Jij gaat aan de slag bij het Programma Vernieuwend Registreren (PVR). PVR vervangt, verbetert en vernieuwt de registratieve operationele politiesystemen. Dit zijn systemen die onder andere agenten gebruiken bij handhaving en opsporing. PVR is korpsprioriteit en is op dit moment één van de grootste ICT-overheidsprogramma’s. Jij bent werkzaam binnen één van de subteams van het Product Manager Support Team (PMST). Het PMST bestaat uit ongeveer vijfenveertig personen en is opgedeeld in verschillende subteams. Deze hebben de taak om IV-epics uit te werken en te detailleren (‘refinement’) tot het niveau dat een feature-team dit kan bouwen. Wij werken volgens het Scaling Agile Model Politie ter ondersteuning van het snel en wendbaar realiseren van de gewenste informatievoorziening.


**Wie ben jij?**
----------------


Jij bent een ICT-analist die ziet wat er gedaan moet worden. De uiteenlopende IV-vraagstukken kun je goed op waarde schatten, analyseren en verwoorden. Je bent innovatief en resultaatgericht en draagt eraan bij dat de IV-keten zo optimaal mogelijk functioneert. Doordat je een groot netwerk hebt of dit ontwikkelt is het voor jou niet moeilijk informatie, steun en medewerking te krijgen van collega's en relaties. Verder kun je op verschillende niveaus (operationeel en tactisch) met stakeholders communiceren. Je bent je bewust van de organisatie waarin je werkt en houdt rekening met de verschillende belangen. Ook beschik je over overtuigingskracht en kun je verbanden leggen en je advies hierop afstemmen. Je kunt goed luisteren, feedback ontvangen en uitdelen.


Verder heb je:


* hbo (bachelor) werk- en denkniveau en bij voorkeur een opleiding in de richting van Bedrijfskunde, Bestuurskunde of Informatiemanagement;
* relevante ervaring met IV-vernieuwingsvraagstukken;
* relevante ervaring in het zelfstandig uitvoeren van IV-onderzoeken en -impactanalyses, in samenwerking met een multidisciplinair IV-team en vertegenwoordigers vanuit de business;
* actuele kennis van en ervaring met Informatievoorziening en Scaled Agile methoden zoals SAFe en LeSS;
* actuele kennis van informatiearchitectuur en informatiebeveiliging;
* relevante ervaring in vakinhoudelijk coachen van collega's.


**Wat wij bieden**
------------------


De standplaats is Utrecht. Er is ruimte voor 2 fte. Het betreft een functie voor 36 uur per week.


Omdat goede mensen belangrijk zijn binnen de politie investeren we in jouw toekomst. We bieden uitgebreide ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden en een aanstelling in tijdelijke dienst voor een proeftijd van een jaar. Bij voldoende functioneren wordt de aanstelling na een jaar omgezet in een vaste aanstelling.


Verder kun je het volgende van ons verwachten:


* een bruto maandsalaris van minimaal €4.209,- en maximaal €6.176,- (schaal 11 Bbp) op basis van een 36-urige werkweek;

**Zo ziet jouw baan eruit**
---------------------------

  

Ben jij een aanpakker? En lijkt het jou geweldig om richting te geven aan complexe (IT)-vraagstukken binnen de Hub Klant Interface? Herken jij jezelf in onderstaand profiel? Dan ben jij de PEGA Developer die wij zoeken en zien we jouw sollicitatie graag tegemoet. Bouw mee aan een maatschappelijk betrokken bank waaraan klanten met een gerust hart hun geld toevertrouwen!


Als developer draag je bij aan de doorvertaling van requirements naar een technisch design. Ook ben je verantwoordelijk voor de bouw en succesvolle implementatie van nieuwe features in de applicatie. Voorbeelden van werkzaamheden waar je aan mee zult werken zijn het aansluiten van nieuwe merken of audiences, integreren van nieuwe (contact)kanalen of het aansluiten van data-attributen. Je configureert en onderhoudt de applicatie. Je begrijpt goed wat er gebeurt achter de schermen, waardoor ontwerpbeslissingen vooraf worden genomen en je een goede basis hebt voor het oplossen van complexe problemen.


Hier kom je te werken  

Je gaat aan de slag in het Personalisatieteam binnen de hub Klant Interface. Hier werk je met zo’n twintig collega’s in een multidisciplinair team. Samen maken we gepersonaliseerde interacties mogelijk in alle kanalen van onze merken SNS, ASN Bank, RegioBank en BLG Wonen.  

  

We zijn onderverdeeld in twee subteams: een Build-team voor doorontwikkeling van de applicatie en een Enable-team dat het personalisatie-gedachtegoed verspreid binnen de organisatie en de personalisaties faciliteert. Jij valt onder het Build-team. Dit gedreven en gezellige team van internationale professionals bestaat uit een architect, tester, business analist, lead system architect, lead decisioning architect en pega developers: jij dus ?.  

  

Jullie focussen je op de doorontwikkeling van Pega CDH en dagen elkaar met inhoudelijke discussies uit om de klantinteracties steeds verder te verbeteren en de technische mogelijkheden en vernieuwingen zo goed mogelijk te benutten. De lijnen zijn kort; we weten elkaar zowel on- als offline snel te vinden en helpen elkaar waar nodig. Omdat een deel van het team in het buitenland werkt, spreken we vooral Engels met elkaar.  

  

Werken doen we zowel thuis als op kantoor, maar elke donderdag zien we elkaar in ieder geval op onze standplaats in Utrecht en maken we naast worktalk tijd voor small talk.  

  

Hub Klant Interface  

Deze hub is cruciaal voor de Volksbank en is verantwoordelijk voor alle processen en digitale kanalen die met de klant interface te maken hebben. Daarom is deze hub ook een ‘enabling hub’ voor alle merken en diensten. De hub bestaat uit zo’n 200 collega’s met product owners, business analisten, developers en architecten.  

  

Jouw kwaliteiten

* Je hebt een afgeronde HBO/WO opleiding, die bij voorkeur IT-gerelateerd is. En minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring binnen IT.
* Je bent communicatief vaardig in Nederlands en Engels.
* Je zorgt voor een prettige samenwerking door je goed in te leven in de (toekomstige) wensen en uitdagingen van opdrachtgevers en klantbehoeften. Deze weet je door te vertalen in passende oplossingen.
* Je signaleert zelf ook proactief verbeterkansen en onderneemt hierop actie.
* Je kunt complexe problemen analyseren en houdt wel van een technische uitdaging.
* Feedback geven en ontvangen zie je als een kans voor verbetering.
* Je hebt basiskennis van programmeren, bijvoorbeeld logica, datastructuren en concepten zoals lussen en voorwaardelijke instructies.
* Je beschikt over een goed begrip van databases en querytalen, zoals SQL.
* Je hebt kennis van API's en integratiepatronen om externe systemen met de low-code applicaties te kunnen verbinden.
* Je bent je bewust van beveiligingsprincipes en best practices.
* Met je flexibele opstelling weet je je aan te passen aan veranderende omstandigheden. Je hebt affiniteit met scrum agile werken en een T-shape instelling, waarbij je jezelf graag ontwikkelt.
* Jij mist geen deadlines, want je houdt de voortgang van diverse projecten waar je tegelijk aan werkt goed in de gaten en stemt prioriteiten af met je team en stakeholders.


Verder is een pré

* Ervaring met Pega (CSA/CSSA-certificatie) of een ander low code platform
* Kennis van Java

Ervaring met DevOps  
* 

Wat krijg je van ons?  

De salarisschaal voor deze functie ligt tussen de € 3.173,46- en € 4.882,26 op basis van 36 uur per week.Daarnaast kun je rekenen op:

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

You Are…
* Able to develop and deepen strong relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders and have a proven track record of influencing strategic decisions through data.
* Able to thrive with minimal oversight and process, connecting the dots across business needs and independently driving projects forward.
* Proven experience with ML models and an understanding of modern ML algorithms, enabling effective collaboration with ML researchers and engineers.

Netflix is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with 278 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

 **The Role**


Our mission at Netflix is to connect global stories with global audiences. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.


Recently, Netflix has expanded its entertainment offering to include Live content, like The Roast of Tom Brady Comedy Special, the SAG Awards ceremony, and The Netflix Slam tennis match. Our scope will grow to include premium live entertainment with our growing Live content catalogue, including WWE, NFL, and more.


Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips. This is made possible because Netflix UI is a thriving learning machine where Artwork & Video assets are personalized via reinforcement learning.


Europe is a significant center for our broader Studio and Creative Production teams. We’re looking for a Senior Analytics Engineer based in our Amsterdam office to join our growing European team. In this role, you would serve as a trusted partner for regional Creative Production leadership. Given this data & insights rich landscape, we are looking for a highly motivated Senior Analytics Engineer to partner with business teams and product managers to empower how we create Artwork and Trailers. This is an opportunity for you to have direct influence on strategic decisions through technical and business thought partnership that will ultimately shape promotional content.

**As a Senior Analytics Engineer in this space, you will…**

* Be a strategic partner for Studio & Creative Production teams: identify critical analytical problems and apply an entrepreneurial mindset to find innovative solutions with data
* Being the lead analytics engineer partnering with our Product Creative Studio partners who are responsible for the promotional assets for Live content experiences.
* Drive the direction of your work, developing solutions that span from scrappy code and prototype tools to high-visibility dashboards and analyses for Studio & Creative Production leadership
* Spearhead the creation of new metrics that impact decision-making
* Collaborate with Data Scientists & Data Engineers to source data from new systems and strengthen our foundational data models
* Become a regional expert on all things Studio Data Science & Engineering, helping educate and connect regional offices to existing data solutions

**You are…**

* A strong communicator who can develop and deepen strong relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders. You have experience partnering closely with executive leadership, with a proven track record of influencing strategic decisions through data.
* Comfortable with ambiguity; able to thrive with minimal oversight and process. You connect the dots across business needs and independently drive projects forward.
* A senior analytics professional with extensive experience across data wrangling, analysis, reporting, and visualization.
* An expert in a data-oriented programming language (e.g. SQL, Python, R, Scala, etc.) and intuitive dashboard/visualization design (e.g. Tableau)
* Proficient in ETL and data warehousing best practices and core statistics concepts (e.g. hypothesis testing)
* Adept at working across different cultures on a globally-distributed team, with core working hours in the Central European and GMT time zones

**Culture**


You will have the opportunity to impact the business in a meaningful way, working alongside smart people who love to solve hard problems, and who not only expect but also foster high performance. You will have the freedom to innovate, solve interesting problems and influence decision-making in a fast paced, exciting environment.

Why Interfood?
  
Interfood is a fantastic company for both personal and professional growth. When I started fresh out of college, I never imagined I would become a community manager traveling to Singapore, Uruguay, and Miami, or speaking about my experiences at events.

I expect a new colleague to identify their areas of interest and become a sparring partner in those areas—whether it's one or all of them.

This is an opportunity to work at a company that is changing the way information supports business decisions. At Splunk, we've grown rapidly across Europe by helping leading companies (including 90 of the Fortune 100) go from data to business outcomes faster than ever.
  

Join us on our journey as Splunk Solution Engineer, and enjoy a culture of inclusiveness, disruption, and fun while selling smart and winning big.
What’s the role of a Solution Engineer at Splunk?* You will technically own, discover, position, prove and deliver the key technical elements of a sales cycle to achieve a ‘technical win’ within large scale and complex customer environments. You’ll use a range of communication styles, a range of technology skills and experiences and a range of soft skills and people skills to develop trust relationships with both your sales colleagues and your customers.
* You will be an advocate and ambassador for Splunk through your professional social media, industry and marketing events and supporting pipeline generation activities
* You will collaborate with your customer contacts, and build them into Splunk champions, by helping them to understand how Splunk can help them to solve some of their most challenging problems and help them achieve their objectives.


Responsibilities:* Ability to demonstrate Splunk products and services to customers on site, remotely via webinar sessions, and at field events such as conferences and trade shows.
* Establish and maintain strong relationships throughout the sales cycle with all levels within the customer.

* Answer complex technical and competitive questions plus address customer concerns to a successful outcome.
* You should have experience with discovering pain and determining value with customers.

* Technically Astute: You enjoy the detail, even if you don’t always need to express it. You have a thirst for up-to-date knowledge of the technologies and solutions that businesses use to be successful as they transform.
* Confidence: But not arrogant – you have the confidence that comes from the knowledge that your product is rock solid, and the ability to transmit this confidence to a customer. That means you might sit down with a customer already using your product to show them how they might use it even better!
* Business Savvy: You understand how businesses are organized, how they achieve their desired results, what challenges they are likely to face, what solutions they need and what transformations they could make with your solutions.
* A growth mindset: You build in time to develop your skills, knowledge, experience or capabilities. You look beyond the current opportunity towards the wider set of opportunities that could exist in a prospect.
* A Collaborator: You understand that selling is a team game, so you spend time developing your network of colleagues and partners to achieve your success – and theirs.
* Competitive: If you’re in it, you want to win it!
* Fun: Getting the job done and enjoying & generating fun don’t need to be mutually exclusive.
* The candidate must be based in the Netherlands and be fluent in Dutch and English.

We are Xomnia, the AI consulting company. We’re curious problem solvers who believe data will change the way we live, work and communicate. Being at the forefront of this revolutionary change in a sustainable, positive way is what drives us.



We solve challenging data science and engineering projects, from start to finish. From developing an application for real-time fraud detection on Google Cloud Platform, to setting up a customized recommender engine in an existing Microsoft Azure environment - we develop and deploy tailor-made data science solutions.

  


Xomnia started in 2013 in one room in the heart of Amsterdam. These days we take up nearly two houses. But more than just a workspace, we're a community that values authenticity. Here, everyone is encouraged to be themselves, to learn, and to have fun in the process.



Representing over 20 nationalities, our team values the unique cultural perspective that each individual brings to the table. Moreover, with the Dutch tech sector seeing a female representation around 11%, we are proud that over 30% of our workforce is female. Nevertheless, we recognize that there is more to be done, and we continue working to overcome barriers that still exist.

  


We encourage all candidates to apply, and we don’t discriminate based on race, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age. However, a reality that we face is that many of our clients prefer to communicate in Dutch, making Dutch proficiency essential for some roles. Additionally, while we wish that we could sponsor visas for everyone, there are instances when it is not feasible.

 **The Role**


Our mission at Netflix is to connect global stories with global audiences. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.


Recently, Netflix has expanded its entertainment offering to include Live content, like The Roast of Tom Brady Comedy Special, the SAG Awards ceremony, and The Netflix Slam tennis match. Our scope will grow to include premium live entertainment with our growing Live content catalogue, including WWE, NFL, and more.


Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips. This is made possible because Netflix UI is a thriving learning machine where Artwork & Video assets are personalized via reinforcement learning.

This is an opportunity for you to have direct influence on strategic decisions through technical and business thought partnership that will ultimately shape promotional content.

**As a Senior Analytics Engineer in this space, you will…**

* Be a strategic partner for Studio & Creative Production teams: identify critical analytical problems and apply an entrepreneurial mindset to find innovative solutions with data
* Being the lead analytics engineer partnering with our Product Creative Studio partners who are responsible for the promotional assets for Live content experiences.
* Drive the direction of your work, developing solutions that span from scrappy code and prototype tools to high-visibility dashboards and analyses for Studio & Creative Production leadership

En voel jij je verantwoordelijk voor de algehele kwaliteit en samenhang van het IT-landschap?**

**Dan zoeken we jou!**

**Introductie van de rol**

Als Technical Architect ben je eindverantwoordelijk voor de technische architectuur op de korte en lange termijn in projecten en sales trajecten. Je beschrijft en ontwikkelt de technische architectuur inclusief de integraties die daarbij komen kijken. Naast het ontwerpen van migratiescenario’s, onderhoud je ook contact met de technische en inhoudelijke stakeholders bij de klant en HSO.

  

Als Technical Architect ben je de motivator voor de technische collega’s van het klantteam. Als digital leader naar de klant ben je in staat om breder te kijken dan de oplossing die wij leveren maar zie je deze in het totale end-to-end klantproces.

**Wat vertellen onze huidige technische architecten over deze rol?**


“Het werk als technische architect is heel erg uitdagend en gevarieerd. Je werkt samen met hele leuke collega’s op projecten. Op het project ben je verantwoordelijk voor de algehele kwaliteit en samenhang van het IT-landschap. Primair binnen de kaders van het project. Echter doordat je implementatie altijd samenhangt met andere systemen ben je ook veel bezig met het landschap buiten het Microsoft-project. Je bepaalt samen met de klant waar je naartoe gaat over de jaren heen en ziet jouw plannen dan werkelijkheid worden. Als je het leuk vindt is er ook altijd ruimte om op de inhoud in te gaan. Als je dat doet ben je vooral bezig met de complexe onderdelen van het project en dat is erg leuk en uitdagend.


Naast de projecten houd je je bezig met de best practices van HSO. Je krijgt daardoor altijd de nieuwe ontwikkelingen mee en krijgt de kans om daar wat mee te doen.”

* Draag je bij aan de technische best practices van HSO en draagt deze ook uit naar de klant en het team;

* Zorg je voor de succesvolle uitvoering van technische oplossingen en bewaak je de naleving van projectplanningen en budgetten;
* Blijf je op de hoogte van de nieuwste ontwikkelingen op het Dynamics 365-platform, inclusief Dataverse, Power Platform en andere gerelateerde technologieën.

**Over het team**


Je bent onderdeel van de Service Line Unified Operations, een onderdeel van HSO Nederland. Unified Operations is een geoliede projectservices organisatie met een uitstekende reputatie op het gebied van ERP. Samen met de andere Servicelines binnen HSO kunnen we de complete Microsoft Stack aanbieden (Modern Workplace, AI, Data & Analytics, CE, Power Platform, Azure Integrations, e.d.). Het totale team van onze Service Line bestaat momenteel uit ruim 100 professionals, onder leiding van de Service Line Director Arie Martin van den Akker.

+ Minimaal 7 jaar ervaring met Dynamics 365 F&O implementaties in een technische rol;
+ Je hebt uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden die je inzet bij het aansturen van de Software engineers;
+ Je bent in staat om op basis van de behoeften van de klant een technisch ontwerp te maken en de structuur van de oplossing uit te denken;

+ Uitstekende beheersing van de Nederlandse en Engelse taal in woord en geschrift.

**Stageopdracht | Hbo - Wo | SPECTO Aerospace | Amsterdam Lelystad Airport**

  

**""Het bouwen van een geavanceerd systeem waarin middels** Dynamic Augmented Reality technische informatie vanuit de echte wereld wordt toegevoegd aan een virtueel 3D vliegtuigonderdeel. **Die stap zetten we graag samen met jou!""**

  

Bij SPECTO Aerospace, een gecertificeerd luchtvaart-technisch bedrijf gevestigd op Lelystad-Airport en op de luchtmachtbasis in Woensdrecht, repareren we hoogwaardige composiet onderdelen voor de internationale luchtvaart- en defensie-industrie. Met een team van ongeveer 50 collega's werken we hard aan onze toekomst. Alles draait bij ons om vindingrijkheid, innovatie en kwaliteit en daarom zetten wij als onderhoudsbedrijf technologie-stappen die verder gaan dan de vereisten binnen de luchtvaartbranche. We zijn trots op ons vak en hebben allemaal hart voor de zaak. Samen gaan we voor het beste resultaat en helpen we elkaar waar nodig. Bij ons heerst een open en familiaire sfeer, waarbij onze kernwaardes gericht zijn op mensen.

  

**De Casus**



SPECTO is in feite een ambachtsbedrijf in een high-tech omgeving (www.spectoaerospace.com). Wij hebben ons ten doel gesteld om verregaand te digitaliseren. Niet omdat dat efficiënter is maar ook omdat ons dat gaat helpen om ‘het spel te veranderen’. In het reparatieproces van composiet vliegtuigonderdelen wordt standaard al een veelheid aan detailgegevens vastgelegd door specialisten en engineers en wij willen deze informatie in een 3D-omgeving gaan verwerken om hiermee in beelden te kunnen communiceren naar stakeholders (Visualization), om informatie tijdens het proces te ontsluiten en op te slaan (Digital Twinning) en om al deze data te kunnen analyseren om de volgende generatie vliegtuigonderdelen te kunnen ontwerpen (Data Analytics). Hiervoor willen wij onze schaal 1:1 3D-modellen gaan gebruiken die wij zelf met onze eigen geavanceerde scannerapparatuur maken van vliegtuigonderdelen

 **De Opdracht**

  

Wij hebben een Proof of Concept applicatie ontwikkeld waarin wij in staat zijn om vormen te tekenen op een 3D model en deze te linken aan onderliggende data. Deze applicatie is echter nog niet af: wij willen 3D kleur- en meetdata op een laagdrempelige manier kunnen opnemen vanuit de realiteit (fysieke omgeving) en deze vastleggen/overzetten als informatielaag op het 3D model in de virtuele omgeving. Voor deze opdracht is het een vereiste dat je sterke affiniteit dan wel ervaring hebt met werken met 3D technieken. Denk hierbij aan bijvoorbeeld fotogrammetrie technieken, Augmented Reality of UV-mapping.

 **Wat mag j****e verwachten van SPECTO**


* Een leeromgeving waarin we met je samenwerken en je echt onderdeel bent van het SPECTO Team!
* Flexibiliteit in werktijden en locaties
* Een marktconforme stagevergoeding
### **Vereisten**

**Wat verwachten we van jou als Stagiair?**

  


Jij bent een enthousiaste teamspeler die het leuk vindt om samen met ons op Lelystad Airport nieuwe oplossingen te bedenken, te onderzoeken, te bouwen én te testen. Je bent een creatieve denker en je hebt een passie voor nieuwe technologie en tools.

  

Verder vragen wij:

-------------------


  
Ben jij die Data Scientist die het leuk vindt om modellen en algoritmes te onderzoeken en ontwikkelen? Of houd je je liever bezig met het innoveren, valideren en toepassen hiervan? Of ben je bedreven in het in productie brengen van deze modellen?



Wat ga je doen?  

Voor de nationale veiligheid is het cruciaal dat inlichtingenteams van de Algemene Inlichtingen en Veiligheidsdienst (AIVD) en Militaire Inlichtingen en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD) snel relevante informatie kunnen vinden in uiteenlopende datastromen. Het verwerken van de informatie die wordt verworven gebeurt uiteraard binnen de kaders van de Wet op de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdiensten (Wiv2017).  

Het Data Science team heeft de ambitie om Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning (AI/ML) -oplossingen te ontwikkelen, valideren en productionaliseren. Zo stellen wij de inlichtingenteams en operationele afdelingen van de diensten in staat om deze datastromen te analyseren. Het team Data Science werkt samen in drie clusters van respectievelijk Research Data Scientists, Applied Data Scientists en AI/ML Engineers. Als Research Data Scientist doe je onderzoek naar en ontwikkel je (productiematig in te zetten) modellen, als Applied Data Scientist werk je mee aan de innovatie met en validatie van state-of-the-art Data Science-algoritmes en modellen voor nieuwe toepassingen en als AI/ML Engineer ligt jouw focus primair op de operationalisering en optimalisering van deze algoritmes en modellen binnen het on-premise ecosysteem voor beide diensten (MLOps).

* Als Applied Data Scientist valideer en verbeter je nieuwe en bestaande AI/ML-technieken om kort-cyclisch dienstbrede vraagstukken het hoofd te bieden, en toon je de bruikbaarheid en inzetbaarheid van proofs-of-concept;
* Als AI/ML Engineer optimaliseer je algoritmes en modellen voor de productie en het onderhoud hiervan en ontwikkel je een complex high performance framework dat in de organisatie wordt ingezet bij het (realtime) verrijken van data in processing, applicaties en andere toepassingen;
* In deze functie werk je samen met de operationele en inlichtingenteams van de AIVD en MIVD, nationale en internationale partners uit de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsketen en met verscheidene (technische) experts;

**De functie**
--------------


In de functie van data scientist werk je voor de directie Financiën en Inkoop. Het leuke daarvan: dit gaat niet alleen om euro’s, maar ook om wat we daarmee precies doen. En dat is veel! Dankzij de producten uit jouw team hebben managers en hun adviseurs beter zicht op budget en uitgaven. De directie heeft beter zicht op de efficiency van werkprocessen. En het gemeentelijk directieteam kan beter sturen op geld en waarde.



Wat jouw rol precies inhoudt? Als data scientist ontwikkel en implementeer je data- en (generatieve) AI-oplossingen. Dat doe je samen met de collega’s binnen een datateam van data scientists, cloud engineers en BI specialisten, maar ook met collega’s die deze oplossingen gaan gebruiken. Je krijgt er dus direct een groot Amsterdams netwerk bij en werkt praktisch en creatief samen. Je bent daarnaast onderzoekend en vindt het leuk om te experimenteren met nieuwe technieken. Je reflecteert op je werk en je stimuleert collega’s om er samen alles uit te halen wat erin zit.


Dit doe je op een gemiddelde dag
--------------------------------

* Je werkt volgens een Agile Scrum methode en start daarom je dag met een standup. Je bespreekt met je collega’s in het scrum-team welke stories je gaat oppakken.
* Na een kop koffie ga je aan de slag, individueel dan wel samen, met het incrementeel produceren van een data- en AI-oplossing.
* Voordat je aan de lunch commit, test je jouw code en review je een pull-request van je collega.
* 's Middags staan er wat calls op het programma met je directe collega-ontwikkelaars of andere stakeholders om te zorgen dat iedereen op één lijn zit.
* Je houdt je ogen open voor de nieuwste trends die onze digitale overheid kunnen versterken en denkt na over hoe je die kunt toepassen binnen het financiële domein.
* Je eindigt je dag met het bijwerken van de Jira-omgeving en een gezamenlijk sportmoment als je op locatie werkt.


Hier ga je aan de slag
----------------------

We willen een goede werkgever zijn die ervoor zorgt dat alle collega’s zich gezien en gewaardeerd voelen. We koesteren verschillen tussen collega’s, al die verschillen zorgen voor betere resultaten voor onze organisatie én onze stad. We streven daarbij naar een personeelsbestand dat een afspiegeling is van de beroepsbevolking van Amsterdam. Dus wie jij ook bent: bij ons ben je van harte welkom!


Sluit je aan bij ons team Data, Rapportages & Innovatie, waar talentvolle nieuwkomers samen met ervaren experts Amsterdam vooruithelpen. We zijn een sociaal en divers team dat buiten werktijd graag samenkomt voor een drankje of een sportieve uitdaging. Maar laad jij liever op door op tijd naar huis te gaan? Ook helemaal prima. Bij ons draait het om samenwerken, plezier en de ruimte nemen om onze successen en het werk dat we doen te waarderen. Lijkt het jou wat om samen met ons inventieve oplossingen te bedenken die de gemeente helpen om verstandige financiële keuzes te maken? Dan is dit jouw plek.


Dit breng je mee
----------------

Met slimme technologie analyseren we razendsnel en zorgvuldig de financiële data van een bedrijf om te bepalen wat het maximale bedrag is dat een ondernemer verantwoord kan lenen. Aan de andere kant hebben we investeerders die dit allemaal mogelijk maken! En samen brengen we Nederland vooruit.

If so, consider applying for the Junior Data Scientist position at IG&H!**

  

As a Data Scientist, you will play a crucial role in helping our clients derive valuable and new insights from large and complex datasets. You start doing this by creating deep understanding of the challenges our clients are facing. Together with your team, you’ll then determine how to create most business value for our clients.

Methods we use range from more basic data processing techniques to machine learning and large language models. Finally, you communicate and present results convincingly, to create real and lasting impact. We believe that those who can combine analytical skills with business sense are most successful in creating this impact for our clients.

  

IG&H is active in three sectors (retail, financial services and health), allowing you to get experience on a variety of projects. On top, you'll be working closely with IG&H consultants outside of the Data & Analytics team too, such that you learn much more than only data related skills. Especially if you start your career at IG&H, this will help you in understanding what you really like doing and want to learn.  



  

Next to excellent employment conditions, working at IG&H will be a great place to kick-start your career.

Also, you will be assigned a mentor, who will be there for you to provide you with guidance.  



  

Above all, people are at the heart of what we do. This of course comes back in the work we deliver for our clients (why make a data product if the people who need to use it don’t understand or want to use it?). At the same time, a fun working culture is key for who we are. With an inspiring office in Utrecht where we can connect, have abundant parties, team activities and sport events (both organised for the entire IG&H organization as well as specifically for the Data & Analytics team), IG&H is truly a Great Place To Work. And yes, we are certified!  



  

  

*“In addition to on-the-job learning, you learn everything you need to know about consultancy in the IG&H Academy. The program consists of various internal and external training courses and has been specifically developed for trainees. Besides training sessions, the Academy often organizes trips and dinners. Through these, you quickly develop good relationships with co-workers at IG&H. I see many of them outside of work on a regular basis”* **Jasmijn Haverhals (Consultant Healthcare)**

  

*“The most beautiful thing about consulting is the diversity within the projects. IG&H offers next to different clients, a variety in the types of assignments. One assignment could be very strategic, in which you outline the direction of a company. Whereas another assignment could be focused on implementation, in which you are working together with the client to deliver concrete results.”* **Peter Hardy (Director)**

 **What we ask:**

  

* MSc degree in Econometrics, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence or similar field
* You have excellent Dutch and English communication skills, due to client needs
* Analytical, inventive and practical
* Python and/or R skills


**What we offer you:**

  

* Working at a Great Place To Work with a pleasant atmosphere, enthusiastic colleagues who support you and many fun activities
* Continuous development through the IG&H Academy and active on the job coaching
* Permanent (indefinite) contract right away
* Excellent salary and working benefits
* Company car / good mobility scheme
* 25 holiday days with the possibility to take up to 5 more
* Generous bonus scheme
* Possibility to take a sabbatical after 3 years of employment
* IG&H facilitates a Healthy Human programme, where you get guidance with all adjustments in life, such as having a child or being a caregiver to a sick family member
* Possibility to work parttime (32 hours), at least 4 days a week
* Great opportunity to make an active contribution to the further growth of the organization
* And more, which we would love to elaborate on

Then this opportunity might be for you!


**Your job**
------------


Mountains are the water towers of the world. They receive a disproportionately large amount of precipitation due to orographic lifting. The most important water towers are Asia’s mountain ranges, particularly the Himalaya, the Karakoram and the Pamir. These mountains contain the largest ice reserves beyond the polar regions and are therefore often collectively referred to as the Third Pole.


Here, mountain precipitation feeds glaciers and snowpacks, generating river flow that supplies major reservoirs and sustains millions of people downstream. At the same time, extreme mountain precipitation triggers floods, landslides, debris flows, and avalanches. Without understanding the drivers and magnitude of mountain precipitation, quantifying the mountain water cycle is virtually impossible. You will work as a team member in the ERC Advanced project DROP, which focuses on understanding how mountains, land-surface feedbacks, and large-scale atmospheric circulation control the distribution of mountain precipitation in time and space on the Third Pole.


In this PhD project, you will focus on understanding the interaction between mountain ranges and precipitation using observations and large-scale remote sensing at the synoptic scale. You will combine observations, remote sensing, and outputs from an atmospheric model to investigate and explain seasonal differences in the large-scale orography-precipitation interplay. You will work closely with another PhD candidate and a postdoc in the same project.


To support academic and personal development, PhD candidates follow courses and assist in teaching Earth Sciences at the Bachelor's and Master's levels. Together, these activities amount to twenty percent of the contracted time.


**Your qualities**
------------------


This project may be the right fit for you if you have:


* an MSc in meteorology, hydrology, civil engineering, geosciences, environmental science, or a related field;
* a passion for mountains and the ability and willingness to conduct fieldwork in challenging conditions;
* strong quantitative methodological skills, particularly in (spatial) data analysis, remote sensing, and atmospheric and/or hydrological modelling;
* experience with programming languages (Python/R), preferably using spatial datasets;
* basic theoretical understanding of mountain meteorology;
* an interest in interdisciplinary collaborations and motivation to work in a close team;
* excellent English oral and scientific writing skills, with a willingness to learn Dutch.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for 1 year, with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period;
* a working week of 38 hours and a gross monthly salary between €2.770 and €3.539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth.

Je staat voor het waarborgen van de betrouwbaarheid, beschikbaarheid en actualiteit van de data en haalt energie uit werken in een dynamische IT-omgeving. Als systematisch denker met een domein overstijgende visie, weet je het overzicht te bewaren in de complexiteit van taken en projecten. Je kunt jouw omgeving effectief meenemen in veranderingen en handelt in het belang van het centrum als geheel. Ook ben je goed op de hoogte van de nieuwste ontwikkelingen op het gebied van moderne dataplatforms en haal je voldoening uit agile werken. Je vindt het belangrijk om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen in kennis en vaardigheden met betrekking tot de gebruikte tools en technologieën. Je werkt nauwkeurig, hebt een groot zelfsturend vermogen en baseert je beslissingen op beproefde data-engineeringprincipes. Daarnaast voel je je verantwoordelijk voor zowel je eigen resultaten als die van het team. Samen streef je naar het beste resultaat, waarbij de kwaliteit en integriteit van data altijd voorop staan.

The Growing Up Together in Society (GUTS) consortium, funded by a Gravitation grant from the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, includes the collaboration of seven Dutch universities that together investigate how young people successfully navigate and grow up in our complex society.
We will study individual neurobiological development in relation to educational processes, social networks, and societal norms, including antisocial behavior. We will use state-of-the-art designs and methodological advances to develop an integrative framework on self-regulation development and contributions to society that will have explanatory as well as predictive power across multiple domains of functioning in adolescence and early adulthood.  


**Work description**
Your Role
As a PhD or postdoc reseracher you are part of a sub-team of the GUTS project that operates in Amsterdam, which has the unique aim to include 400 young participants (ages 10-12-years) that are at high risk of developing severe behavioral problems.
During your research trajectory, you will mainly focus on understanding the role of affective empathy in developing successful social interactions, in a cohort of children (10-12 years) that are at high risk of developing antisocial and delinquent behavior. Affective empathy will be mainly measured through fMRI as activity in response to the emotional state of other individuals. Social behaviour will be measure through social behavioural tasks and inteviews. During your time in the lab you will have the opportunity to:
* study the role of affective empathy combining forensic-, behavioral- and neuroscience;
* setting up and recruit the high risk antisocial cohort of 400 children in the age range between 10-12, together with the PIs, a postdoc and two other PhDs
* collect and analyze fMRI (the empathy task in particular), behavioural (e.g. a social variation of the flanker task) and interviews (e.g. from questionnaires, and structure interviews) data
* access and analyse previously acquired large cohorts data to develop brain signature to be used to predict anti-social behavior in the newly acquired cohort
* publish your findings in open access scientific journals.
* actively participate in the communication with young people about their perspective on the study an relevant assessments, as well as the clinical and societal impact of your research findings.

Environment  

The Social Brain Lab (SBL) at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience (NIN)
This will be your main home, in which one of your direct supervisor will be working on a daily base and where you will be appointed.
The *Social Brain Lab* is the results of the joint venture of the research groups of Christian Keysers and Valeria Gazzola, aiming at shedding light on the neural mechanisms of empathy by combining studies in humans and rodents. The SBL is funded by multiple European (ERC, Marie Curie) and Dutch (VIDI, VICI, Gravity, XL) grants, and is characterized by an unusually diverse environment, with members from all over the world, backgrounds (ranging from philosophy to engineering with an emphasis on biology and psychology), and neuroscientific techniques (spanning from ultra-high field fMRI in humans to single-cell recordings in rodents). The SBL is appreciated for its collaborative, enthusiastic and supportive environment, where people strive to become successful, recognized and appreciated scientists.
Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry & Psychosocial Care, at the Amsterdam UMC, within the Section Youth at Risk.
This will be your second home, where your co-supervisor, L. Nauta-Jansen will be located. You’ll likely have periodic meetings with colleagues at this location.
Within the section Youth at Risk, we focus on children and adolescents at risk of displaying antisocial and delinquent behavior. We mainly operate within the field of Forensic Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Our main aim is to study why some children and adolescents display antisocial or delinquent behavior, why most desist and some persist in that behavior, and what (preventive) interventions are needed to help youth at risk to develop into adults that function well in our complex modern society.

**About Library and Information Services (LIS)**  

The service department Library and Information Services (LIS) service is responsible for the entire demand - supply chain in the fields of information management, IT and library services. In consultation with stakeholders, requirements are collected, prioritized and aligned. The service department consists of six Product Areas: Library and Open Science, Research, Education, Corporate, Data & Insights and Platforms. Product Area Research is looking to strengthen their Research IT team with a consultant for the department Mathematics and computer science.  

  

**About the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science**  

With over 110 (assistant, associate and full) professors, almost 300 PhD and EngD students, about 1500 Bachelor students and 1000 Master students, the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) is the largest department of the TU/e. By performing top-level fundamental and applied research, and maintaining strong ties with industry, M&CS aims to contribute to science and innovation in and beyond the region.  

The department’s relationship with the high-tech industry in the Brainport region means that interested staff and students can contribute directly to the development of technological innovations with real-world relevance. Several successful spin-offs have originated from the department and our staff participates in many national and international research consortia.  

  

**The postion**  

As a research IT consultant, you work in collaboration with researchers to develop fit-for-purpose, sustainable IT solutions. In addition, you provide (proactive) advice on how to translate functional IT requirements to technical products, services and workflows. You work in proximity of the department and its IT landscape, and have a pioneering role in setting up innovative (specific) solutions. You are part of a multidisciplinary team in which you share and learn from each other’s knowledge and expertise. This enables you to facilitate researchers at TU/e in conducting their research. You work for a department which fosters multidisciplinary research requiring highly specialized computational methods. With your broad range of interests and ability to oversee the complex landscape of interests and challenges, you facilitate the needs of research, so that scientists can focus on their most innovative work. You will also have the opportunity to build up an extensive network and to specialize in relevant research areas.


How this looks like in practice? Read the following section:  

  

**A typical week of a Research IT consultant at M&CS:**  

On Monday, you start the week together with the departmental IT support unit (“The Hub”) and review the current developments and your activities at M&CS. Together, you align on priorities and determine tactics for the best approach. In the afternoon, you visit a researcher who wants to scale up their computational jobs, by parallelizing the script to compute efficiently on the available resources. You advise them on what resources could be suitable for this use case and optionally get them in contact with expert support on this topic. At the same time, you notice you receive this type of question quite often, so you coordinate with the back-office to make sure we can support this type of request long-term.


On Tuesday, you work out a plan to facilitate in the IT requirements for a new Computer Science lab at the department, in alignment with the TU/e policies and frameworks for deploying IT. As development of this lab


might be interesting for the whole department, you prepare an agenda item for the department's IT committee. As you work in the same room with your fellow consultants in the afternoon, you can easily count on their help on how to approach this.


On Wednesday, you work at home and focus on developing and testing an IDE platform for specific applications that are needed for the Machine Learning group. You maintain a close feedback loop with the users and make agreements on structural support of the prototype. You inform your colleagues as they might also be interested in such a platform for their customers.


On Thursday, you meet the board during your regular check-in moment to report on the progress of their ‘research IT’.

-------------------


  
Binnen het Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM) ontwikkelt de Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) zich tot een sterke crisisorganisatie. Bij de LFI werk je nauw samen met ketenpartners binnen en buiten het RIVM in een politiek-bestuurlijke context. Een uitdagende functie waarin jij jouw flexibiliteit, wendbaarheid en talent om snel tot oplossingen te komen optimaal kunt inzetten. Als toegewijde Data Scientist die data-uitdagingen met passie omarmt en het maatschappelijk belang vooropstelt, die waardevolle inzichten levert door gebruik te maken van geavanceerde analysetechnieken en machine learning-algoritmen, waarbij je doelgericht modellen ontwikkelt, kun jij het verschil maken.

**Wat ga je doen**


De Data Scientists maken deel uit van het LFI datalab van het RIVM. LFI Datalab focust op het verzamelen en visualiseren van kerncijfers en KPI’s over de medisch-operationele processen voor de LFI. Deze cijfers bieden handvatten voor de LFI om de operatie, voor en tijdens een landelijke pandemie, nauwgezet te kunnen volgen. Daarnaast dienen de cijfers ter verantwoording ten tijde van A-infectieziekten die vragen om een landelijke aanpak. De cijfers zijn specifiek gericht op het ondersteunen van de LFI bij de regie op de medisch-operationele processen. Daarnaast ben je in de hele RIVM-organisatie aanwezig en kom je in aanraking met verschillende disciplines, zoals o.a. LFI operationele teams, RIVM Informatievoorziening, Stakeholders van VWS, GGD’en en RIVM. Je wordt van alle kanten bevraagd en bent betrokken bij veel projecten en programma’s.

**Een greep uit je taken en werkzaamheden:**


je bent verantwoordelijk voor het opstellen van duidelijke projectplannen en houdt nauwlettend toezicht op de voortgang ervan.


het automatiseren van informatie en het identificeren van patronen en trends behoren tot jouw taken, waarbij je waardevolle inzichten levert voor strategische- en tactische besluitvorming;


het integreren van data, processen en technologieën binnen en buiten de organisatie om bedrijfsprocessen te verbeteren en doelen te bereiken, is een van je prioriteiten;


je neemt actief deel aan verschillende projecten en processen, gericht op het verzamelen van informatie ter ondersteuning van de taken van de LFI;


het gebruik van geavanceerde analytische technieken en programmeertalen zoals Python, R en SQL om grote datasets te manipuleren en voorspellende modellen te ontwikkelen voor data-gedreven besluitvorming, is jouw expertise. Een voorbeeld is de IPC (van Diagnostiek en Behandelen) Integrale Plannings- en Capaciteit tool dat met behulp van Big Data, AI, modelleren en optimaliseren, prognoses, complexe data, machine learning optimaal voorbereid is op verschillende scenario's.


jij bent essentieel bij het implementeren van onze datalabfunctie, waarbij je op tactisch niveau meedenkt over de visie en daarnaast procesbeschrijvingen en werkwijzen vormgeeft;


met effectief stakeholdermanagement op diverse niveaus werk je samen met de business om de juiste functionele vragen te definiëren en geschikte datasets te identificeren, terwijl je nauw samenwerkt met technische experts;

**Waar staat de LFI voor?**


De Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) is een nieuw organisatieonderdeel van het RIVM. Het is de missie van de LFI om samen met haar ketenpartners de impact van de volgende pandemie op de volksgezondheid zo klein mogelijk te houden. Bij een infectieziektecrisis die een landelijke aanpak vereist, zorgt de LFI voor snelle opschaling en centrale aansturing van de medisch-operationele processen bij de GGD’en, zoals testen en vaccineren.


Om samen met de ketenpartners goed voorbereid te zijn, voert de LFI regie op onder andere het opleiden, trainen en oefenen van medewerkers en het maken van afspraken over informatievoorziening en snelle beschikbaarheid van grote aantallen medewerkers. Door de sterke verbinding met de GGD’en en het Centrum Infectieziektebestrijding (CIb) van het RIVM, kan de LFI snel opschalen bij een infectieziektecrisis.


De implementatie van de LFI is eind 2023 gestart en is naar verwachting eind 2026 voltooid. In deze periode geeft de LFI samen met GGD’en, andere onderdelen van het RIVM en het ministerie van VWS concrete invulling aan de ontwerpen voor onder andere aansturing, opgeschaalde diagnostiek en behandelen, grootschalig klantcontact, logistiek, scenario-ontwerp, crisiscommunicatie, informatiemanagement, inkoop, facilitaire diensten en financiën.

**Faculteit/Dienst:** Faculteit der Rechtsgeleerdheid
**Opleidingsniveau:** Master
**Functie type:** Promotieplaats
**Sluitingsdatum:** 22.09.2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13300
**Two PhD Positions in ERC Starting Grant project on multiple jobholders**  


AIAS-HSI/ University of Amsterdam invites applications for:  


**Two four-year PhD research positions in the ERC Starting Grant project “Moonlighting: Understanding the quality and consequences of working multiple jobs [MOONLIGHT]”.**  


The two PhD researchers will become part of the new, cutting-edge research project “Moonlighting: Understanding the quality and consequences of working multiple jobs [MOONLIGHT]”, funded by the European Research Council (ERC) for the period 2024-2029, and directed by Dr. Wieteke Conen.  


**MOONLIGHT project**  


The project studies the quality of work and wellbeing of contemporary multiple jobholders. Work in the new economy is increasingly of a flexible and fragmented nature. Multiple jobholders [MJHs], or so-called moonlighters, can be considered emblematic of how work fragmentation and combinations affect the quality of work and total worker wellbeing. MOONLIGHT will research the quality of work in first, second and other jobs and how this translates into total worker wellbeing. MOONLIGHT will study the quality and wellbeing of MJHs through comparative research in seven advanced economies: Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States - countries with increasing levels of MJHs, but different welfare state and labour market traditions, regulations and norms. The research will rely on new comparative cross-national and dynamic data. A full description of the project and all its subprojects can be found here.  


**Project 1: Dire straits**
This project will research precarious forms of moonlighting in seven advanced economies (Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States).  


The PhD researcher will start with a literature review on precarious forms of multiple jobholding, and integrate labour law analysis and policy analysis in the initial sections of his or her dissertation. The empirical articles will be based on analyses of the large-scale, international survey data and will investigate the measurement and classification of precarious forms of multiple jobholding, the quality of work among multiple jobholders, their characteristics, and the relation with their contexts. Research questions include: who are the multiple holders combining ‘bad jobs’? And how static or dynamic are dimensions of quality and total worker wellbeing across time? The final empirical article will be based on analyses of dynamic app data and analyses the stability or dynamics of the quality and total worker wellbeing among precarious multiple jobholders.
Supervisors: Dr. Wieteke Conen (AIAS-HSI/ UvA), Prof. dr. Maarten Keune (AIAS-HSI/ UvA)  


**Project 2: Career pathways**
This project will research transitions, career development and wellbeing of multiple jobholders in seven advanced economies (Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States).  


The PhD researcher will start with a literature review on human capital accumulation and skills diversification among multiple jobholders, and integrate policy analysis in the initial sections of his or her dissertation. The empirical articles will be based on analyses of the large-scale, international survey data on getting to a classification of quality of work and wellbeing among multiple jobholders and the influence of meso-level factors on prevalence, quality and wellbeing. Research questions include: how do industries, competition and organisations affect workers’ behaviour to start working multiple jobs? How do organisations enhance or deteriorate the quality of work and wellbeing of multiple jobholders? Under what conditions do multiple jobholders develop skills that can be transferred between jobs? How does human capital accumulation in one or more of the jobs affect later working life? The final empirical article will be based on analyses of the dynamic app data and analyses the embeddedness of multiple jobholding.
Supervisors: Dr. Wieteke Conen (AIAS-HSI/ UvA), Prof. dr. Joop Schippers (UU)

***Passionate about the scientific analysis of Cultural Heritage? Join us in building the next generation X-ray instrument for art and archaeology!***


Job description


The most advanced X-ray based techniques are availble at synchrotron radiation sources, such as the ESRF in Grenoble or DESY in Hamburg. Access to these extremely bright sources is limited, and Dutch researchers are in a disadvantageous position as the Netherlands are not directly involved in any of these centres of research. The Smart\*Light project (https://interregvlaned.eu/en/smart-light-2-0/) aims to make advanced X-ray analysis techniques available in the Netherlands. Several institutes in The Netherlands (TU Delft, TU Eindhoven, DIFFER) and Flanders (UAntwerpen, UGent) collaborate to develop a compact instrument that comprises an intense and energy-tunable X-ray source, X-ray optics and detectors. The source is based on the Inverse Compton Effect, where visible laser light, scattered by a relativistic electron beam, is promoted into the X-ray range, yielding a brilliant, coherent X-ray beam with a narrow bandwidth.



Your main task will be to build and commission the experimental endstation of Smart\*light. This endstation is meant for a characterisation of the beam and proof of principle experiments with a focus on cultural heritage objects (art objects or archaeological objects). This involves testing different components in the laboratory with X-ray tubes, verify their integration into the control software, determine spectroscopic figures of merit, optimize the instrument and demonstrate its capabilities in the first experiments. Based on the early experiments you will be involved in the planning of future Smart\*Light upgrades, especially regarding optics and beam shaping.



This work will be done within the team of the Alfeld Lab at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering of the Delft University of Technology. The Department of Materials Science is a diverse institution, working in small laboratories, headed by independent PIs on a range of topics, including optimising steel microstructure, corrosion, recycling and the investigation of cultural heritage. The Alfeld Lab is working on the multi-modal investigation of cultural heritage, with a special focus on X-ray investigations and the development of new instruments and data evaluation approaches.



You will work with the PI of the group, M. Alfeld, on the Smart\*Light endstation in the lab in Delft and with the team of the TU/e on the installation of the endstation in Eindhoven. It is possible to supervise Master students during the project and to pursue independent research endavours related to spectroscopy and/or cultural heritage.


Requirements


* You have experience in the operation and configuration of X-ray instruments for spectrometry, diffraction, imaging or similar techniques.
* You need to have a PhD in science (preferrably physics or chemistry) or engineering (materials science).
* You can work independently in an interdisciplinary environment with multiple stakeholders.
* You have at least moderate programming skills in python or the readiness to acquire these during the project.
* You have a good command of the English language, as you will be working in an international environment, and preferably of Dutch.
* You do not need to have worked with cultural heritage before, but it is a definite bonus.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



From 1 September next, a salary increase of 3.7% applies due to a Collective Agreement amendment, followed by an additional 1% increase on 1 January 2025. In addition, most employees employed on 1 September 2024 will receive a one-off payment of €300 gross based on full-time employment.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

Wij maken van Albert Heijn het beste omnichannel Food & Tech bedrijf en willen digitaal gemak voor iedereen. We testen en experimenteren, zijn innovatief en verleggen grenzen. Voor die reis hebben wij het Data Talent Track. Een track waarin wij jouw carrière als Data Analyst bij Albert Heijn een vliegende start geven binnen onze Digital Analytics afdeling. Is dit echt iets voor jou? Word dan de nieuwe Data Analyst in ons Data Talent Track!

  

  

**Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst ken jij onze klant het beste. Deze kennis verkrijg je door gebruik te maken van data (zoals bijvoorbeeld data over koopgedrag), om zo de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van data-oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk met de nieuwste data analytics technieken. Je maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Analytics & Data Science team, en bent daarmee onderdeel van de grotere Analytics community binnen Albert Heijn. Je beweegt makkelijk tussen Tech, Data Science en de business teams, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data analytics toepassingen. Je maakt impact als Data Analist door:

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

  



**Dit doe je als Data Analyst Digital**

Het Digital domein richt zich op digitale relevantie, experimentation, eCommerce en klantloyaliteit. Hiervoor voeren we data-analyses uit of ontwikkelen wij dataproducten om onze e-commerce en Digital-afdelingen te ondersteunen met inzichten rondom onze klanten, het verbeteren van e-commerce en het verbeteren van de customer journey. Denk daarbij aan projecten zoals het relevanter maken van onze aanbiedingen (Mijn Bonus Box) of marketing, inzichtelijk maken van de omnichannel customer journeys en het analyseren van onze spaarprogramma’s.

  



**Jouw ontwikkeling in het Data Talent Track**


Het Data Talent Track is een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen die je helpen om jouw professionele vaardigheden te ontwikkelen. Zo zijn er trainingen zoals persoonlijk leiderschap en het efficiënter schrijven van code, maar ga je bijvoorbeeld ook een dagje meehelpen in de winkel of bouw je mee aan de ideeën van de toekomst in een Hackathon. Wil je meer weten over hoe het Data Talent Track eruitziet? Neem dan vooral ook eens een kijkje hier.

 **Dit breng je mee**


Als grootste supermarkt van Nederland vullen we met meer dan 100.000 medewerkers dagelijks zo'n 5 miljoen borden. En als het aan ons ligt, doen we dat binnenkort ook samen met jou als onze Data Analyst. Zeker als je de broodnodige pro-activiteit en resultaatgerichtheid naar Albert Heijn meebrengt. Jij bent gedreven, staat sterk in je schoen en de ambitie spat van je af. Ook heb je:

* Een afgeronde wo-opleiding met data- en/of statistische basis zoals Econometrie, Operations Research, Wiskunde, Informatica, Business Analytics of Marketing Intelligence
* Ervaring met werken met grote databases (Python / PySpark / R / SQL)
* Ervaring met het oplossen van business vraagstukken met data analytics en/of Data Science technieken d.m.v. Python / R
* Ervaring met visualisatie tools zoals Tableau of Power BI is een pré


En, niet onbelangrijk, ben je:

* Proactief; je geeft zowel gevraagd als ongevraagd advies
* Sterk in het adviseren van de business en meenemen van stakeholders
* Communicatief sterk; je weet complexe informatie aan een niet-technisch publiek uit te leggen

 **De beste ingrediënten voor een betekenisvolle baan**

* Een salaris van max € 4000,- per periode van 4 weken (afhankelijk van je ervaring)
* Een winstuitkering oplopend van 45 tot 130% van je gemiddelde periodesalaris

We sparen samen voor een heel goed pensioen. En wij betalen ruim 5 keer zo veel als jij. Zo ben je ook later verzekerd van een goed inkomen* Je kunt 45 (ja, vijfenveertig) dagen vrij nemen; 25,5 vaste vakantiedagen en 19,5 ADV dagen. Veel plezier!
* Je ontwikkelt je even snel als de tech waar we mee werken. Dankzij feedback loops met de best & the brightest tech savvy collega’s. En door actief bij te dragen aan de AH Technology community – plons in een zee aan kennis en inzichten!
* Een moderne laptop en smartphone zijn ‘inbegrepen’. Bovendien hamster je kortingen. Op verzekeringen en je boodschappen bijvoorbeeld
* Je neemt deel aan het Data Talent track, een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen, en daarnaast heb je ook toegang tot onze AH Data Academy met nog veel meer trainingen zowel op hard- als soft skills. Jou een vliegende kickstart geven en de kans om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen vinden wij namelijk erg belangrijk
* Een werkgever die het beste van twee werelden combineert: de kansen die je met een corporate associeert plus de autonomie en de “to boldly go where no person has gone before” drive die scale-ups kenmerkt
* De kans om miljoenen mensen gezonder, lekkerder en makkelijker te laten eten

 **Solliciteer**


Klik op de sollicitatiebutton en ontdek hoe je dat, samen met enorm diverse én enorm enthousiaste collega’s, werkelijkheid maakt. We willen je daarbij vragen om geen standaard motivatiebrief te sturen, maar een antwoord te formuleren op de volgende vragen:

* Waarom zou je bij Albert Heijn willen werken?
* Waarom zou je graag bij Digital Analytics willen werken?
* Waarom denk jij dat je succesvol gaat zijn in deze functie? Vermijd woorden die in deze vacaturetekst staan en houd het persoonlijk

Wij verwelkomen iedereen, onafhankelijk van je achtergrond of geloof.

Jij vindt het leuk om aan complexe data-vraagstukken te werken. Je bent de spin in het web als het gaat om data extracten, transformeren en klaarzetten voor verder gebruik binnen organisaties, rekening houdend met de performance van de data-verwerking middels jobs die jij zelf configureert en beheert.

Het leren van nieuwe technieken is de reden waarom je dit werk hebt gekozen: nooit saai, en volop mogelijkheden.

Daarmee hebben we naam en faam gemaakt in verschillende sectoren en daar gaan we het liefst nog even mee door.

CINQ is opgesplitst in 3 business units met ieder een eigen expertise. Niet dat we ervan houden om in hokjes te denken, maar dit werkt in de praktijk nu eenmaal het beste. Ook voor onze klanten die een beroep doen op data engineers. Bij een klant meedraaien in een team tot aan het uit de grond stampen van een splinternieuwe dataomgeving: als dataspecialist komt er van alles op je bord.

Daarom doe je graag nieuwe kennis op en ben je creatief in het bedenken van oplossingen om klanten te verbluffen. Je bent nieuwsgierig, hebt een sterke klantfocus en kan zelfstandig uit de voeten. Dit breng je mee:

* Je kunt zelfstandig een data-omgeving ontwerpen, bouwen, en in gebruik nemen in een Cloud-omgeving (Azure, AWS, of GCP);
* Je hebt ruime ervaring met de ETL methode en weet nieuwe data op een efficiënte manier te verwerken tot bruikbare datasets;
* Certificeringen zijn geen eis, wel een pré;
* Python (en data-libraries zoals Pandas, Numpy, PySpark, Matploblib) lezen en schrijven is geen probleem voor je;

Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

Een rol met impact: die heb je als data-analist bij ons Sanctieteam in Utrecht zeker. Jij draagt bij aan een rechtvaardig en integer financieel stelsel. En tilt de Volksbank op het gebied van data naar een nog hoger niveau.


Jij speelt als de data-analist in ons Sanctieteam een sleutelrol in het screeningsproces. Dat doe je door op basis van requirements diverse databestanden te analyseren en zo afwijkende transacties en risicovolle (potentiële) klanten in kaart te brengen. Belangrijk, want bij de Volksbank willen we weten wie onze klanten zijn. Bijvoorbeeld om snel in te kunnen grijpen als we met iemand zaken doen die op een sanctielijst staat. Het aantal sancties en het aantal transacties groeien snel, waardoor een goede screening hoog op onze prioriteitenlijst staat. Daarnaast verandert wet- en regelgeving regelmatig.


Data zijn voor ons van doorslaggevend belang voor het kennen van onze (potentiële) klanten. Daarom werken we steeds meer datagedreven. Jij bouwt naast je analysewerk volop mee aan een datagedreven organisatie, waarbij je focust op een optimale inrichting van onze screening. Zo adviseer je over verbeteringen in onze systemen, processen en procedures om de screening zo effectief en efficiënt mogelijk uit te voeren.


Je krijgt veel vrijheid en autonomie, want wij werken agile. Jouw visie op data telt echt mee en is bepalend voor je team én de hele bank. Bij ons tref je ook de ideale omgeving om verder te groeien binnen jouw vakgebied. Verspreid over de hele organisatie werken namelijk data-analisten die je ontmoet in ons gilde. Hier delen we best practices en vragen we elkaar om hulp.


Hier kom je te werken


Het Sanctieteam is jouw thuisbasis. We zijn een multidisciplinair team van 16 collega’s: inhoudelijke experts, IT-specialisten en kenners van processen. In korte tijd zijn we gegroeid met veel nieuwe collega’s. Daar merk je trouwens weinig van; we werken samen alsof we elkaar al jaren kennen. We komen in elk geval één keer per week samen op kantoor in Utrecht.


Jouw kwaliteiten


Hoe jij bekend staat? Als doortastend en communicatief sterk. Zo vertaal je ruwe gegevens efficiënt naar heldere informatie waar je collega’s écht iets mee kunnen. Met je scherpe analytische blik ben je continu op zoek naar verbeterpotentieel. Bovendien werk je graag samen en houd je, ook onder druk, het hoofd koel.


Verder heb je:

* Hbo werk- en denkniveau
* Ervaring met grote datasets en het opschonen en transformeren van data.
* Ervaring met programmeertalen, zoals Python/PySpark, SQL en R.
* Ervaring met data-analysetools, zoals Excel en Microsoft Power BI of Jupyter.


Wat krijg je van ons?


Onze salarisschaal loopt van € 3.609,86 en € 5.553,63. Jouw salaris voor deze functie ligt tussen de € 4.165,22 en € 5.553,63 euro bruto per maand op basis van 36 uur per week.


Daarnaast kun je rekenen op:


* Een 36-urige werkweek, flexibel in te delen met bijvoorbeeld 4x9. 32 uur is bespreekbaar.
* Vakantiegeld en een dertiende maand, waarbij je via het individueel keuzebudget (IKB) zel kiest wanneer je dit ontvangt.
* 208,8 verlofuren o.b.v. fulltime dienstverband ongeacht je leeftijd.
* Een goede collectieve pensioenregeling.
* Alle vrijheid om zelf je ideale werkplek te bepalen. Thuiswerken is bij ons heel normaal.
* Een persoonlijk opleidingsbudget van € 750,- per jaar, naast de standaard opleidingsmogelijkheden.
* Iedere 5 jaar een budget van € 900,- om jouw thuiswerkplek in te richten.
* Een NS-Business Card én een vergoeding per km als je naar werk fietst.
* Een fietsplan om voordelig een fiets aan te schaffen.
* 2 werkdagen doorbetaald vrijwilligerswerk.
* Een vitaliteitsprogramma met workshops en coaching voor jouw mentale en fysieke gezondheid.
Een laptop en telefoon.

Als Data Engineer bij Macaw werk je samen met onze klanten aan het ontwerpen, bouwen en onderhouden van hun data platform, van bronontsluiting tot het beschikbaar stellen van data voor gebruikers. Daarnaast spelen ook orchestratie, beveiliging en adoptie van het platform een belangrijke rol in jouw functie. Wij werken met Microsoft technologie, dit betekent dat je aan de slag zal gaan met Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics en/of Microsoft Fabric. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams.

Jouw dagelijkse werkzaamhedenzijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van projecten bij kleinere organisaties waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig als engineer aan de slag kan gaan tot grotere bedrijven waarbij onderdeel bent van een groot projectteam waarin je samenwerkt met projectmanagers, solution architecten en ontwikkelaars. Onze klanten bevinden zich voornamelijk in Nederland en in Duitsland.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Microsoft Fabric, AI, Copilot, Azure Databricks, of wil jij je verdiepen in data strategie en data governance? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen en waar jij de mogelijkheid hebt om je kennis ook op andere gebieden verder te ontwikkelen. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan ons Smart Data Platform, een Data Platform accelerator die we intern ontwikkelen en onderhouden. Het doel van dit platform is om data platform projecten sneller en efficiënter op te starten door middel van referentie architecturen, standaardoplossingen, best practices en slimme herbruikbare laadpatronen. Het is inmiddels met succes ingezet bij meerdere van onze klanten.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* Wij zijn op zoek naar collega’s die houden van uitdaging en variatie. Elke opdracht die we bij de klant uitvoeren is uniek. Als medior ben je niet alleen bekend met de verschillende oplossingen en technieken, maar zie jij ook de kans om patronen te herkennen bij de klanten en daardoor de kennis en ervaring die je hebt opgedaan bij de ene klant toe te passen bij de andere klant.
* Je doet niet (altijd) wat er direct van je gevraagd wordt, maar probeert de onderliggende vraag te achterhalen zodat je op basis van die informatie een passende oplossing kunt bedenken.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een code zonder structuur is erg lastig te begrijpen.


**Wat ga je doen?**

(We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al 1-3 jaar werkervaring opgedaan in dit vakgebied in soortgelijke rol.
* Je hebt ervaring met het gebruik van Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks en/of Azure Synapse Analytics en weet hoe je deze technologieën kunt gebruiken op een efficiënte manier.

-----------------------------

  

  

In this role you will work on the business side of analytics. Next to your fellow data- analysts and scientists, you will work together with people from all over the supply chain organization. Your job is to transform data into value for them. Therefore, besides having a proper advanced analytics skillset, you should be able to understand the important drivers within the Supply Chain. Most of the time you will actively participate in cross-functional project teams. But sometimes you will work on something initiated by our own team in order to explore or challenge the status quo. This will be important for Action, our team, but also yourself in order to keep growing.


Your work will consist out of:

* building simulation models to simulate processes in our Supply Chain. These simulations help to understand the implications of possible changes and could trigger redesigns of processes. Simulating different put-away strategies is a good example that also lead to an actual change in our warehouse processes.
* building optimization models to define the most effective and efficient way of doing things. This includes linear optimization models as well as heuristics based solutions. A model which defines the optimal pick routes in our warehouses, is a perfect example of this.
* working on predictive and machine learning models, to better prepare for what’s coming. These models can be used in operations to plan for example their workforces, but they can also be used by process managers to (re)design their processes.
* performing complex (statistical) analysis to track relationships, understand effects of changes and find areas for improvement. You could think about cases such as ‘how much does congestion in the warehouses impact the productivity and what can we do to prevent that’.
**Meet your team**
------------------

  

As Data Scientist you will be part of the Supply Chain Support & Processes department and report directly to the Manager Supply Chain Analytics. SC Analytics is responsible for Business Analytics within the expanding European supply chain network of Action. The scope is End-to-End, so it will start at our suppliers, includes our hub-, cross dock- and warehouse network, and ends with the delivery at the stores. Working in the Supply Chain of Action means working in a dynamic and highly motivated environment that is constantly looking for improvements. How can we optimize our supply chain network? What is the most efficient and effective way of executing processes? Since there are more data- scientists and analysts working in the team you can team up with experience and knowledge to achieve the best results for Action and learn from each other.**This is you**
---------------

  

  

You have strong analytical skills with the ability to transfer business requirements into mathematical models, to provide solutions that deliver true value. You can transform complex data into actionable insights and are proficient in presenting it. You are a pragmatic thinker who works effectively with others to achieve common targets. Last but not least you have a good set of communication skills and are fluent in English.

*Furthermore you have:*

* Degree degree in a quantitative field such as Operations research, Econometrics, Applied Mathematics, Business Analytics, or equivalent
* 2-5 years’ work experience as data scientist. Experience in Supply Chain is a plus
* Experience with simulation- and optimization models is must (e.g. discrete-event modeling, local search heuristics and integer linear programming)
* Experience with statistical analyses, predictive modeling and machine learning is a plus (e.g. clustering, time-series forecasting, classification and regression)
* Experience in SQL, Python, PySpark, Databricks, Github, Azure DevOps, VS code is a must. Experience in C++ or AIMMS is a plus.

* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

  



**Dit doe je als Data Analyst Digital**

Het Digital domein richt zich op digitale relevantie, experimentation, eCommerce en klantloyaliteit. Hiervoor voeren we data-analyses uit of ontwikkelen wij dataproducten om onze e-commerce en Digital-afdelingen te ondersteunen met inzichten rondom onze klanten, het verbeteren van e-commerce en het verbeteren van de customer journey. Denk daarbij aan projecten zoals het relevanter maken van onze aanbiedingen (Mijn Bonus Box) of marketing, inzichtelijk maken van de omnichannel customer journeys en het analyseren van onze spaarprogramma’s.

Wij verwelkomen iedereen, onafhankelijk van je achtergrond of geloof.

Jij vindt het leuk om aan complexe data-vraagstukken te werken. Je bent de spin in het web als het gaat om data extracten, transformeren en klaarzetten voor verder gebruik binnen organisaties, rekening houdend met de performance van de data-verwerking middels jobs die jij zelf configureert en beheert. Daarnaast zit je boordevol ideeën hoe de omgeving te verbeteren, waarbij je steeds de klant centraal plaatst. Het leren van nieuwe technieken is de reden waarom je dit werk hebt gekozen: nooit saai, en volop mogelijkheden.

**Haak aan bij CINQ**

Daarmee hebben we naam en faam gemaakt in verschillende sectoren en daar gaan we het liefst nog even mee door.

CINQ is opgesplitst in 3 business units met ieder een eigen expertise. Niet dat we ervan houden om in hokjes te denken, maar dit werkt in de praktijk nu eenmaal het beste. Ook voor onze klanten die een beroep doen op data engineers. Bij een klant meedraaien in een team tot aan het uit de grond stampen van een splinternieuwe dataomgeving: als dataspecialist komt er van alles op je bord. En je collega’s van CINQ tref je bij een gezamenlijke data-kantoordag, kennissessie of memorabel uitje.

**Laatste check: jouw profiel**

De ideale kandidaat bestaat misschien niet. Toch zoeken we iemand die er dichtbij in de buurt komt. Want als data engineer ben je je ervan bewust dat jouw rol altijd in ontwikkeling is. Daarom doe je graag nieuwe kennis op en ben je creatief in het bedenken van oplossingen om klanten te verbluffen. Je bent nieuwsgierig, hebt een sterke klantfocus en kan zelfstandig uit de voeten. Dit breng je mee:

* Je kunt zelfstandig een data-omgeving ontwerpen, bouwen, en in gebruik nemen in een Cloud-omgeving (Azure, AWS, of GCP);
* Je hebt ruime ervaring met de ETL methode en weet nieuwe data op een efficiënte manier te verwerken tot bruikbare datasets;
* Certificeringen zijn geen eis, wel een pré;
* Python (en data-libraries zoals Pandas, Numpy, PySpark, Matploblib) lezen en schrijven is geen probleem voor je;

Zet jij onze bulk aan data om in waardevolle analyses en word jij enthousiast van het geven van goede, data-gedreven adviezen aan onze collega’s? Heb jij een passie voor retail? Dan zoeken wij jou als onze nieuwe Data Analist binnen AH Technology!

 **Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst Operations ontwikkel je oplossingen waarbij data (zoals bijvoorbeeld de data van winkel leveringen) wordt gebruikt om complexe vraagstukken te beantwoorden en de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van deze oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk je vanuit de nieuwste Data Analytics / Data Science technieken.  

Je beweegt makkelijk tussen IT/Data Science en de day-to-day business, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data-analytics toepassingen. In het Operations-domein ondersteun je onze winkels, supply chain en e-commerce Operations met analytics en data Science-oplossingen. Zo maken we onze operatie nog efficiënter en duurzamer met integrale supply chain-oplossingen en operationele procesoptimalisaties zoals routing, slotting en planning. Daarnaast helpen we voedselverspilling te verminderen door het maken van een geavanceerde demand forecast op winkel- en productniveau, of het bepalen van een dynamische korting voor artikelen die over de houdbaarheidsdatum dreigen te gaan.

 **Maak impact als Data Analyst door:**  

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies m.b.t. de operatie van e-commerce, winkels en supply chain
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse-aanpakken; je gaat creatief op zoek naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* Jouw verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen van data-analyses naar bruikbare inzichten
 **Dit breng je mee**  

Als grootste supermarkt van Nederland vullen we met onze 100.000 medewerkers dagelijks zo'n 5 miljoen borden.

* Een afgeronde WO-opleiding met data- en/of statistische basis zoals Econometrie, Operations Research, Wiskunde, Informatica of Business Analytics
* Circa 0 – 2 jaar werkervaring als Analyst of equivalent
* Ervaring met werken met grote databases (SQL / PySpark)
* Ervaring met het oplossen van business vraagstukken met data analytics en/of data science technieken d.m.v. Python / R. Dit is een must!
* Ervaring met object georiënteerd programmeren (Python/Javascript) is een pre
* Ervaring met visualisatie tools zoals Power BI is een pre
 **En, niet onbelangrijk, ben je:**  

* Proactief; je geeft zowel gevraagd als ongevraagd advies
* Sterk in het adviseren van de business en meenemen van stakeholders
* Communicatief sterk; je weet complexe informatie aan een niet-technisch publiek uit te leggen

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)
* Python en SQL

**Fijne pre's:**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**Stageopdracht | Hbo - Wo | SPECTO Aerospace | Amsterdam Lelystad Airport**

  

**""Het bouwen van een geavanceerd systeem waarin middels** Dynamic Augmented Reality technische informatie vanuit de echte wereld wordt toegevoegd aan een virtueel 3D vliegtuigonderdeel. **Die stap zetten we graag samen met jou!""**

  

Bij SPECTO Aerospace, een gecertificeerd luchtvaart-technisch bedrijf gevestigd op Lelystad-Airport en op de luchtmachtbasis in Woensdrecht, repareren we hoogwaardige composiet onderdelen voor de internationale luchtvaart- en defensie-industrie. Met een team van ongeveer 50 collega's werken we hard aan onze toekomst. Alles draait bij ons om vindingrijkheid, innovatie en kwaliteit en daarom zetten wij als onderhoudsbedrijf technologie-stappen die verder gaan dan de vereisten binnen de luchtvaartbranche. We zijn trots op ons vak en hebben allemaal hart voor de zaak. Samen gaan we voor het beste resultaat en helpen we elkaar waar nodig. Bij ons heerst een open en familiaire sfeer, waarbij onze kernwaardes gericht zijn op mensen.

  

**De Casus**



SPECTO is in feite een ambachtsbedrijf in een high-tech omgeving (www.spectoaerospace.com). Wij hebben ons ten doel gesteld om verregaand te digitaliseren. Niet omdat dat efficiënter is maar ook omdat ons dat gaat helpen om ‘het spel te veranderen’. In het reparatieproces van composiet vliegtuigonderdelen wordt standaard al een veelheid aan detailgegevens vastgelegd door specialisten en engineers en wij willen deze informatie in een 3D-omgeving gaan verwerken om hiermee in beelden te kunnen communiceren naar stakeholders (Visualization), om informatie tijdens het proces te ontsluiten en op te slaan (Digital Twinning) en om al deze data te kunnen analyseren om de volgende generatie vliegtuigonderdelen te kunnen ontwerpen (Data Analytics). Hiervoor willen wij onze schaal 1:1 3D-modellen gaan gebruiken die wij zelf met onze eigen geavanceerde scannerapparatuur maken van vliegtuigonderdelen

 **De Opdracht**

  

Wij hebben een Proof of Concept applicatie ontwikkeld waarin wij in staat zijn om vormen te tekenen op een 3D model en deze te linken aan onderliggende data. Deze applicatie is echter nog niet af: wij willen 3D kleur- en meetdata op een laagdrempelige manier kunnen opnemen vanuit de realiteit (fysieke omgeving) en deze vastleggen/overzetten als informatielaag op het 3D model in de virtuele omgeving. Voor deze opdracht is het een vereiste dat je sterke affiniteit dan wel ervaring hebt met werken met 3D technieken. Denk hierbij aan bijvoorbeeld fotogrammetrie technieken, Augmented Reality of UV-mapping.

 **Wat mag j****e verwachten van SPECTO**


* Een leeromgeving waarin we met je samenwerken en je echt onderdeel bent van het SPECTO Team!
* Flexibiliteit in werktijden en locaties
* Een marktconforme stagevergoeding
### **Vereisten**

**Wat verwachten we van jou als Stagiair?**

  


Jij bent een enthousiaste teamspeler die het leuk vindt om samen met ons op Lelystad Airport nieuwe oplossingen te bedenken, te onderzoeken, te bouwen én te testen. Je bent een creatieve denker en je hebt een passie voor nieuwe technologie en tools.

  

Verder vragen wij:


* Je volgt een studie in de richting Hbo ICT Software Engineering, Creative Media and Gaming Technologies of vergelijkbaar (3e of 4e jaar)
* Je bent bekend met onder meer Unity, C# en/of Java
* Werken met 3D modellen, fotogrammetrie en/of UV-mapping is een pré
* Je bent natuurlijk in staat om zelfstandig en gestructureerd te werken

Our alliance spans 70 countries and includes farmers and forest communities, companies, governments, civil society, and millions of individuals. Together we work to protect forests and biodiversity, take action on climate, and promote the rights and improve the livelihoods of rural people.

To protect nature and improve lives it’s becoming increasingly urgent that we approach the way we use our land and produce food and other products in more sustainable ways. For this to succeed we need to fundamentally change the way that businesses operate and source, and the choices we all make as consumers.

It’s important that we embrace this journey but also positively support each other. In practice, this can range from pair programming to travelling and celebrating together.

 ***We do it right:*** When you’re moving fast it can be tempting to constantly cut corners to things done. But this results in a product that is a struggle to work with and has unhappy users. We make that extra effort to be proud of what we’re building; understand the problem we’re solving, write one more test or tackle technical debt.

 ***We are empowered to act, challenge and lead:*** To work effectively as a team everyone must have a voice and feel they can stand up and be counted. As a software engineer at Returnista we want you to feel empowered. That could mean proposing new ideas, fixing things without seeking permission or challenging the CEO.

 ***We are intrepid:*** We want our engineers to show initiative and to innovate. Intrepid Friday’s give us the opportunity to work on things that might not ostensibly be the highest priority, but can make a big difference to our product or how we work.

-----------------


Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is offering a fully funded, four-year PhD-position, as part of the European Research Council (ERC) project “Where are the Humanities in the Medical Humanities? How Comics Can Improve Healthcare Training, Practice, and Dissemination” (2024-2029), led by Dr. Erin La Cour at the Faculty of Humanities. **The start date of the position is February 1, 2025.**


How can healthcare become more attentive to individual patient experiences? How can we *talk with* and *talk back to* practitioners and systems? What tools are needed to open productive dialogue?


This ERC project will critically elaborate the benefits of further integrating insights from the Humanities in the Critical Medical and Health Humanities by examining and expanding discourse on Graphic Medicine. A flourishing field that utilizes theoretical and artistic research practices in productive reciprocal exchange, Graphic Medicine is attentive to how the study and production of comics about health and healthcare echo calls within the Critical Medical and Health Humanities for the urgent need for different understandings and expressions of illness and disability than those found in conventional medical discourse. Focused on bottom-up, experiential knowledge, Graphic Medicine promotes comics as an important medium to depict interactions between individuals, their families and carers, a wide array of healthcare workers, and healthcare systems as scenes of intercultural, interdiscursive, and intergenerational encounter.


Through cross-national, cross-cultural, and cross-linguistic analyses of Graphic Medicine, from healthcare education to online information, and from individual artistic practices to collaborations between comics artists and healthcare institutions, this project will critically and comprehensively evaluate and develop the aims, current applications, and potential of Graphic Medicine across five individual subprojects. In so doing, it will also advance an understanding of creative practices as capable of critiquing and producing theory, will develop the discourse of what counts as healthcare knowledge, and will contribute to the aims of the Critical Medical and Health Humanities to offer new insights for healthcare training, practice, and dissemination.


**Graphic Medicine Online**


The PhD subproject, Graphic Medicine Online, will contribute to the overall aims of the ERC project through a comparative analysis of available online information on Graphic Medicine in English, Dutch, and French. Utilizing (and modifying) open-access data crawling software to aggregate available online information about Graphic Medicine in these three languages, including primary texts (comics) and secondary texts (theoretical and popular articles, blog posts, etc.), the PhD will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate how the discourse and practice of Graphic Medicine travels and shifts across national, cultural, and/or linguistic contexts. In so doing, it will create a comprehensive overview of Graphic Medicine in and across these three languages, and, through developing an online database of the project’s findings, will create an unprecedented resource for the advancement of research in the field.


*Key outputs of the PhD subproject:*


* An open-access and keyword searchable database of Graphic Medicine comics and scholarly and publicly-oriented articles on Graphic Medicine in English, Dutch, and French, including works translated into these languages, built from the aggregated information the PhD has collected, assessed, and keyword tagged (e.g. country of origin, language, translation, topic(s), perspective(s), discipline(s), target audience(s), source reliability, etc.). \*The database will be supported by a web programmer who will assist in preparing the backend database for a frontend website.
* A PhD dissertation on the project’s research methods and findings. Through a discussion of the project’s development of digital methods to create ways of finding, scraping, tagging, comparing, and translating the mentions of Graphic Medicine online in the three languages, and a visualization of the crawler’s trace to show the nodes of research and discourse, the PhD will develop theory through its method. The project will also seek to answer how much information is available and to which audience, how the discourse travels, and what shifts in meaning arise through translation into different national, cultural, and/or linguistic contexts. As such, the PhD dissertation will contribute to the field an engagement with the need for greater access to and dissemination of Graphic Medicine and the importance of accessibility to reliable healthcare information.


**Your duties**


* conduct research for and complete a PhD dissertation, as outlined above
* create an open-access and keyword searchable database of Graphic Medicine, as outlined above
* publish three (individually or co-authored) peer-reviewed journal articles or book chapters
* present research at national and international conferences
* collaborate with the team on research dissemination, including co-organizing workshops and conferences, and preparing a collected volume


**Your profile**

* you have demonstrable knowledge of and experience with digital methods, including data collection, quantitative and qualitative analysis, programming languages (e.g. Python, R), scripting and coding, and preferably, knowledge of and experience with natural language processing (NLP)

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

 **The Role**


Our mission at Netflix is to connect global stories with global audiences. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.


Recently, Netflix has expanded its entertainment offering to include Live content, like The Roast of Tom Brady Comedy Special, the SAG Awards ceremony, and The Netflix Slam tennis match. Our scope will grow to include premium live entertainment with our growing Live content catalogue, including WWE, NFL, and more.


Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips. This is made possible because Netflix UI is a thriving learning machine where Artwork & Video assets are personalized via reinforcement learning.

Given this data & insights rich landscape, we are looking for a highly motivated Senior Analytics Engineer to partner with business teams and product managers to empower how we create Artwork and Trailers. This is an opportunity for you to have direct influence on strategic decisions through technical and business thought partnership that will ultimately shape promotional content.

**As a Senior Analytics Engineer in this space, you will…**

* Be a strategic partner for Studio & Creative Production teams: identify critical analytical problems and apply an entrepreneurial mindset to find innovative solutions with data
* Being the lead analytics engineer partnering with our Product Creative Studio partners who are responsible for the promotional assets for Live content experiences.
* Drive the direction of your work, developing solutions that span from scrappy code and prototype tools to high-visibility dashboards and analyses for Studio & Creative Production leadership
* Spearhead the creation of new metrics that impact decision-making
* Collaborate with Data Scientists & Data Engineers to source data from new systems and strengthen our foundational data models

Bij ons heerst een open en familiaire sfeer, waarbij onze kernwaardes gericht zijn op mensen.

  

**De Casus**



SPECTO is in feite een ambachtsbedrijf in een high-tech omgeving (www.spectoaerospace.com). Wij hebben ons ten doel gesteld om verregaand te digitaliseren. Niet omdat dat efficiënter is maar ook omdat ons dat gaat helpen om ‘het spel te veranderen’. In het reparatieproces van composiet vliegtuigonderdelen wordt standaard al een veelheid aan detailgegevens vastgelegd door specialisten en engineers en wij willen deze informatie in een 3D-omgeving gaan verwerken om hiermee in beelden te kunnen communiceren naar stakeholders (Visualization), om informatie tijdens het proces te ontsluiten en op te slaan (Digital Twinning) en om al deze data te kunnen analyseren om de volgende generatie vliegtuigonderdelen te kunnen ontwerpen (Data Analytics). Hiervoor willen wij onze schaal 1:1 3D-modellen gaan gebruiken die wij zelf met onze eigen geavanceerde scannerapparatuur maken van vliegtuigonderdelen

 **De Opdracht**

  

Wij hebben een Proof of Concept applicatie ontwikkeld waarin wij in staat zijn om vormen te tekenen op een 3D model en deze te linken aan onderliggende data. Deze applicatie is echter nog niet af: wij willen 3D kleur- en meetdata op een laagdrempelige manier kunnen opnemen vanuit de realiteit (fysieke omgeving) en deze vastleggen/overzetten als informatielaag op het 3D model in de virtuele omgeving. Voor deze opdracht is het een vereiste dat je sterke affiniteit dan wel ervaring hebt met werken met 3D technieken. Denk hierbij aan bijvoorbeeld fotogrammetrie technieken, Augmented Reality of UV-mapping.

-------------------


The Department of Industrial Design of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), in cooperation with Philips Clinical Informatics is offering two fully funded 2-year positions to master graduates leading to the award of an EngD (Engineering Doctorate) degree in Designing Human-System Interaction.


**Societal urgency**


Access to high quality healthcare is under increasing pressure. Patient volumes are rising due to an aging population, and the amount of data from scans and image interpretation is increasing at a steeper pace than radiologists and pathologists can handle. Radiology leaders have raised alarm that labor shortages are leading to longer wait times and delays in treatment for patients. Never has there been a bigger need to relieve the pressure from staff. But how exactly do we make that happen?


**The challenge**


Adoption of radiology and pathology solutions is increasingly driven by the extent to which solutions “naturally” fit into clinical workflows and enable radiologists and pathologists to deliver quality at speed. This requires not only high-quality medical data and cutting-edge AI models. More so, clinical acceptance and adoption depends on solutions that are designed with a clear understanding of clinical workflows and usage patterns, and with the requirements that different clinical experts have on their tooling. Beyond functional requirements, successful clinical adoption needs highly intuitive solutions, seamless workflow integration (speed), and a great user experience. In sum, we face the overarching challenge of how to integrate AI-based clinical decision-making tools into clinical practice that is characterized by fast-paced, high-stakes decision-making informed by deep domain knowledge and year-long expertise.


Prototypes that are highly realistic in the eyes of the clinical user have shown to be an important “vehicle” to enable rapid co-creation with clinicians. It enables them to give meaningful clinician-centered direction to development complex technical tools. Are you ready to iteratively create such prototypes and shape them together with experts in the field?


**You are part of a learning community**


You will be strongly embedded in and work closely with a highly dynamic community with experts from different disciplines including designers, researchers, engineers, clinical specialists and business:


* You will work “in-tandem” with your fellow EngD team member. You learn from each other by bouncing-off ideas and taking turns at different steps in the design process.
* You will immerse yourself in the Philips Clinical Informatics business context working closely with the design teams on the latest technology developments in radiology and digital pathology, in close collaboration with hospitals and clinical end-users where the impact is made.
* The EngD program offers a personalized learning experience through a mix of courses, coaching and hands-on learning by doing.
* You will be surrounded by a team of fellow EngDs and PhDs that focus on human-AI collaboration in the healthcare domain.


**The two positions**


**EngD position 1 – The medical data visualization & AI designer**


In this position you dive deep into understanding the needs and workflows of the clinical end users and translate those insights into design concepts and interactive data visualizations. You express your ideas by creating clickable demonstrators together with your buddy “the creative technologist” (the second EngD candidate) and you enjoy using your user research skills to set up interviews and simulated use tests to collect user feedback, early and often.


Requirements

Design creation skills


* Strong conceptual design skills (translating user insights into concepts pushing the boundaries of the status quo)
* Affinity with UI, visual design skills, wireframes and clickable prototypes (e.g., Figma)
* Data visualization (next gen medical data & AI visualization)
* Interest in and understanding of AI (i.e., integration of AI in user journeys)
* Eye for detail and quality


Design research skills


* Enjoy experimentation with iterations based on user feedback and contextual insights
* Intermediate knowledge of user research methods (e.g., interviews, setting up and running small hands-on user tests with clinical end users, inquiries with stakeholders)


Soft skills


* Strong collaborator with multi-disciplinary team members and industry stakeholders
* Curious to know more about the healthcare domain and in obtaining a deep understanding of clinical end users in their daily work

**Team Code**


Team Code houdt zich bezig met ontwerpend onderzoek. We ontwerpen nieuwe technologie en nemen publieke waarden als uitgangspunt: technologie is namelijk niet zomaar een instrument, maar kan het (samen)leven van mensen diepgaand beïnvloeden. Code kijkt hoe technologie de positie van burgers kan versterken: democratisering door middel van digitalisering. Het team bestaat uit software ontwerpers, techniek filosofen en sociale wetenschappers.

**Over Waag Futurelab**


Waag Futurelab doet al bijna 30 jaar onderzoek naar hoe technologie kan worden ingezet voor sociale innovatie. Bekende projecten van Waag zijn o.a. Fairphone, de meest duurzame smartphone ter wereld of De Digitale Stad, een van de allereerste social media platforms van Nederland. Of denk aan Operatie Sigismund, een van de eerste educatieve games in Nederland die leerlingen laat ervaren hoe spannend een archief is en nog steeds wekelijks gespeeld wordt in het Drents Archief.


 Je toekomstige collega Ouarda vertelt over werken bij Waag*: ‘De vrijheid die ik van de organisatie krijg om mijn eigen projecten in te kleuren doet mij heel erg goed. Collega’s waarderen mij, ik kan mezelf zijn en dat maakt het een fijne werkplek.’*


Waag werkt in een team van ontwerpers, kunstenaars en wetenschappers, dat publieke onderzoeksmethoden toepast op technologie en de samenleving. Daarmee stelt Waag zoveel mogelijk mensen in staat mee te ontwerpen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Dat doen we door gezamenlijk opkomende technologie te onderzoeken en onderliggende culturele aannames te bevragen en door alternatieven te ontwerpen op basis van publieke waarden. Zo proberen we bij te dragen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Op waag.org vind je meer informatie over Waag en over de projecten waaraan wij werken.


Diversiteit is cruciaal om technologie en de samenleving meer open, eerlijk en inclusief te maken. Daarom moedigen we kandidaten van diverse culturele achtergronden aan om te solliciteren. Mocht je denken niet aan alle eisen te voldoen, willen we je toch aanmoedigen om te solliciteren. Sommige kwaliteiten zijn niet in bulletpoints te vangen.

**De rol in hoofdlijnen**  

Je gaat werken als journalist/redacteur voor **Assurantie Magazine (AM),** het grootste onafhankelijke nieuwsplatform voor financieel dienstverleners. Van verzekeraar tot hypotheekverstrekker en van schadebehandelaar tot pensioenadviseur; AM is al ruim 40 jaar de go-to nieuwsbron voor de verzekeringsbranche. Het is een competitieve, dynamische wereld vol botsende belangen, maar ook een branche met talloze mooie innovaties en maatschappelijke uitdagingen, zoals: hoe verzekeren we de energietransitie, en de steeds grotere cybercrime dreiging?


In deze rol:


* Draag jij met je spraakmakende, diepgravende artikelen en scoops bij aan structurele groei van het aantal betalende abonnees.
* Werk je voor AMweb.nl, waarmee je focus op digitale media ligt en je mede op basis van data je vervolgstappen bepaalt.
* Ben je binnen de redactie owner van je eigen dossiers die vallen onder belangrijke thema’s voor de verzekeringsbranche.
* Ben je als journalist actief betrokken bij de sector. Je kent onze doelgroep door en door, en je onderhoudt je netwerk goed.


**Het team**  

We zijn een divers team van ervaren redacteuren, werkstudenten, event organisatoren en sales collega’s. De redactie van vijf redacteuren werkt aan eigen dossiers binnen thema’s zoals Schade, Hypotheken en het Intermediair, maar is ook nauw betrokken bij de AM Top 100 en ons jaarlijkse grote event voor de branche: AMdag.



Onze redactie ontmoet elkaar een vaste dag per week op kantoor, dan hebben we met elkaar ook de wekelijkse inhoudelijke redactievergadering, en daarnaast spreken we flexibel af en werken we samen via Teams.  



  

  

**Wat breng jij mee?**


* Je hebt journalistieke ervaring, en een portfolio van artikelen en verhalen waar je trots op bent.
* Je bent nieuwsgierig, onderzoekend en kritisch en verdiept je graag in de hete hangijzers en trends binnen de branche.
* Je houdt van de afwisseling die werken op een redactie meebrengt, je vindt het leuk mee te denken over en te schakelen tussen het schrijven van nieuwsberichten en scoops enerzijds en inhoudelijke artikelen die diepgravend onderzoek vragen anderzijds.
* Je hebt kennis van de financiële dienstverlening, of bovengemiddelde interesse en de wil om snel alles te weten te komen over onze doelgroep.


**Ons aanbod**


* Bij VMN kom je om te leren, de ruimte om je journalistieke ideeën te realiseren, en voor de goede werk/privé balans. Wij werken hybride en je hebt veel vrijheid om je eigen werkweek in te delen.
* Wij organiseren veel sociale en inhoudelijke bijeenkomsten, waar je ook de andere VMN collega’s ontmoet, zo kun je leren van en ervaringen uitwisselen met andere journalisten/redacteuren en externe sprekers of trainers. Hoogwaardige journalistiek is de kern van onze organisatie: hierin investeren vinden we belangrijk.
* Een diverse en inclusieve werkomgeving, waar iedereen welkom is en waar we voortdurend werken aan het verhogen van ieders werkgeluk.
* Natuurlijk krijg je ook een goed salaris, een keuzebudget van 12%, een goed pensioen, 20 vakantiedagen per jaar op basis van 36 uur per week en de mogelijkheid om tot 3 weken extra vakantie bij te kopen vanuit je keuzebudget, een laptop en telefoon, reiskostenvergoeding (km) of OV Business Card.

**De rol in hoofdlijnen**  

Je gaat werken als journalist/redacteur voor **Assurantie Magazine (AM),** het grootste onafhankelijke nieuwsplatform voor financieel dienstverleners. Van verzekeraar tot hypotheekverstrekker en van schadebehandelaar tot pensioenadviseur; AM is al ruim 40 jaar de go-to nieuwsbron voor de verzekeringsbranche. Het is een competitieve, dynamische wereld vol botsende belangen, maar ook een branche met talloze mooie innovaties en maatschappelijke uitdagingen, zoals: hoe verzekeren we de energietransitie, en de steeds grotere cybercrime dreiging?


In deze rol:


* Draag jij met je spraakmakende, diepgravende artikelen en scoops bij aan structurele groei van het aantal betalende abonnees.
* Werk je voor AMweb.nl, waarmee je focus op digitale media ligt en je mede op basis van data je vervolgstappen bepaalt.

* Je houdt van de afwisseling die werken op een redactie meebrengt, je vindt het leuk mee te denken over en te schakelen tussen het schrijven van nieuwsberichten en scoops enerzijds en inhoudelijke artikelen die diepgravend onderzoek vragen anderzijds.
* Je hebt kennis van de financiële dienstverlening, of bovengemiddelde interesse en de wil om snel alles te weten te komen over onze doelgroep.


**Ons aanbod**


* Bij VMN kom je om te leren, de ruimte om je journalistieke ideeën te realiseren, en voor de goede werk/privé balans. Wij werken hybride en je hebt veel vrijheid om je eigen werkweek in te delen.

**Team Code**


Team Code houdt zich bezig met ontwerpend onderzoek. We ontwerpen nieuwe technologie en nemen publieke waarden als uitgangspunt: technologie is namelijk niet zomaar een instrument, maar kan het (samen)leven van mensen diepgaand beïnvloeden. Code kijkt hoe technologie de positie van burgers kan versterken: democratisering door middel van digitalisering. Het team bestaat uit software ontwerpers, techniek filosofen en sociale wetenschappers.

**Over Waag Futurelab**


Waag Futurelab doet al bijna 30 jaar onderzoek naar hoe technologie kan worden ingezet voor sociale innovatie. Bekende projecten van Waag zijn o.a. Fairphone, de meest duurzame smartphone ter wereld of De Digitale Stad, een van de allereerste social media platforms van Nederland. Of denk aan Operatie Sigismund, een van de eerste educatieve games in Nederland die leerlingen laat ervaren hoe spannend een archief is en nog steeds wekelijks gespeeld wordt in het Drents Archief.


 Je toekomstige collega Ouarda vertelt over werken bij Waag*: ‘De vrijheid die ik van de organisatie krijg om mijn eigen projecten in te kleuren doet mij heel erg goed. Collega’s waarderen mij, ik kan mezelf zijn en dat maakt het een fijne werkplek.’*


Waag werkt in een team van ontwerpers, kunstenaars en wetenschappers, dat publieke onderzoeksmethoden toepast op technologie en de samenleving. Daarmee stelt Waag zoveel mogelijk mensen in staat mee te ontwerpen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Dat doen we door gezamenlijk opkomende technologie te onderzoeken en onderliggende culturele aannames te bevragen en door alternatieven te ontwerpen op basis van publieke waarden. Zo proberen we bij te dragen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Op waag.org vind je meer informatie over Waag en over de projecten waaraan wij werken.


Diversiteit is cruciaal om technologie en de samenleving meer open, eerlijk en inclusief te maken. Daarom moedigen we kandidaten van diverse culturele achtergronden aan om te solliciteren. Mocht je denken niet aan alle eisen te voldoen, willen we je toch aanmoedigen om te solliciteren. Sommige kwaliteiten zijn niet in bulletpoints te vangen.

**Deadline:** 9 september 2024  

Mocht de geschikte kandidaat zich eerder melden, sluiten we de vacature eerder - dus wacht niet te lang met reageren!

**Vacature hoofdredacteur Arbo**

  

  

Van werkstress tot machineveiligheid en van hybride werken tot gevaarlijke stoffen. Arbo is het platform dat arboprofessionals ondersteunt in hun dagelijks werk. Door ze te informeren over ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken. Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.

  


**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.



Als hoofdredacteur Arbo ben je onderdeel van de centrale redactie van het ‘professionals portfolio’ van VMN media, waar ook PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb onderdeel van zijn. Samen zijn we een team van 14 personen.

 **Wat krijg je:**


* **Fijn team** – Leuke, betrokken collega’s die samen mooie content voor de doelgroep maken. Binnen het Arbo-team, maar ook in nauwe samenwerking binnen het professionals portfolio.
* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.



Verder nog handig om te weten: het gaat om een functie van 36 uur per week. Het kantoor van VMN media staat in Zeist.
