Then this is a great opportunity to join our team and help us to further****develop our forest research and forest resources models like EFISCEN-Space!**  

  

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research and modelling of European forest resources.  

  

An important element of our work is the development and application of European forest simulation models like EFISCEN-Space Such models aim to understand and visualize the role that European forests play for biodiversity, climate, soil, renewable resources and the environment, and how Climate-Smart Forest management can contribute to optimize this role. With these models, we help managers and various authorities (local, regional, national and EU) to evaluate and further shape European forest and climate policies.  

  

You will be responsible for the implementation and management support of current projects including the communication with EU project partners. This will be done in consultation with the project leader, and you will replace the project leader when needed in project related matters. You will actively engage in acquisition of new projects and develop yourself into an independent project leader. Together with the team you will further develop and refine various functionalities of the simulation models (e.g. forest management, harvest costs & revenues, biodiversity, soil carbon) and apply them in the projects.  

Besides this, you will also orientate yourself on developments in related (forest) ecological and forest management or monitoring disciplines. In the team and within projects, you contribute to model development, research, improving and interpreting research results together with other (senior) researchers and project leaders. You will also contribute to the acquisition of externally funded scientific research on Dutch and European forests in the context of (climate) policy and management studies. Depending on your level of experience also supervision of more junior researchers will be part of your work.

A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:* working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;
* the option to accrue additional compensation hours by working more;
* sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
* there is a strong focus on vitality and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
* a fixed December bonus of 8,3%;
* excellent pension scheme.

Join ReBioClim, a Project Aiming to Pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in Four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.
* Ability to work independently and in a result-oriented way.
* Availability to start in January 2025.


Nice-to-haves:


* Experience in conducting geospatial analysis in a programming environment such as R or Python.
* Knowledge of co-design workshop methodologies.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

Join ReBioClim, a project aiming to pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.

**Background**


Within ING we make use of data science for a variety of use cases (such as improving financial health of our customers by transaction forecasting). The data science models which run in production all generate output this data needs to be delivered to different destination within ING. These destinations vary from data lakes and kafka topics to Cassandra datastores.


In the past a generic Interface format (GI) was developed as a one size fits all solution to standardize the output delivery for our data-scientists. Over time many models have adopted this interface but we are now facing challenges such as files which became too big or the throughput time is too long.

**The opportunity**


We would like to deep-dive into this topic by dedicating an intern as engineer to investigate our use cases and look for a future proof solution. This includes gathering information, do market research (buy vs built) and design / develop one or more prototypes together with our data-scientists data engineers.

**Team** **overview**


You, as an intern will join one of our data-engineering teams which support the ING data-scientists. The teams work on a variety of topics to maintain and evolve our data-analytics environment in Google Cloud.

* Located in our Amsterdam office.
* Mix of local and off-shore colleagues (so multiple nationalities)
* We work in agile teams based around Scrum and continuous delivery principles.
* Our teams work in hybrid mode, we work from home when possible and work from the office at least one day a week.
* We have 36 hour working weeks.

**Roles and responsibilities**


This assignment is about understanding and improving our way of distributing data-science model output. The current implementation of GI (Generic Interface) needs to be examined as well as our use cases and the industry standards available. The goal is to boost new alternatives and bring us further in achieving an excellent data-driven organization.

**Expected l****earnings**

You will be working in an environment with modern continuous delivery tools with people who have a continuous improvement mindset. Tools include Azure (CDaaS), Google GCP (Terraform, Vertex AI, BigQuery), NiFi for data flow management.


Working in a complex environment such as ING can be challenging and this is part of the learning and our people and teams are there to help you.


Communication and collaboration are key and this involves working closely together with domain experts such as data-engineers, data-scientists and machine learning engineers.

**Expected output**


An inventory of required features, an improved understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the current implementation and a redesign plus implementation plan (part of this can also contain a buy vs built decision or a vendor selection).


When time allows the output also consists of the implementation of a prototype solution.

**How to succeed**


You can succeed in this role by showing:

* a “can-do” mentality
* you are a “self starter” (pro-active)
* you speak out and like to challenge yourself and the people around you
* you have a background in IT, information management or similar
* experience and affinity with machine learning is very useful
* it helps if you like programming (python, java, scala) though this is not a show stopper

**Rewards and benefits**  

This is a great opportunity to train with highly skilled people who are experts in their field. You’ll do a lot and learn a lot –  

not only about your specialist area and the bank, but also about yourself and whether this type of environment is right for you.

  

You’ll also benefit from:

* Internship allowance of EUR 700/month for 36 hours (maximum)
* Compensation of travel costs
* Your own work laptop
* Hybrid working to blend home working for focus and office working for collaboration and co-creation

**Why?**

Every swipe, every like, every TikTok video we upload, every Zoom call we have, every Netflix video we watch, or everything we buy online is all processed and depends on… data centers. However, these data centers consume large amounts of energy due to the underlying technology we use every day all day.

**How?**

We have developed an AI-based analytics platform that captures the entire data center (DC) infrastructure—""from roof to room""—to bring the whole DC into a more optimal state. This platform saves energy, water, and scope 3 emissions while increasing reliability and sustainability in data centers across countries like Germany, France, the UK, Australia, and The Netherlands.

We seek a highly qualified **Data Science Lead** with extensive experience in setting up and scaling machine learning infrastructure, processes and teams.

Being our Data Science Lead, you will be extremely important in integrating our ‘AI First’ principle within our global platform in 4 ways: people, processes, systems and models.

You will drive the design, development, deployment, and maintenance of scalable data science processes and systems. You’ll hire and manage a diverse (and potentially global) team of data scientists who support our mechanical data analysts in translating the complex context of a data center into effective and efficient (ML) models while speeding up the development and deployment process into a lean machine. Your outstanding and in-depth knowledge of (the latest) ML/ AI architectures and techniques allows you to make trade-offs in applying effective models to our data center optimization platform.

**Additionally you will**

* Be able to perform hands-on model development and deployment activities.
* Work closely with the AI research team to quickly identify new and potentially impactful developments in ML and AI.

 Apply Now
***This position seeks a junior scientific programmer to further develop and integrate existing movici and multi-model.nl platforms and support the development of new (multi-)models of infrastructure interactions. The work will be done in close cooperation with PhDs, postdoc, senior experts on modeling theory and decision-making and practitioners from infrastructure providers. This position can potentially be turned into a PhD postion.***


Job description


Infrastructures provide the basis for many critical societal processes, from economy to education, from healthcare to housing and more. The infrastructures are increasingly interdependent on each other, from providing mutual services (like energy and data for mobility), via to providing alternative capacity (like rail, road and waterways), to competing for the same space (like in urban contexts).



Models and simulations are key tools for decision makers, allowing them to build, design, and plan infrastructures. As the need for integrated, cross system insight rises, current monodisciplinary and mono-sectoral models are increasingly unable to provide the required insights. A promising direction is multi-modelling, where different models and simulations are combined in an ecosystem of tools, that can be used and re-used in different configurations. The model ecosystem, and the socio-technical approach to modelling poses new methodological and technical challenges.



Models are instrumental for supporting the social process of decision-making, and are not a goal in themselves. Key model and software requirements will stem from the users and the social process that they are involved in. You, as a developer will be involved in these processes where needed, but are not expected to organize and manage them.



Work will consist of two main lines, platform development and model development support. Platform development involves integration of existing open-source platforms MOVICI and multi-model.nl, identifying new requirements and features from the users and developing them. Model development includes software implementation and general computing and data analysis support for researchers, modelers and modelling and simulation theorists. You may also be asked for advice on the most suitable software solutions, data structures, architectures, code redesign where necessary.



Goal of the position is the further development of the MOVICI and multi-model.nl platform towards a tailored tool for broad impact analysis in a complex stakeholder environment. The later means a lot of attention for describing and modeling scenario’s, a wide range and flexible approach towards evaluative criteria for these scenario’s, clear visualizations in space and time on scenario development, and interconnection with other modeling platforms.



We are looking for a person who enjoys (re)design and implementation ""done right"", with long term maintainability, reusability and generalizability being important, without losing sight of practicality. Willingness to work closely with domain experts and modeling theorists is paramount. Correct and clean representation and implementation of the relevant concepts is much more important than churning out features quickly. You will be working in research focused academic setting, so affinity with science, scientific methods and processes is useful.


Requirements


The software stack is organised around open source workflows: git, python, docker, Apache Airflow, linux shell and some C++. We also make use of REST interfaces and client-server architectures where relevant. Prior experience with these technologies is desirable but is explicitly not expected. We do expect solid python programming ability, high level of general computing skills and eagerness to learn more, as well as a good command of the English language. Dutch proficiency is desired but not necessary.



This is a junior position, and your interests, willingness to learn and team fit are much more important than prior experience with specific technologies.



We are seeking a recent graduate from a computer science/ computer engineering / programming and/or data science-oriented MSc program, but candidates with different background are also encouraged to apply. The position could in term be changed to a modeling and simulation focused PhD position.



We expect that you will take the initiative, be independent and can handle a high degree of freedom, especially in the technical domain. However, you will not be left alone to “figure it all out by yourself”. You will be part of a team that takes personal development and growth, mental health and neurodiversity seriously. You will be working closely with Dr. Ir. I Nikolic, and Prof. Dr. W. Veeneman.

Then we have an opportunity for you.

  



**Job Description**  

In the plastic packaging value chain, there is only limited information available on the plastics in that chain to assess circularity and recyclability goals, especially the use of post-consumer recyclates (PCR) in packaging.

  


Quality specifications, monitoring, and standardisation of materials are common in certain industries like chemistry and pharma but are, at this point, only in an infancy state in plastic waste management. A major challenge when it comes to mechanical recycling of plastics is that the quality of the material is not monitored throughout the whole process. Inline monitoring is however essential for predicting the final quality of PCR.

  


In the MoQuP-R project, we focus on the necessary quality monitoring tools and the application of existing models related to the prediction of recyclate quality in order to increase the use of PCR in packaging. In this project your responsibilities will entail:


* Review literature to identify potential inline analytical methods to monitor quality parameters.
* Adapt laboratory and/or offline analytical techniques to be used inline in polymer processing equipment.
* Propose and execute design changes to polymer processing equipment to enable inline measurements.
* Design experiments using polymer processing equipment and post-consumer plastics to apply and develop monitoring tools.
* Evaluate the different methods in relation to PCR quality.
* Manage a work package in the MoQuP-R project.
* Present your work at international conferences, MoQuP-R consortium meetings, and other events and write scientific papers for international peer-reviewed journals.
* Provide teaching assistance and/or supervision of researchers and students.

  




As a Postdoctoral Researcher you will work in the Circular Plastics team in the Faculty of Science and Engineering located at Brightlands Chemelot Campus in Geleen. You will become part of a young international research group, specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics with a strong polymer science background. Your will work together with Rudinei Fiorio on this exciting topic.

  


**Requirements**  

We expect you to have the following experience, knowledge, and skills:


* A PhD degree in mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, process analysis, mechatronics, or similar;
* Advanced skills in CAD and interfacing sensor data to analysis software (e.g. Python, Matlab, Simulink);
* Good knowledge on analytical techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, GCMS;
* Skills in polymer processing;
* Experience with industry collaborations is considered advantageous;
* Proficiency in both written and spoken English.

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.
* Masters degree, PhD or equivalent experience in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, etc.).
* We prefer candidates with Deep Learning experience, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. Experience with TensorFlow is a plus.
* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).
* Excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal; the ability to convey your message to team members and other collaborators.

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.
* Masters degree, PhD or equivalent experience in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, etc.).
* We prefer candidates with Deep Learning experience, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. Experience with TensorFlow is a plus.
* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).
* Excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal; the ability to convey your message to team members and other collaborators.

### **Benefits & Perks****: Global Impact, Personal Relevance**


Booking.com’s Total Rewards Philosophy is not only about compensation but also about benefits. Our Total Rewards strive to make it easier for you to experience all that life has to offer on your terms so that you can focus on what really matters.

Then this is the perfect job for you!
  
Knab was founded in 2012. We are an online bank, but one run by real people. We are known for being different because we want to do things differently. Simpler, smarter, and more affordable for our customers. By combining smart technology with a healthy dose of common sense, we create financial services that meet your needs. We add sublime, personal service to this, creating something unique in the financial sector.  

  

**Your role and responsibilities**  

Are you passionate about problem solving and combining the use of different tools in your daily work? And are you interested in the interest rate risk and enjoy improving processes? As a Senior ALM Specialist you will be responsible for managing and modelling interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) in a small and engaged team.  

  

Furthermore, the role will include at least the following:


* Managing the interest rate risk through hedging and designing optimal risk steering;
* Developing and refining interest rate related models (e.g. non-maturing deposits, cash flows, prepayments, mortgage pipeline, hedge accounting);
* Shaping decision-making, policies and analyses for senior management;
* Reporting the IRRBB and FX position to ALCO;
* Staying up-to-date with the latest changes in regulation (i.e. EBA, BCBS 239) related to IRRBB management;
* Enhancing reporting processes with regard to the automation and quality of the reported data;
* Assisting junior team members in their professional development.


The current interest rate environment and changes in EBA IRRBB regulation make it a very dynamic and exciting time to be part of a first-line of defence ALM team. The combination of the current economic climate, a flat-structured bank and a wide range of projects offer you a great opportunity to grow professionally and develop a holistic view on interest rate risk of the bank.  

  

**The team**  

The Asset and Liability Management & Methodology (ALM&M) team’s goal is to deliver on Knab’s strategy by optimizing the balance sheet of Knab. We do this by ensuring that the interest rate risk and funding positions of Knab are managed within the boundaries set in the strategies for those risks whilst not losing sight of the profitability of the bank.  

  

We believe in assigning ownership instead of tasks and, as a result, everyone within the ALM&M team gets the chance to own and be in the lead of a focus area within our team. This creates a flat structure which enables people to take initiative and develop their professional career on their own terms.  

  

On a personal side, we are a fun and multi-national team of curious and knowledgeable people. We perceive work as a challenge to improve ourselves and the bank. We like to work together and learn from each other through regular knowledge sharing sessions. We also enjoy spending time together outside of the work (e.g. having a drink or a game of padel.  

  

**Your profile**  

To be successful in this role, this is the kind of traits we have in mind:


* Completed masters degree in (Quantitative) Finance, Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics or similar;
* 5-7 years of relevant working experience in financial modelling, ALM or balance sheet management;
* Experience with Python, R, VBA (Excel) or C++ is a must, SQL is a plus;
* Experience with ALM / risk software solutions such as QRM or Ambit Focus is preferred;
* Ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and concise way;
* Self-starter with the ability, agility and motivation for self-learning;
* Excellent control of the English language, both written and verbally. Dutch is a bonus.


Did you know that according to research, women are less likely to apply than men when they don't meet all the job requirements? What a shame. Because, in our view, 'the perfect candidate' is a myth. So, if you have the drive to grow in aspects of this role, we look forward to your application.  

  

**This is Knab and this is what we offer you**  

Come as you are. Knab is an open workplace with positive vibes. We are inclusive of all nationalities, races and genders. We feel comfortable to bring our authentic whole selves to work and like you to do so too.  

  

If you come to work with us, Knab will become a significant part of your life. Therefore, we make sure the ambiance is just as exciting as your job. If you have any questions regarding this role or the process, please feel free to reach out to us.

=====================

* **We are on a mission** to make programming biology easy. We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.
* We're an **experienced team**. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!
* We're focused on building the **best possible team culture**. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.
* We offer **top of the market** salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.


**Responsibilities**:


As a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:

* Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools
* Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations
* Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process
* Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain
* Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.
* Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem

**Need to haves**
=================

* Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills
* You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.
* You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer\*, or even implement a UI plugin.
* You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.
* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**
=================

* Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.
* A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.
* You have worked with databases or big data systems.
* You have designed user interfaces and are familiar with one or more of the popular frameworks.
* You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.
* Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Cradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.**  

  

We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.


You will be joining a high-growth, highly ambitious startup with an experienced founding team, whose motivation is building a more sustainable world using biology. We are backed by some of the most well known investors and industry veterans. Joining us now means you will be getting in on the ground floor; you will have a significant impact on how we shape the company, and success will mean an outsized reward.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

The sub-team focusing on ESG Data has been active for almost a year. As a member of this team, the goal is to collaboratively build an ESG Data platform with IT Developers to supply the team involved in Sustainable Finance Regulation Modelling with the necessary data to monitor ESG risk.  

  

Given the significance that regulatory authorities attribute to modelling and the underlying data, this role is challenging and impactful. The Sustainable Finance Regulation project is a new and excellent opportunity to become familiar with this development. Tasks related to this project, which involve building the platform, include:

* Collection of all data requirements for the models;
* Gap analysis of the data requirements for the SFR regulation and the data already available on the platform;
* Planning of the delivery of the required data;
* Actual delivery of dataset to the consumers.


  

Once the platform is ready, you will be involved in the data collection process. Your duties will encompass technical aspects such as SQL and Python programming, performing Data Quality analyses, and integrating datasets. Simultaneously, you'll be working on documentation and utilizing your communicative skills for stakeholder alignment. Active participation in frequent team meetings, where knowledge-sharing and progress transparency are key, is also expected. In this role, everything revolves around data modelling, along with related activities:  

  

* Discussing data requirements for different ESG risk models and reports with the modellers and reporting analysts;
* Make an inventory of the relevant databases within the bank and gain access to them;
* Combine tables (merge / link) and aggregate data in SQL and Python;
* Apply Data Quality Analysis, for example, course over time, missing values, extreme values;
* Investigate the plausibility of the new data;
* Document the data sourcing process and descriptive statistics and discuss this with the business parties;
* Additionally, there are many ad hoc activities, and you will regularly participate in cross-departmental projects. Your ability and willingness to collaborate are crucial for success in this role. You naturally take initiative, organize work effectively, and eagerly work with others to deliver tangible results. You possess a practical, analytical approach and strong communication and presentation skills. Being a robust team player, you take responsibility for your work. In the dynamic environment in which you operate, you have the ability to get all stakeholders on board.

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=0c48e3966dd23e85,indeed,Site Reliability Engineer (DevOps),Vattenfall,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Vattenfall,"Amsterdam, NH, NL",fulltime,2024-07-23,,,,,False,,,ewa.krajewska@vattenfall.com,"**Over de functie**
-------------------

 **Do you want to commit to a critical challenge and help to shape our future?**


We keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages, and configuration errors.


We are looking for a team member who is driven by technical challenges and the urge to always find better and more efficient ways of delivering services to the customer.  

  

**What will you do?**


In the role as SRE engineer you will combine the skillset of dev teams and operations teams by applying a software engineering approach to IT operations.


To succeed in this role it is important that you are self-driven, exact, analytic, critical and know how to prioritize. You are not only an expert in your field but you also have social competence and understand the business needs. You always challenge yourself and others to improve. You are also open for suggestions from others and can also give your own.


You are a team player and have a hands-on mindset, a strong customer- and problem-solving orientation. You show fast results, and you have demonstrated good communication skills, especially in an international organization. You need to be able to work independently in an international team that meets more virtually than physically.

  

  

**Your tasks and responsibilities:**

**Maintaining Applications to Help Operations and Support Teams**


As a SRE you are in charge of proactively implementing and maintaining infrastructure and business applications. This can be anything from provisioning servers, updating systems, deploying new software, providing pre-emptive maintenance to monitoring and alerting to code changes in production. A site reliability engineer can be tasked with building a homegrown tool from scratch to help with weaknesses in software delivery or incident management.


You must always be looking to improve quality and efficiency and cut costs.

**Fixing Support Escalation Issues**


Similarly to the point above, a site reliability engineer can be expected to spend time fixing support escalation cases.

**Optimizing On-Call Rotations and Processes**


More times than not, site reliability engineers will need to take on-call responsibilities and improve system reliability through the optimization of on-call processes. You will help add automation and context to alerts – leading to better real-time collaborative response from on-call responders. Additionally, you will update runbooks, tools and documentation to help prepare your on-call team members for future incidents.

**Documenting “Tribal” K****nowledge**


As you gain exposure to systems in both staging and production, as well as all technical teams, you will take part in work with software development, support, IT operations and on-call duties – meaning you will build up a great amount of historical knowledge over time. Instead of keeping this knowledge in the mind of one team or one person, as SRE you are expected to document much of what you know. Constant upkeep of documentation and runbooks can ensure teams get the information they need right when they need it.

**Conducting Post-Incident Reviews**


Without thorough post-incident reviews, you have no way to identify what’s working and what’s not. As such you will be participating in post-incident reviews, documenting your findings and taking action on your learnings.


Maybe also add \""provision new servers\""... it is attractive to have a more technical approach to woo away developers and coordinators!

 **Location**  

  

Katowice, Gliwice, Amsterdam or Solna

**Jouw profiel**
----------------

 **Who are you?**  

  

As our Site Reliability Engineer you:

* Are an expert in your field, strong technical and analytical skills, can solve impossible problems.
* Have the ability to translate complicated technical matters into simple understandable language.
* Have experience in building and operating of server virtualization environments.
* Have thorough knowledge of operating systems (Linux/Windows 2019 and up).
* Work with Agile methodology.
* Have experience in troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
* Are able to deal with tight deadlines when they arise.
* Have automation experience with at least one configuration/deployment management system (Ansible, Jenkins pipelines, Azure DevOps…).
* Have experience with at least one of the following scripting languages (Powershell, Shell, Python…).
* Have experience working with GIT.
* Have experience developing CI/CD.

  

Next to this you bring:

* Experience in a large international environment is desirable.
* Experience with containers is a plus.

**Extra informatie**
--------------------

 **Our offer**  

Good remuneration, a challenging and international work environment, and the possibility to work with some of the best in the field.

**Meet the team behind this journey**



We are looking for a technical lead for our DevEx function. Working with a team of around 20 people, you will be responsible for building a strong Developer Experience function within the company.



The teams are the amalgamation of the former core DevEx team, the Web Platform team and the Backend Tooling team, which were recently merged to focus on the overall mission of delivering a world-class developer experience.



You will be working as part of the Olympus Unit which provides production and platform engineering services to the whole engineering organisation.

 **Your Responsibilities**

  

It all starts with our vision of a strong Developer Experience and enabling teams to work at their best.



You collaborate with the engineering teams across the organisation to understand their needs and come to data-driven decisions on how to improve our engineering department. We want to allow every engineer to perform to the best of their ability. Giving them the right tools and spreading knowledge internally is your mission.


**People Leadership** To lead the DevEx organisation, you’re directly responsible for a small number of Engineering Managers and their teams, guiding the EMs in their growth and providing strategic direction.


**Managing Growth** Within the overall operations department, we aim to scale better than the overall growth of the business. You will contribute to this goal by enabling our engineers to deliver more. With our constantly evolving product landscape, you'll never run out of challenges!


**Strategic Leadership:** Responsibilities include leading the strategic direction of the team's engagements and collaborating with stakeholders. While not directly involved in software delivery, the role necessitates a profound understanding of technical architecture, potential challenges, and aligning the team's work with broader organisational goals.

 **Qualities we look for**

* Significant experience in leading Developer Experience roles, focusing on improving DORA metrics
* Leading leaders: The team currently has two engineering managers who will report to you
* Strong engineering background, bonus points if parts of our stack are included:


* C#/.NET with ASP.NET, C++, Typescript, Python or Go
* Machine learning
* Open source platforms based around Kubernetes
* Observability based on open source Grafana stack or comparable
* Data Science tooling (e.g. batch workload systems, streaming analytics systems etc.)


* Experience of initiating and driving large technical projects involving collaboration with multiple teams across an organisation
* 10+ years of hands-on technical experience as an engineer, including experience in large-scale organisations
* Demonstrated ability to influence and mentor teams and individuals across multiple departments or larger organisational structures
* Proactive and proficient in communicating with stakeholders in English, ensuring clear and effective interactions
* Experience with a wide range of observability practices (SLOs, Dashboards, Alerts,..) for business-critical systems

 **What we offer**

* **Diverse and internationally distributed team**: joining our team means becoming part of a large, global community with people of more than 90 nationalities. We're more than just colleagues; we're a group of professionals with a shared mission to connect diverse cultures. Our global presence is growing–we've doubled in size nearly every year, with our employees based in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the US, and Japan, and we continue to expand our network.


* **Open communication, regular feedback**: as a language-focused company, we value the importance of clear, honest communication. We value smooth collaboration, direct and actionable feedback, and believe that leading with empathy makes us better together.


* **Remote work, flexible hours**: whether you're near or in our hubs in cities like Cologne, Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Austin, or Tokyo, or prefer the comfort of your own home, you decide where your office is. We offer remote opportunities, flexible working hours and trust in your productivity, all in sync with your team's general locations and time zones to foster effective and seamless collaboration. Our aim is to integrate your work with your lifestyle, ensuring a balance that respects both your needs and our operational requirements.


* **Regular in-person team events**: we bond over vibrant events that are as unique as our team, from local team and business unit gatherings, to new-joiner onboardings and company-wide events that bring us all together–literally.


* **Monthly full-day hacking sessions**: every month, we have Hack Fridays, where you can spend your time diving into a project you're passionate about and get the opportunity to work with other teams–we value your initiatives, impact, and creativity.


* **Comprehensive health insurance**: your health comes first. With our comprehensive insurance, we'll make sure you're covered from head to toe.


* **30 days of annual leave**: we value your peace of mind. With up to 30 days off (excluding public holidays) and access to mental health resources, we make sure you're as strong mentally as you are professionally.
* **Annual learning budget**: because we never stop learning, we’ve set up an annual budget for your professional development—pick a learning path which contributes to your career development and we'll back you up.

  


**If this role and our mission resonate with you, but you're hesitant because you don't check all the boxes, don't let that hold you back. At DeepL, it's about the value you bring and the growth we can foster together. Go ahead, apply—let's discover your potential together. We can't wait to meet you!**

The sub-team focusing on ESG Data has been active for almost a year. As a member of this team, the goal is to collaboratively build an ESG Data platform with IT Developers to supply the team involved in Sustainable Finance Regulation Modelling with the necessary data to monitor ESG risk.  

  

Given the significance that regulatory authorities attribute to modelling and the underlying data, this role is challenging and impactful. The Sustainable Finance Regulation project is a new and excellent opportunity to become familiar with this development. Tasks related to this project, which involve building the platform, include:  

  

* Inventory of the playing field with all stakeholders and parties involved;
* Collection of all data requirements for the models;
* Gap analysis of the data requirements for the SFR regulation and the data already available on the platform;
* Planning of the delivery of the required data;
* Actual delivery of dataset to the consumers.


  

Once the platform is ready, you will be involved in the data collection process. Your duties will encompass technical aspects such as SQL and Python programming, performing Data Quality analyses, and integrating datasets. Simultaneously, you'll be working on documentation and utilizing your communicative skills for stakeholder alignment. Active participation in frequent team meetings, where knowledge-sharing and progress transparency are key, is also expected. In this role, everything revolves around data modelling, along with related activities:  

  

* Discussing data requirements for different ESG risk models and reports with the modellers and reporting analysts;
* Make an inventory of the relevant databases within the bank and gain access to them;
* Combine tables (merge / link) and aggregate data in SQL and Python;
* Apply Data Quality Analysis, for example, course over time, missing values, extreme values;
* Investigate the plausibility of the new data;
* Document the data sourcing process and descriptive statistics and discuss this with the business parties;
* Additionally, there are many ad hoc activities, and you will regularly participate in cross-departmental projects. Your ability and willingness to collaborate are crucial for success in this role. You naturally take initiative, organize work effectively, and eagerly work with others to deliver tangible results. You possess a practical, analytical approach and strong communication and presentation skills. Being a robust team player, you take responsibility for your work. In the dynamic environment in which you operate, you have the ability to get all stakeholders on board.

 ***We do it right:*** When you’re moving fast it can be tempting to constantly cut corners to things done. But this results in a product that is a struggle to work with and has unhappy users. We make that extra effort to be proud of what we’re building; understand the problem we’re solving, write one more test or tackle technical debt.

 ***We are empowered to act, challenge and lead:*** To work effectively as a team everyone must have a voice and feel they can stand up and be counted. As a software engineer at Returnista we want you to feel empowered. That could mean proposing new ideas, fixing things without seeking permission or challenging the CEO.

 ***We are intrepid:*** We want our engineers to show initiative and to innovate. Intrepid Friday’s give us the opportunity to work on things that might not ostensibly be the highest priority, but can make a big difference to our product or how we work.

As a Data Platform Engineer at MSF, you will be responsible for the Azure-based Central Data Hub (CDH).



MSF is an international, independent medical humanitarian organization. We are a non-profit, self-governed worldwide movement of more than 63,000 people.



We provide emergency medical assistance during armed conflict, natural disasters, outbreaks of deadly diseases and assist those who are excluded from healthcare. MSF delivers care based on need and when we see injustice, we speak out. We are an organization that remains impartial, knowledgeable, and effective, and this is what makes the difference between life and death.



People are our priority. At Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)/Artsen zonder Grenzen, we are committed to an inclusive culture that encourages and supports the diverse voices of our employees. We encourage diverse applicants including individuals of all gender identities, ages, sexual orientations, nationalities, races, religions, beliefs, social and marital status, people with different abilities and all other diversity characteristics and how they work together.

**Data** **Platform** **Engineer** **(100%)**



Based in Amsterdam

  




**Day in the life of a Data** **Platform** **Engineer at MSF**

  




You start your day with the bi-weekly operational update from the OPS department to hear what is going on in our projects, for instance in our Cholera project in Goma or vaccination campaign in South Sudan. Then it’s time to get to your engineering work. You consult with your stakeholders during a short daily stand-up on how to extract the data from one of our HR systems and properly transform it in our Azure SQL DB, ready to be used for analytics.



As you will be at least coding 50% of the time that day, you have plenty of time focusing on the development of this data pipeline in Azure Data Factory and by a Python script calling an API. Related to this is the setup & maintenance of our MSF Azure Central Data Hub infrastructure, fixing bugs, improving code base (optimizing performance for instance). Data evangelism and scrum ceremonies (the stand-ups, retros and alignment with the different stakeholders) will also demand some time that day, but you manage to spark enthusiasm of your achievements so far.



In the late afternoon you have a brainstorming about the plentiful opportunities to automate monitoring and data quality checks for other projects, and to identify a possible implementation of a ML model into production that a data scientist has created. We work on the latest cutting-edge Azure tech-stack.



At the end of the day, as it happens to be Friday, you join the data team for a well-earned drink!

As you will be at least coding 50% of the time that day, you have plenty of time focusing on the development of this data pipeline in Azure Data Factory and by a Python script calling an API. Related to this is the setup & maintenance of our MSF Azure Central Data Hub infrastructure, fixing bugs, improving code base (optimizing performance for instance). Data evangelism and scrum ceremonies (the stand-ups, retros and alignment with the different stakeholders) will also demand some time that day, but you manage to spark enthusiasm of your achievements so far.



In the late afternoon you have a brainstorming about the plentiful opportunities to automate monitoring and data quality checks for other projects, and to identify a possible implementation of a ML model into production that a data scientist has created. We work on the latest cutting-edge Azure tech-stack.



At the end of the day, as it happens to be Friday, you join the data team for a well-earned drink!

We assess and engage with 2,000 companies across seven system transformations: digital, food and agriculture, nature and biodiversity, decarbonisation and energy, finance, social, and urban, and we collaborate with more than 350 Allies worldwide to facilitate the use of our research insights for stakeholder action.

  



In the coming year, we will be working towards the publication of all our corporate benchmarks: climate and energy, food and agriculture, finance, digital inclusion, human rights, gender, social, nature, and urban. We are seeking to scale up and strengthen our research on how companies perform on a range of sustainable development topics and are therefore looking to grow our research team.

You should thrive in a fast-paced and purpose-driven work environment that provides high levels of autonomy.

  


**What you will do:**


* Accurately and objectively assess company performance on sustainable development by applying several WBA benchmark methodologies and scoring guidelines on publicly available information. This could involve undertaking initial data collection from corporate disclosures and public databases and/or reviewing the initial data collected by external research partners.
* Draft company scorecards that provide clear insights into a company’s leading practices as well as risks and opportunities.
* Communicate and engage with benchmarked companies to ensure they understand the relevant methodologies, provide feedback or additional information, share their experiences on how benchmarking influences positive changes at the company level, and participate in peer learning activities and other relevant WBA convenings.
* Participate in the team’s effort towards data cleaning, data management, data analysis, and data visualization.
* Contribute towards the drafting of key findings, research reports and articles.
* Suggest ways to improve methodologies, scoring guidelines, research workflows, and analytical techniques.

* Cooperate with your team to deliver accurate research outputs in a timely manner.
* Continually upskill on research methods and tools while enhancing your understanding of relevant industry trends and policy environments.

  


**What we are looking for:**


* At least three years of professional research experience in relevant fields. For this recruitment round, we are especially interested in candidates who are knowledgeable on the topics of human rights issues, or candidates with training and experience relevant to biodiversity, nature and ocean topics or the financial sector, or the food and agriculture sector.
* Strong academic qualifications and research skills, or equivalent hands-on experience. A relevant research PhD is an advantage and counts towards years of professional experience.
* Strong verbal and written English communication skills; able to write clearly and concisely for professional audiences. Additional language skills are a plus.
* Solid grasp of applied statistics and data analysis as well as familiarity with database querying and spreadsheets. Ability to script in R or Python is a plus.
* Data visualization and graphical design skills are a plus.
* Strong interest in research, especially on corporate performance on sustainable development and the business and policy environments that shape that performance.
* Passion for making a difference with a curious mindset and a ‘can do’, hands-on and professional attitude.
* Potential to thrive in a teal culture based on self-managed teams, able to take initiative, self-reflect and collaborate with colleagues.
* Comfortable in a globally inclusive, multi-cultural, fast-paced, agile, and virtual/hybrid environment that promotes flexibility whilst being able to meet deadlines.

**De afdeling -** ***Directie Grote Ondernemingen***  

De Directie Grote Ondernemingen (GO) is verantwoordelijk voor de fiscale behandeling van de ongeveer 9.000 grootste ondernemingen en non-profit organisaties in Nederland. Daarnaast behandelt GO een aantal dossiers van zeer vermogende personen en voeren we een aantal zeer uiteenlopende specialistische taken uit zoals de kansspelbelasting en constructiebestrijding. Onze klanten vertegenwoordigen zo’n 75% van de belastinginkomsten van de rijksoverheid. Ook genereren zij veel informatie die de overheid gebruikt voor bijvoorbeeld toeslagen of studiefinanciering.


De uitvoerings- en toezichtstrategie van GO is gericht op bereidwillige naleving van wet- en regelgeving door deze organisaties. Zij kenmerken zich door relatief grote financiële belangen en complexere fiscale vraagstukken. In het geval van multinationals komt daar nog een component bij in de vorm van internationale wet- en regelgeving en samenwerking met buitenlandse belastingdiensten.


Om er voor te zorgen dat de belastingafdracht van deze organisaties soepel blijft lopen werkt GO met behandelteams. In deze teams wordt kennis over de specifieke branche, de individuele ondernemingen en kennis van de verschillende belastingmiddelen samengebracht.


Zo werkt GO aan een zo efficiënt en effectief mogelijk proces voor het heffen, controleren en innen van de belastingen bij de grootste ondernemingen en non profit organisaties en zo dragen we bij aan een financieel gezond Nederland.

 **De organisatie**  

Belastingdienst

De Belastingdienst maakt het burgers en bedrijven zo gemakkelijk mogelijk om verplichtingen na te kunnen komen en gebruik te kunnen maken van rechten. Dat gebeurt met passende dienstverlening, door massale processen juist en tijdig uit te voeren én door adequaat toezicht uit te oefenen.

**Sluitingsdatum:** 23 September 2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13280
*Are you passionate about advancing our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying social media's impact on youth?*
*Is it your ambition to be a part of an international team of researchers?**Are you enthusiastic about multi-method approaches that combine computational modeling, experience sampling, social media data donation and questionnaires with intervention-, experimental- and neuroimaging- studies?*  

*We would like to get to know you!*  

*The Connected Minds Lab* *at the department of Developmental Psychology is looking two PhD Candidates who are interested in joining our team.*  


**What are you going to do**  

The PhD canidates will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.
The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and two Postdocs, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).  

**What are you going to do**  


As a part of this team consisting of national and international researchers, and societal partners, you will play a central role in one of the work packages of this project. You will work on a wide array of research tasks, that include designing and performing empirical studies, and co-supervising RA’s working on the project.
Your tasks as a PhD within this ERC Consolidator project will include the following:
* Recruiting teens, students, parents for your studies;
* Draft pre-registrations and submit ethics reviews.
* Conduct data-analysis and prepare results for publications;
* Draft articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals;
* Contribute to the Connected Minds Lab and the wider scientific community through collaborations, workshops, presentations/talks, attending conferences.

  


**What do you have to offer**  


We are looking for a dedicated candidate who is eager to conduct basic/fundamental research on the psychological mechanisms underlying social media engagement and who is excited about making societal contributions. The candidate must thrive in a collaborative environment that calls for autonomy, creativity, and commitment. Given the quantitative focus of the projects an affinity with computational modeling and programming is recommended.  

***Your experience and profile***
* You hold a master’s degree in psychology, pedagogics, sociology, educational science, or an associated field. If you completed your master’s degree in the Netherlands, we have a preference for a research master, although this is not a requirement;
* You have strong interest in quantitative research;
* You are motivated to design and conduct your own quantitative research;
* You have excellent quantitative data-analysis skills or you are interested in acquiring these skills;
* Affinity with Open Science (pre-registrations, sharing data etc.);
* Experience with R or Python
* You have excellent writing and presentation skills in English;
* You enjoy working in a team of ambitious researchers.

  

  

Because the project involves intensive data collection with youth, sometimes at schools, mastering the Dutch language is an advantage. Please note that this is **not** a requirement, because excellent candidates who do not speak Dutch may be able to collect data with the assistance of Dutch-speaking students.  

**What can we offer you**  


* A position in which initiative and input are highly valued;
* An enthusiastic and warm team that is open to new colleagues;
* An inspiring academic and international working environment, in the heart of Amsterdam.

  


The position concerns employment of 38 hours per week for 4 years (or 30,4 hours for approximately 5 years). The initial employment is for one year. Following a positive assessment and barring altered circumstances this term will be extended, which should result in the conferral of a doctorate. Together with you, your supervisors will put together a curriculum that will also include the opportunity to attend training courses and both national and international events. You will also have the opportunity to teach bachelor’s and master’s students.  

Your salary will be €2.770 gross per month in the first year and will increase to €3.539 in the final year, based on full-time employment (38 hours per week) and in keeping with the Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities. We additionally offer an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%  


The UvA offers excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.  


**About us**  

The University of Amsterdam is the largest university in the Netherlands, with the broadest spectrum of degree programmes. It is an intellectual hub with 39,000 students, 6,000 employees and 3,000 doctoral students who are all committed to a culture of inquiring minds.  

***About the faculty***
A challenging work environment with a variety of duties and ample scope for individual initiative and development within an inspiring organization. The social and behavioral sciences play a leading role in addressing the major societal challenges faced by the world, the Netherlands and Amsterdam, now and in the future.

Afhankelijk van het functieniveau kan de pre employment screening uit de volgende onderdelen bestaan: Verklaring Omtrent Gedrag (VOG) of – indien geen VOG in Nederland kan worden aangevraagd – Criminal Background Check uit het land waar je op dit moment woont of de afgelopen vijf jaren hebt gewoond, integriteitsvragenlijst, verificatie van ID, diploma’s en/of werkervaring en het raadplegen van het centraal insolventieregister.",r,https://eyglobal.yello.co/jobs/WfDVx8WsNCVpwVrvE3flLQ?job_board_id=c1riT--B2O-KySgYWsZO1Q,https://www.ey.com,"London, England",,"10,000+",more than $10B (USD),"At EY, we are committed to building a better working world.",https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/2138292378140570afde98e7103dbb54,https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/1960x400/105005f7dfd7b676644e5fcb2321d14c,Carmine Di Sibio,https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_ceophoto/512x512/dd89b7fd0c8bce611d18b9eeed72cd55,fe7653b0297acf69,,nl,,,

This PhD position is about the continuous visual guidance of locomotor behavior in team sports. In this project, you will develop and test ecological models of how athletes (decide to) act upon moving targets. Existing models typically dissociate decision making and motor control. Either focusing on the information that is needed to perceive relevant action possibilities (known as affordances) or focusing on the information that is needed to control behavior (known as control laws).



In a recent modelling study on the kinematics of catching in baseball, we found that the information that guides the control of action might actually be the same information that also informs decision making. This unification of information challenges traditional models of control in perception-action research. With this PhD project, we aim to extend our model to include all interceptive behaviors in sports, such as tackling / evading an opponent or running to receive a pass.



In this position, you will collect kinematic data that allows you to make inferences on the perceptual information that is used to guide interceptive behaviors in sports. Data may be collected using sensor platforms such as XSens Link; OptiTrack; JohanSports GPS tracking; and Tobii eye tracking. You will also work with – and build on – Virtual Reality setups that allow you to investigate interceptive behaviors in a range of sport specific scenarios. You will perform high quality and internationally visible research that gets published at top tier conferences and journals.



### **Your profile**

* You have, or will shortly acquire, a master’s degree in human Movement Sciences; Sport Science; Interaction Technology; Biomedical Engineering or a related degree with a focus on human movement and movement technology.
* You have experience with or interest in Ecological Psychology / Ecological Theory
* You have experience with modelling and simulating movement kinematics.
* You have experience in collecting, processing, and analyzing biomechanical / biodynamical / kinematic data.
* You have good scientific programming skills for example in MATLAB, Python, and R statistics. Experience with Unity is a plus.
* You are proficient in English for communication, both in writing and oral
### **Our offer**

To empower this movement, we publish free and public corporate benchmarks on systemic issues related to sustainable development. We assess and engage with 2,000 companies across seven system transformations: digital, food and agriculture, nature and biodiversity, decarbonisation and energy, finance, social, and urban, and we collaborate with more than 350 Allies worldwide to facilitate the use of our research insights for stakeholder action.

  



In the coming year, we will be working towards the publication of all our corporate benchmarks: climate and energy, food and agriculture, finance, digital inclusion, human rights, gender, social, nature, and urban. We are seeking to scale up and strengthen our research on how companies perform on a range of sustainable development topics and are therefore looking to grow our research team.

  



We have several openings for the role of “Sustainability Research Analyst”. In this role, you will undertake research, from data collection to analysis, to shed light on how companies are contributing to the positive system changes needed to achieve the 17 United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. You will be objectively assessing companies to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement. You should thrive in a fast-paced and purpose-driven work environment that provides high levels of autonomy.

  


**What you will do:**


* Accurately and objectively assess company performance on sustainable development by applying several WBA benchmark methodologies and scoring guidelines on publicly available information. This could involve undertaking initial data collection from corporate disclosures and public databases and/or reviewing the initial data collected by external research partners.
* Draft company scorecards that provide clear insights into a company’s leading practices as well as risks and opportunities.
* Communicate and engage with benchmarked companies to ensure they understand the relevant methodologies, provide feedback or additional information, share their experiences on how benchmarking influences positive changes at the company level, and participate in peer learning activities and other relevant WBA convenings.
* Participate in the team’s effort towards data cleaning, data management, data analysis, and data visualization.
* Contribute towards the drafting of key findings, research reports and articles.
* Suggest ways to improve methodologies, scoring guidelines, research workflows, and analytical techniques.
* When required, undertake additional data collection and analysis to support the development of more nuanced and contextualized insights on corporate performance.
* Cooperate with your team to deliver accurate research outputs in a timely manner.
* Continually upskill on research methods and tools while enhancing your understanding of relevant industry trends and policy environments.

  


**What we are looking for:**


* At least three years of professional research experience in relevant fields. For this recruitment round, we are especially interested in candidates who are knowledgeable on the topics of human rights issues, or candidates with training and experience relevant to biodiversity, nature and ocean topics or the financial sector, or the food and agriculture sector.
* Strong academic qualifications and research skills, or equivalent hands-on experience. A relevant research PhD is an advantage and counts towards years of professional experience.
* Strong verbal and written English communication skills; able to write clearly and concisely for professional audiences. Additional language skills are a plus.
* Solid grasp of applied statistics and data analysis as well as familiarity with database querying and spreadsheets. Ability to script in R or Python is a plus.
* Data visualization and graphical design skills are a plus.
* Strong interest in research, especially on corporate performance on sustainable development and the business and policy environments that shape that performance.
* Passion for making a difference with a curious mindset and a ‘can do’, hands-on and professional attitude.
* Potential to thrive in a teal culture based on self-managed teams, able to take initiative, self-reflect and collaborate with colleagues.
* Comfortable in a globally inclusive, multi-cultural, fast-paced, agile, and virtual/hybrid environment that promotes flexibility whilst being able to meet deadlines.

  


**Our offer:**



We stimulate personal growth and believe in flexible working arrangements, and you will receive market-based employment benefits (the equivalent of the all-in annual compensation range of €44k - €49k gross). We have a physical presence in Amsterdam and London, alongside many employees who work across the world. You can be based anywhere for this role as inclusivity is one of our values.

Dit doen we met team van traders en analisten.

**De functie**
--------------


Bij de gemeente Zwolle erkennen we de waarde en de kracht van data. We zoeken naar een data-analist met een passie voor het vak, die een cruciale rol speelt bij het omzetten van data in bruikbare informatie. De data-analist speelt een belangrijke rol in het transformeren van data naar bruikbare informatie.


Het is aan jou om meerwaarde te halen uit onze grote hoeveelheden data. Je vergelijkt, verrijkt en combineert data zodat nieuwe inzichten ontstaan die ons helpen met de aansturing en bijsturing van onze bedrijfsprocessen. Daarnaast ben je nieuwsgierig in het ontdekken van nog meer meerwaarde die uit de data te halen is. Je borgt deze bevindingen in de data-, gegevens en informatiecyclus. Jij adviseert en stimuleert je collega's in het gebruik van de inzichten en de toepasbaarheid in beheer.


Naast het analyseren en transformeren van data is er ook een belangrijke rol weggelegd voor het verkennen en vertalen van de behoeften naar data gedreven oplossingen. De ideale kandidaat fungeert als een brug tussen de business en de technische mogelijkheden. Je ontwikkelt een goed begrip van de organisatiedoelstellingen en de technische (on)mogelijkheden. Hierbij wordt verwacht dat je als data-analist de klantvragen goed in kaart brengt, verfijnt, aanvragen prioriteert en het implementatieproces bewaakt. Je bent in staat om de klantvraag om zetten in een efficiënt product voor de klant en afdeling. Om dit te realiseren werk je met Power BI.


De functie is ontstaan door een groeiende hoeveelheid data en gegevens. En door de toegenomen waarde en gebruik hiervan ook binnen Bedrijfsvoering & Dienstverlening (BV & DV). Als Data-analist werk je aan opdrachten voor de verschillende afdelingen van BV & DV. Dit doe je niet alleen, maar samen met een collega data-analist. De functie van data-analist in deze setting is vrij nieuw en nog niet in beton gegoten. Dit betekent dat je de ruimte krijgt om te pionieren en samen met je collega data-analist de kans krijgt om je eigen functie vorm te geven. Hier krijg jij energie van en jij ziet het als een mooie uitdaging om data en het gebruik hiervan op de kaart te zetten bij gemeente Zwolle!

**Over Zwolle**
---------------


Ons doel is om meer data gedreven te gaan werken binnen Bedrijfsvoering & Dienstverlening. Vanuit je visie op de meerwaarde van data gedreven werken adviseer je management over oplossingen in bestaande processen en werkzaamheden (tactisch en operationeel). Mede door jouw bijdrage resulteert dit in dat wij onze organisatiedoelstellingen op een slimmere en efficiëntere manier realiseren.


De positionering van deze functie is dichtbij de business, bij de afdelingen waar je voor werkt. Je maakt onderdeel uit van de afdeling Financiën en/of HR.

**Dit doe jij**
---------------

* Je inventariseert de behoefte van de klant en vertaalt dit naar een concrete informatievraag voor de business;
* Je verzamelt en transformeert ruwe data in gestructureerde vormen voor analyse die gemakkelijker te begrijpen en te analyseren zijn;
* Je voert data-onderzoeken uit om inzicht te krijgen in specifieke vraagstukken;
* Je ontwerpt en ontwikkelt data gedreven oplossingen zoals bijvoorbeeld een dashboard om data visueel weer te geven voor verschillende belanghebbenden;
* Je presenteert complexe gegevens op een gebruiksvriendelijke manier. Belanghebbenden kunnen zo makkelijk relevante informatie verkennen;
* Je valideert, ontsluit en verwerkt data. En je checkt met de business of de data en berekeningen juist zijn. zorgt voor consistente, nauwkeurige en betrouwbare data.
* Je past statistische methoden en technieken toe om patronen en trends in de data te identificeren.

**Dit ben jij**
---------------


Je hebt minimaal een hbo-opleiding afgerond en minstens 2 jaar werkervaring als data-analist of Power BI – specialist. Misschien ben je nu al een aantal jaren werkzaam als data-analist bij een (semi) overheidsorganisatie of zorginstelling. Je hebt aantoonbare kennis en ervaring met het ontwikkelen/bouwen van rapportages in Power BI. Het is een pre als je ervaring hebt met DAX (onderdeel van Power BI), Tableau of Qlik.


Je hebt een passie voor data-analyse en een sterk analytisch denkvermogen. Je bent communicatief vaardig en maakt daarmee complexe data inzichtelijk en bruikbaar. En je hebt kennis van verschillende analysetools en methodieken naast Power BI, zoals Tableau of Qlik. Daarnaast ben je proactief, resultaatgericht en gedreven om bij te dragen aan de data gedreven ontwikkeling binnen Bedrijfsvoering & Dienstverlening. Als laatste volg je actief de trends op het gebied van data en datatools en ben je in staat om deze trends actief om te zetten in concrete acties voor Zwolle. Een vereiste is dat je in woord en geschift kan communiceren in het Nederlands op B2 niveau.

**Dit bieden wij**
------------------


Een salaris van maximaal € 5.621- (functieschaal 10A) bruto per maand bij een volledige werkweek van gemiddeld 36 uur per week. Het salaris is afhankelijk van opleiding en ervaring. Daarnaast ontvang je 17,05% van je salaris in de vorm van een individueel keuzebudget (IKB), waarmee je een deel van je arbeidsvoorwaarden naar eigen wens kunt inrichten.


Je hebt de mogelijkheid om dit bedrag maandelijks of jaarlijks te laten uitkeren. Het vakantiegeld en een dertiende maand is in dit bedrag opgenomen. Het pensioen dat voor je wordt opgebouwd, staat los van deze regeling.


Wij investeren in je (persoonlijke) ontwikkeling en horen graag hoe jij dit ziet. In Zwolle werken we hybride. We hebben een budget voor je beschikbaar om je werkplek thuis in te richten. Ook krijg je een laptop en telefoon van de 'zaak'. Je krijgt een jaarcontract met op termijn zicht op een vast contract voor gemiddeld 32-36 uur per week.

---------------


The financial world is changing rapidly. ABN AMRO has a clear strategy to be a personal bank in the digital age and risk management is a key condition for the success of this strategy. Risk Management within the bank is therefore undergoing major changes, with the deployment of the latest technologies revolving around risk intelligence, data management, data analysis and modelling. In a highly regulated environment, you, as a Business Developer in Financial Risk, will be the one to help develop these new technologies, introduce them to the ABN AMRO Risk Management community and ensure that, in the meantime, the day-to-day processes continue to run smoothly. It is a responsible role that you perform in an agile organization, in which you can make maximum use of your stakeholder management and analytical skills and develop them further.  

You want to immerse yourself at least for the coming years into the area of stress testing and scenario analysis and play an important role in the further exploration of this quickly expanding discipline.

**Your job**
------------


As a Business Developer, you uncover and define business requirements from our wide stakeholder group as well as from the various regulations. Together with the stakeholders you develop a vision, integrating those -possibly partially contradicting- requirements, and translate it into concrete implementation plans that are in line with ABN AMRO's longer-term vision.  

You will ensure that these implementation plans are well received by the blocks (teams) that will be implementing them and, where necessary, you will act as an integrator to ensure that the implementation is actually brought live.  

You adapt your vision and implementation plans continuously to the ever-changing environment (both from a regulatory and an internal organisation perspective)

**Working environment**
-----------------------


ABN AMRO works in an agile DevOps environment and you will become part of a multidisciplinary team - which we call a block - of business and IT within the Financial Risk grid.  

The Financial Risk grid is with approximately 250 colleagues responsible for (a.o.) RWA calculations and IFRS9 provisions, including model implementations, stress testing and scenario analysis, Financial Recovery & Resolution and Enterprise Risk reporting. Because the Financial Risk grid is at the heart of the bank's various value chains, your stakeholders are not only within Risk Management departments, but will cover business functions, Finance and other grids.  

You work in co-operation with a small group of experienced colleague business developers.

**Your profile**
----------------


You are a technical Business Analyst or a risk-oriented Data Engineer with the following skill set:

* Thorough understanding of SQL in Oracle or Spark.
* Experience with credit portfolio data (loans, facilities, collateral, clients, risk indicators)
* You have a quantitative acumen, expressed in good understanding of models and data (at least equivalent to a master's degree in a quantitative area).
* Data modelling in relational databases
* Understanding of business processes related to capital requirements (RWA) and IFRS9 calculation
* Strong analytical skills and experience with implementing calculation models
* Affinity for credit risk models, in particular non-IRB models like climate risk and stress testing models
* You have an analytical mindset, always trying to take your expertise to the next level and ready to deep dive into understanding a subject in any of its perspectives. You are able to combine various methodologies and work with changing insights and changing regulatory requirements.
* You are a good communicator and you keep stakeholders involved throughout the process and support them in taking decisions. You have the courage to work with stakeholders to change existing practices when they do not suffice for future requirements.
* You are results-oriented and can keep order in a complex environment. You have experience in taking responsibility for high quality deliverables (for example towards board level or regulator). You have experience in project work, preferably in leading projects.
* You have thorough knowledge of and experience in financial risk management. You are passionate about scenario analysis and stress testing.
**We are offering**
-------------------

* The gross monthly salary displayed above is based on a 36-hour work week, including vacation pay and benefit budget.
* The Benefit Budget is 11% of your salary. The Benefit Budget allows you to acquire additional employment benefits. If you make no purchases or reservations in the Benefit Shop in a given month, you are paid one twelfth of your Benefit Budget that month.
* Five weeks of vacation per year. You have the option to purchase an additional four weeks per year.
* Personal development Budget of € 1,000 per year, which you can accumulate up to € 3,000.
* Possibility to work from home (in consultation with your team and depending on your position).

-------------------


  
De cyberweerbaarheid van de Rijksoverheid vergroten. Dat is de missie van het Security Operations Center (SOC) van SSC-ICT in Den Haag. En daar ga jij als security analist op locatie mee aan de slag. In deze rol zet jij jouw analytische én communicatieve vaardigheden in voor de cyberveiligheid van 7 ministeries. Dit doe je met behulp van de meest geavanceerde tools. En jouw eigen professionele en persoonlijke ontwikkeling? Daar besteden we voortdurend aandacht aan. Zo word jij steeds beter in je vak en onze organisatie steeds slimmer en sneller in het detecteren van cyberdreigingen.


Draag bij aan de cyberveiligheid van 7 ministeries


Je werkt voor het SOC, een onderdeel van de Chief Technology Office (CTO). Als security analist heb je een breed takenpakket. In deze functie ben je verantwoordelijk voor het monitoren van cyberdreigingen en het afhandelen van securitymeldingen van het team en onze partners. Op basis van triage beslis je hoe deze meldingen moeten worden opgevolgd. Ook in de opvolging blijf je als kennispartner betrokken bij een cyberincident. Jij houdt je in het kort bezig met het:

* identificeren van dreigingen, zoals kwetsbaarheden en malware, die vermeld staan in rapportages van externe partijen en in interne rapportages van beheerteams en securitymanagement;
* opvolgen van securitymeldingen en incidenten met behulp van veiliggesteld materiaal zoals logfiles of malware;
* onderzoeken van de oorzaken van securitymeldingen en incidenten om de impactanalyse te kunnen bepalen;
* bijhouden en documenteren van bevindingen in een knowledgebase;
* verbeteren van de detectie op dreiging en daarmee de doorontwikkeling van het SOC.


Jouw precieze werkzaamheden bepalen we aan de hand van jouw ervaringsniveau, competenties en certificering. Dit doen we op een objectieve manier, op basis van een assessment. Waar een medewerker in schaal 11 zich vooral bezighoudt met het afhandelen van vooraf gedefinieerde meldingen, coacht een medewerker in schaal 12 deze collega bij complexere incidenten. Of neemt deze incidenten wanneer nodig over. Een medewerker die wordt ingeschaald in schaal 13 is verantwoordelijk voor de zware dossiers. Ook houden ervaren medewerkers zich bezig met het coördineren van dossiers en het op een heldere manier overbrengen van hun kennis. Je werkt samen in een team met korte lijnen waarin iedereen een eigen expertise meebrengt.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
* Minimaal hbo-werk- en -denkniveau, bij voorkeur heb je een diploma in de richting van ICT of security.
* Minimaal 1 jaar werkervaring met het beveiligen van ICT-systemen en applicaties.
* Enige ervaring met verschillende securitydiensten zoals SIEM-technologie, intrusion detection en kwetsbaarhedenmanagementsystemen.
* Kennis van de normenkaders rondom informatiebeveiliging en van dreigingen en risico’s met betrekking tot computernetwerken en te nemen maatregelen.
* Ervaring met IP-netwerkconcepten, security monitoring, malware, Linux- en Windowssystemen en het herkennen van aanvalstechnieken (technisch en in de vorm van social engineering).

*Competenties:*


Jouw analytische vaardigheden zijn sterk ontwikkeld. Deze zet je samen met je nieuwsgierigheid in om zaken tot op de bodem uit te zoeken. Je toont initiatief en pakt taken zelfstandig op. Kom je er echt niet uit? Dan overleg je met een collega over je vervolgstappen. Je geeft je mening en blijft tegelijkertijd openstaan voor andere manieren van denken en je persoonlijke ontwikkeling. Verder besef je dat je aan zaken met een groot maatschappelijk en politiek afbreukrisico werkt. Hier pas je je gedrag op aan. Op stressvolle momenten bewaar jij je rust en je gaat op een discrete manier met vertrouwelijke informatie om.


  
Arbeidsvoorwaarden
------------------


  
* Salarisniveau schaal 11
* Maandsalaris Min €4.024 – Max. €6.110 (bruto)
* Dienstverband Arbeidsovereenkomst voor bepaalde tijd met uitzicht op onbepaalde tijd
* Contractduur 1 jaar
* Minimaal aantal uren per week 36
* Maximaal aantal uren per week 36

  
Overige arbeidsvoorwaarden
--------------------------


  
Naast het salaris ontvang je een Individueel Keuzebudget (IKB). Het IKB bestaat uit geld (16,50% van je bruto jaarsalaris) en tijd. Met het IKB maak jij de keuzes die bij jou passen en kun je een deel van je arbeidsvoorwaarden zelf samenstellen. Je kunt er bijvoorbeeld voor kiezen om een deel van je maandinkomen te laten uitbetalen wanneer jij dat wenst. Ook kun je dit budget omzetten in verlof en andersom of besteden aan fiscaal vriendelijke doelen. De Rijksoverheid hecht sterk aan persoonlijke groei en loopbaanontwikkeling en biedt daarvoor tal van mogelijkheden. Tot de secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden behoren onder meer verschillende studiefaciliteiten, bedrijfsfitness, volledige vergoeding van je OV-reiskosten woon-werkverkeer en gedeeltelijk betaald ouderschapsverlof.
  
Bijzonderheden
--------------


  
* De einddatum van de vacature is niet leidend. De selectie start wanneer geschikte kandidaten solliciteren. De vacature kan dus vóór de vermelde einddatum sluiten. Wees er daarom op tijd bij en reageer snel!
* De kennismaking en selectieprocedure bestaat uit 2 gesprekken en een assessment.
* Bij een positief verloop volgt een afrondend arbeidsvoorwaardengesprek.
* Een AIVD B-veiligheidsonderzoek is onderdeel van de procedure.
* Werk je, op afgesproken momenten, buiten de operatie aan de doorontwikkeling van het SOC? Dan is hybride werken wel bespreekbaar.
* Goed om te weten: in alle lagen van ons SOC hebben we een bereikbaarheidsdienst. Dit betekent dat iedereen af en toe een piketdienst draait. Bij een groter incident wordt de inzet van het hele team opgeschaald. Uiteraard blijft het bij incidentele gevallen en onze ervaring is dat onze professionals erbij willen zijn, als de nood zich aandient.

Kun jij een visie ontwikkelen op eenduidig werken en deze uitdragen naar andere analisten? Het Team Thematische Intelligence zoekt lead analisten die zich in dit profiel herkennen.


**Specificaties vacature**
--------------------------


### **Locatie(s):**


Den Haag
### **Organisatieonderdeel:**


Eenheid Den Haag
### **Vakgebied(en):**


Analyse & Onderzoek, Intelligence
### **Niveau:**


HBO BACHELOR
**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Als lead analist word je ingezet voor complexe zaaksanalyses. De hoeveelheid data uit meerdere en verschillende bronnen en de maatschappelijke impact maken een onderzoek complex. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan Team Grootschalige Opsporing (TGO) onderzoeken, schietpartijen met gewonden, corruptie, ontvoeringen, gijzelingen, een reeks van overvallen, woninginbraken, terrorisme of zedenzaken. Aan de hand van beschikbare en aangeleverde informatie zorg je voor overzicht en inzicht en geeft hierover advies. Een analyse product bevat altijd een schriftelijk of mondeling advies. Jij bent als meewerkend voorman/vrouw degene die de binnen rechercheonderzoeken de behoefte uit de praktijk snel leert kennen en de analyses gevraagd, maar ook zeker ongevraagd maakt. Je vertaalt op efficiënte manier grote hoeveelheden informatie vanuit verschillende bronnen naar praktisch toepasbare analyse-/intelligence producten. Je kiest welke methoden en technieken het beste voldoen om resultaat te bereiken (telecomanalyse, netwerkanalyse, geo-analyse). Ook werk je bijvoorbeeld hypotheses en scenario’s uit en zorg je voor kritisch en onafhankelijk advies in een onderzoek, om tunnelvisie te voorkomen. Hiermee heb je met jouw analyse en onderzoeks-skills impact op de veiligheid in Nederland.


Naast de zaken die je zelf draait is een belangrijk onderdeel van de functie het coachen en begeleiden van andere analisten en medewerkers, zowel thematisch als generiek. Jij zorgt ervoor dat operationeel en tactisch analisten op een eenduidige werkwijze aan de slag gaan. Ook zorg je voor een stukje bewustwording bij collega’s en help je mee om bij aanvang van een onderzoek na te denken over een passende datastrategie. Zodra je mogelijkheden ter verbetering ziet doe je hier een voorstel voor. Je bent goed op de hoogte van effectieve interventies, (on-)mogelijkheden in de aanpak en hebt een adviseursrol in de toepassingsmogelijkheden van de analyse. Je neemt deel aan netwerken, deelt je kennis met je collega’s en brengt zodoende ook de kwaliteit van de afdeling naar een hoger niveau.


Vanzelfsprekend volg je maatschappelijke en vaktechnische ontwikkelingen op de voet en je weet deze te vertalen naar de politiepraktijk. Je adviseert de teamchef thematisch werken over de kwaliteit van de operationele en tactische analyseproducten. Je werkt samen met de andere lead analisten binnen thematische intelligence aan de kwaliteit van het analyseproces. Hierbij maak je gebruik van de kennis en expertise die je hebt opgebouwd op analysegebied. Samen met je collega’s binnen de verschillende organisatieonderdelen bedenk je oplossingen voor veiligheids- en datavraagstukken uit de politiepraktijk en werk je met de data die daaruit voortkomt.


Tot slot kunnen piketdiensten onderdeel uitmaken van de functie.


**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


Je komt binnen de Eenheid Den Haag te werken bij het Team Thematische Intelligence. Hier werken intelligencespecialisten en analisten gezamenlijk aan specifieke thema’s. De afdeling is onderdeel van de Dienst Regionale Intelligence Organisatie (DRIO) en werkt nauw samen met verschillende DRIO-onderdelen en andere afdelingen binnen én buiten de organisatie. Onze specialisten worden ingezet op diverse taakgebieden binnen de organisatie, waaronder verschillende afdelingen van de recherche en andere intelligence afdelingen. Er wordt gewerkt op diverse intelligencethema’s in zogeheten intelcellen. Binnen een intelcel werken collega’s van verschillende afdelingen samen aan één veiligheidsthema zoals mensenhandel, cybercriminaliteit, ondermijning, jeugdcriminaliteit of openbare orde, terrorisme, extremisme en radicalisering. Zaaksanalisten worden veelal ingezet voor onderzoeken naar drugs en excessief geweld.


Als afdeling geven we inzicht in en duiden we de context van veiligheidsvraagstukken. We analyseren de samenhang tussen verschillende aspecten van veiligheidsproblemen ter ondersteuning van de besluitvorming op elk niveau. We ontwikkelen en beheren standaarden ten behoeve van informatieproducten en analyseoplossingen maar ontwikkelen ook maatwerkoplossingen voor incidentele en complexe informatievragen. Over het hele proces bewaken wij daarbij de kwaliteit van vastgelegde informatie door controle en advisering.


**Wie ben jij?**
----------------


De kernwaarden van ons team zijn: vindingrijk, ambitieus, betrokken en betrouwbaar en deze zijn ook jou op het lijf geschreven. Daarnaast ben je vanzelfsprekend analytisch ijzersterk en kun je methodologisch verantwoord informatie uit verschillende bronnen met elkaar in verband brengen. Je hebt (ruime) ervaring in het werkveld van (zaaks)analyse en het toepassen van zowel kwantitatieve als kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethoden. Dankzij jouw vermogen om te luisteren en de juiste vragen te stellen sta je in goed contact met je collega analisten en kom je gezamenlijk tot een optimale afstemming van het gewenste effect met het analyseproduct. Ook onder tijdsdruk kun je inzicht genereren en ben je in staat de (on-)mogelijkheden binnen een analyseopdracht af te wegen om alsnog te komen tot het optimale resultaat.


Als eindverantwoordelijke voor het analyseproces ben je dan ook organisatiesensitief en heb je oog voor de verschillende belangen binnen een politiek-bestuurlijke context. Je bent in staat om helder te adviseren (zowel schriftelijk als mondeling) en voelt je comfortabel in een complexe snel veranderende omgeving. Je weet zelfstandig je weg te vinden in organisaties en kunt goed omgaan met bureaucratische processen. Je bent benaderbaar voor andere analisten en vindt het leuk hen te coachen en/of te begeleiden in het werk. Verder neem je makkelijk initiatief, ben je zowel een teamplayer als een zelfstandige werker en ben je gericht op samenwerking en open-minded. Je bent goed op de hoogte van wat er speelt in de maatschappij en hebt een brede blik die zowel in- als extern is gericht.


Verder beschik je over:


* hbo werk- en denkniveau\* en bij voorkeur een relevante opleiding waarin methoden van onderzoek en/of (data)analyse nadrukkelijk en aantoonbaar een plek hebben gehad;
* ervaring met coaching en begeleiding van medewerkers;
* ervaring met het verwerken en analyseren van grote hoeveelheden (ongestructureerde) data en ervaring met data-analysesystemen;
* ervaring met diverse systemen (waaronder iBase, Analyst’s Notebook, Mercure, Mindmanager) en het gebruik van Summ-IT als bronsysteem;
* ervaring met het professioneel presenteren van bevindingen;
* affiniteit met het intelligence- en opsporingsvakgebied en affiniteit met digitalisering;
* een rijbewijs B.

Zo kunnen ze beleid maken dat toekomstbestendig is.”* Bij het Radboudumc bouw je aan de toekomst. We gaan voor de beste zorg, onderwijs en onderzoek.

En heb jij ideeën over datagedreven werken? Dan wacht je niet af en deel je die met je collega’s. We zijn een organisatie in ontwikkeling. Daarom is lerend vermogen en een flexibele houding noodzakelijk.

– Je gebruikt je expertise op het gebied van SIEM, network security en threat analytics om onze playbooks in Microsoft Sentinel te verfijnen. Je denkt ook actief mee aan het uitbouwen van onze Managed Detection & Response dienstverlening.  

– Je beoordeelt opkomende technologieën, trends, kwetsbaarheden en bedreigingen. Samen met het team spar je over de kansen en risico’s. Met deze nieuwe inzichten maak je het verschil voor onze klanten (en de organisatie natuurlijk!).

Developing Digital Twin Capabilities for the Dutch Electricity Transmission System.


Job description


TenneTwin project in collaboration with TenneT TSO in The Netherlands aims to develop the digital twin foundation for the Dutch electricity transmission system by applying digitalization, unlocking an unprecedented level of transparency. This enables optimal operation, maintenance, upgrading, and expansion of the power grid to match with the government and TenneT Target Grid 2045 ambitions.



Within the TenneTwin project, TU Delft is hiring two doctoral candidates on the subject: ""Developing Digital Twin Capabilities for the Dutch Electricity Transmission System"". You will develop a digital twin of the Dutch power grid to better utilise the electricity transmission system, ensure system stability and resilience, and help transmission system operators and policymakers make informed decisions. The research questions answered in TenneTwin project are (1) how to model the TenneT power system to suit the needs of the digital twin, (2) how to determine the sufficient modelling details and verify the model accuracy, (3) how to tune the model parameters to continuously match them with present reality, and (4) how to detect the actual power grid state in sufficient details and update the digital twin model to run simulations and advanced grid analytics?



Tackling these scientific questions requires a multi-disciplinary approach combining knowledge in electrical power systems and information and communication technologies, and excellent software coding skills.



PhD-1 focuses on modelling, version control, and simulation. This includes:



* Investigate modelling, simulation, and related data needs of the digital twin


* Model and simulate various (cross-domain) systems that are part of the digital twin in an effective and comprehensive way, preferably using one solver engine for all


* Develop mechanisms for the model initialisation, e.g., combined power system, communication, and market models, in different operating conditions



PhD-2 focuses on data sources, model adaptiveness and parameter tuning. This includes:



* Investigate the systems’ data needs to suit the purpose of the digital twin for continuous mirroring


* Develop mechanisms to detect and mirror actual systems’ conditions to their digital model counterparts


* Develop mechanisms to fine-tune the digital model parameters based on actual systems' data


* Explore cross-domain sub-system interactions and interdependencies through sensitivity analysis using simulations



We offer four-year PhD appointments, with an anticipated start date in November 2024.



You will be a member of the section Intelligent Electrical Power Grids, in Electrical Sustainable Energy (ESE) Department, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science at TU Delft.

Ben je een ondernemend persoon, continu opzoek naar kansen en wil je je techniekkennis verdiepen? Lees dan snel door!

Stel je voor: een belangrijke brug op een drukke snelweg geeft een storing. Tijdens de ochtendspits. Als maintenance engineer gaan jouw radertjes draaien. Hoe had dit voorkomen kunnen worden? Welke signalen zijn gemist? Jij hebt in jouw werk namelijk inzichtelijk hoe de bedrijfsmiddelen, oftewel de assets, van jouw opdrachtgever ervoor staan. Je houdt je dagelijks bezig met asset- en reliability management. Op basis van analyses maak je een goede afweging tussen prestaties, risico’s en kosten en doe je verbetervoorstellen.

**Wat ga je doen als Junior Maintenance Engineer?**

Als Junior Maintenance Engineer heb je bovenal één belangrijke missie: leren, ervaren en beter worden! Net als onze andere collega’s ga je vier van de vijf werkdagen als consultant aan de slag bij onze opdrachtgevers in de productie-industrie of infrasector. Je bent verantwoordelijk voor het optimaliseren van onderhoudstrategieën voor de bedrijfsmiddelen (assets). Je stelt onderhoudsconcepten op en vertaalt deze naar onderhoudsplannen en begrotingen. Uit analyses van onderhoud -en storingsinformatie adviseer jij verbetervoorstellen.

Als junior weet je natuurlijk nog niet alles, maar maak je juist gebruik van de skill-set die je wel al hebt. Wij helpen je met de vakinhoudelijke kennis die je nodig hebt om de taken goed uit te voeren. Je wordt begeleid door een ervaren collega waarmee je wekelijks spart over je ervaringen en uitdagingen die je tegenkomt. Daarmee heb je ook een sponsor die je helpt je eigen ambitie zo snel mogelijk te verwezenlijken.

Naast het werken bij de klant, werk je één dag per week aan de bedrijfsontwikkeling van Veerenstael.

About the position: Mechanical recycling of plastics, is the most efficient way to treat the plastic waste in a sustainable way. However, the quality of recyclates is usually compromised leading to products with inferior properties. Quality of reprocessed samples (recyclates) depend on many factors but also is application dependent. An effective recycling process benefits from products with low variability in properties such as rheological and mechanical characteristics. To achieve this, several tests are required and a sorting and re-cycling line needs to be optimized to predict the quality of the output. The predictions should be carried out in a scientifically and economically viable method to assure applicability in industry.  

This project applies the state-of-the art machine learning models combined with plethora of experiments to generate data for training the model. The significance of this project is governed by the dependency of the plastic industry on the recyclates with consistent and high quality. The quality estimation is a topic which our quality model can address. How-ever, predictions require a step backward and to impute the data gaps to assure inline sorting and separation is feasible with high accuracy and high rates.  

The result of this project, can support the end users of the recyclates as well as the producers of the regrinds to position their products in the right market.  

This PhD topic is meant to go deep into the polymer science and machine learning and therefore is highly interdisciplinary. Thus, the candidates with background in polymer science and engineering and machine learning are encouraged to apply. This position provides the candidate with necessary experience to flourish in the upcoming fields of circularity with a flavor of data science, engineering and polymer science.

  


**Requirements**


* A polymer-oriented materials scientist/engineer with a background in data science. You should have distinct track record in at least one of these polymer groups: packaging polymers like polyolefins and/or PET, technical polymers like ABS, PC and (HI)PS. A background in textiles engineering or rubbers does not meet these requirements.
* Experience with polymer processing machinery such as injection moulding and extrusion.
* Experience with polymer characterization methods such as tensile, impact, rheology, IR, Raman, HDT are required.
* Fluency in python or equivalent is bare minimum. Therefore, the candidates which aspire to learn the basic language models within the PhD are not encouraged to apply.

  




This position is available from January 1st 2025 for a planned duration of 48 months. You work in an international interdisciplinary team with cutting-edge equipment in melt-processing machinery, rheological characterization, and polymer analytics.

Wil jij richting geven aan de AI-toepassingen die Zilveren Kruis gaan helpen om gezondheid dichterbij te brengen voor iedereen? En heb je daarbij een visie op het bijbehorende datalandschap om dit te realiseren? Dan is de functie van Chapter Lead – Data Engineering & Science wat voor jou! Data en de toepassing van AI spelen een steeds grote rol in het creëren van een 9+ klantbeleving voor onze verzekerden, nieuwe businessmodellen en het automatiseren van de interne operationele processen. Het is daarom essentieel dat we als Zilveren Kruis steeds meer waarde d.m.v. data en AI gaan creëren. Binnen Zilveren Kruis zoeken we daarom een Chapter Lead – Data Engineering & Science die d.m.v. het 360 Graden Klantbeeld en de toepassing van AI het Customer Center of Data (CCoD) kan inspireren en ontwikkelen om richting te geven aan deze waardecreatie via data.  

  

In de functie van Chapter Lead – Data Engineering & Science ben je verantwoordelijk voor de visie op AI (vanuit data) en zorg je voor de vertaling van deze visie naar waarde leverende AI-toepassingen om de ambitie om een 9+ klantbeleving te bieden aan de klanten van Zilveren Kruis en reguliere bedrijfsprocessen efficiënter te maken. Daarnaast ben je verantwoordelijk voor het (door)ontwikkelen en beheren van het datalandschap van Zilveren Kruis met als doel om de waardecreatie vanuit data (via bijv. analyses) zo goed mogelijk te ondersteunen. Hierbij heb je een visie op het breder uitdragen van het datalandschap binnen de organisatie en het enthousiasmeren van stakeholders op het toepassen van AI binnen hun werkzaamheden.  

  

Als Chapter Lead ben je leidinggevende van 12 data engineers en data scientists. Een groot deel van je tijd ben je bezig om te sturen op de ontwikkeling van deze professionals op hun persoonlijke en vakinhoudelijke vaardigheden. Tevens vervul je een brugfunctie naar het andere chapter binnen het CCoD, namelijk Data Consultancy & Science. Heb jij data ontsloten in het 360 Graden Klantbeeld waarmee je kansen ziet voor een dashboard? Zie je kansen voor de implementatie van een voorspelmodel t.b.v. de stakeholders van de data consultants? In afstemming met de collega’s en Chapter Lead van Data Consultancy & Onderzoek zorg je dat deze zaken worden geïmplementeerd.  

  

**Hoe ziet je dag eruit?**  

In de ochtend ben je aanwezig in de verschillende weekstarts van de data engineers en data scientists en hoort daar of er nog problemen zijn in de lopende of nieuw op te starten werkzaamheden. O.b.v. van deze weekstarts stuur je bij op werkzaamheden waar nodig en heb je hierover afstemming met je stakeholders. In de middag sta je stil in het overkoepelde Achmea-overleg hoe het staat met de migratie van ons datalandschap naar de cloud (Azure). Je geeft hierbij aan waar extra effort nodig is om doelen te behalen. Einde dag heb je afstemming met senior management van Klantcontact om een toelichting te geven op een nieuwe AI-toepassing om processen in het Klantcontact center te automatiseren.**De afdeling**

Op de afdeling behoort Agile Kanban tot de dagelijkse manier van werken. Aandachtsgebieden van de afdeling zijn het ontwikkelen van het 360 graden klantbeeld, het automatiseren of verbeteren van operationele processen door middel van AI en het doen van analyses (m.b.v. AI) op strategie, kanalen, customer journeys en propositieontwikkeling (diensten, services), pricing en marktonderzoek.

Jij stapt actief op de business en IT af, voert dialogen en onderzoekt op basis daarvan of er kansen liggen om waarde te creëren met data. Je bent iemand die snel kan schakelen en een stap extra zet om de doelen van het CCoD te bereiken.

#### **Over Stater**


**Wie zijn wij?**
=================


Wie is Stater eigenlijk? Wellicht heb je nog nooit van ons gehoord, dus wij leggen je graag uit wat we doen. Binnen stater ontwikkelen en leveren wij hypothecaire diensten en platformen voor externe geldgevers. Met onze producten en diensten beheren wij 40% van de hypotheken in Nederland. Werken bij ons is dus werken bij een organisatie die midden in de maatschappij staat met producten die veel Nederlandse gezinnen (in) raken. Onze klanten zijn o.a. grote Nederlandse banken en andere geldverstrekkers.


#### **Over deze functie**


**Wat ga je doen?**
===================


Stater is de grootste hypothecaire dienstverlener van Nederland. Stater verleent als Business-2-Business organisatie maatwerk services (BPO, SaaS, Platforms) aan verschillende hypotheekverstrekkers/ banken en we groeien. Dit doen we met circa 1.200 ambitieuze professionals vanuit ons kantoor in Amersfoort Vathorst, op 5 minuten lopen vanaf het station. Ook zijn we actief in België en Duitsland.


Jij maakt deel uit van het Datalab, een relatief jonge afdeling binnen New Business & Innovation gevormd door energieke data scientists. Met passie voor data en model/ product ontwikkeling helpen zij onze klanten en Stater vooruit. We bouwen producten, tools en modellen op basis van predictive modeling, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, LLM’s en nog meer!

  

“Research, Experiments and Creation”, als we uit de data-analyse en inzichten zien dat we iets moois in handen hebben, krijgen we de handen op elkaar en gaan we bouwen aan een product. Kennisintensief én ontzettend leuk. We leren van elkaar en vinden snel de weg naar het live zetten en implementeren van het product. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan een prepayment forecasting model, Document Data extraction, Chatbots, LLM’s, en Summary tools. We zijn in contact met (grote) klanten en gaan vaak samen met de klant verder het proces in; co-creatie. Ook werken we nauw samen met andere afdelingen binnen Stater, de business consultants en relatiemanagers, IT, Tech, architecten, developers maar ook legal, risk, compliancy en BI-beheer teams.

  

#### **Skills**


**Naar wie zijn wij op zoek?**
==============================

Je hebt een bewezen aanpak met on-prem implementeren van nieuwe AI producten en diensten, zowel intern als voor klanten, waarbij je de nodige kennis van systemen en oplossingen in praktijk brengt.

  

Je hebt in elk geval in huis: kennis van Kubernetes, python en verschillende AI toepassingen en implementatie trajecten. Een pré als je kennis hebt van LLM’s, AI modelleren en kennis van deze producten binnen financiële instellingen.

However, the mechanism of action (MOA) of these components is poorly understood. As a PhD in this project, you will decipher the MOA of mEV-mediated metabolic modulation of immune, liver and neuronal cells, analyse mEV composition during lactation, and investigate the impact of milk processing on mEVs.


The positions are supported by the public-private Health Holland TKI-LSH SIGNALERS Project, aiming to unlock the MOA of human mEVs.


**Your job**
------------


In this project, you will develop human cellular in vitro functional readout assays to analyse the metabolic modulatory activity of mEVs (e.g. by metabolic tracing studies (fluxomics)). You will connect these findings to the mEV cargo analysed by multi-omics approaches (i.e., metabolomics, proteomics and lipidomics), and you will intervene in mEV cargo and intracellular pathways to link mEV-cargo to function.


You will benefit from a close collaboration with the University Medical Center Utrecht and Nestlé Research. You will collaborate with Professor Leusen (Center for Translational Immunology, UMC Utrecht) for milk sample collection, with Dr de Theije (Department for Developmental Origins of Disease, UMC Utrecht) for neuronal cell modulation, and with researchers of Nestlé Research for proteomics analysis, data integration and mEV analysis metrics development.


Throughout the project, you will develop core skills in fundamental cell biology and metabolism research, in mass spectrometry and integrated multi-omics analysis, and gain insights in the role of mEVs in the development and intricate relationship of the liver-immune-brain axis. You will execute parts of the project at the partner institutes.


As a team, we prioritise effective collaboration, ongoing feedback, and both professional and personal development. At Utrecht University there are plenty of opportunities to facilitate your development.


**Your qualities**
------------------


You enjoy new scientific concepts and working in an international multidisciplinary team in both academia and industry. You have affinity with fundamental cell biology, metabolism and mass spectrometry and/or multi-omics analysis. And you like learning technical mass spectrometry skills and computational skills needed for the integration of in vitro cellular read-outs and multi-omics analysis. You see it as an interesting challenge to present research at (international) conferences and to stakeholders, and to supervise and educate (master)students on related projects.


Furthermore, you have:


* an MSc degree in Biology, Biomedical sciences, Biochemistry, (Veterinary) Medicine or in a related field and have a good grounding in cell biology and/or metabolism, the immune system, the nervous system or liver biology;
* proficiency in English speaking and writing;
* experience working with in vitro cell cultures (especially with immune, neuronal, and/or liver cell cultures), and/or (multi-)omics analysis would be an asset.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a job for for one year, with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period;
* a working week of 36 to 40 hours and a gross monthly salary between €2,770 and €3,539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth.

Empirically, we have a strong focus on water, climate change and biodiversity.


The department of Environmental Geography (EG) conducts interdisciplinary research on the spatial aspects of environmental and social challenges and the solutions sustainable land use can provide to these.


The department of Environmental Economics (EE) leads the institute’s efforts in improving insights into the interaction between the environment and the economy. The department is one of the main groups of environmental economists in Europe, consisting of around 35 scientific staff and PhD researchers. The department strategy is to consolidate and further strengthen its position as a major player in the European field of environmental economics. Important fields of application include climate change, energy, circular economy, water, ecosystem services, and environmental and natural resource management. The philosophy of the EE department is to closely integrate its research projects with its teaching programme and to initiate and conduct research jointly with stakeholders and collaborating institutes.

We are embarking on Project NAFAS, a landmark 30 million EUR initiative set to revolutionize the field.

  

We are seeking an innovative and skilled scientist with at least 1-3 years of experience and a specific combination of skills: The ideal candidate has profound knowledge of probabilistic machine learning modelling and of the application of these methods in the realm of (adaptive) human-computer interaction.

  

This particular position will focus on the design and development of neuroadaptive systems, i.e., systems that can adapt to the user's cognitive and emotional states in real time, based on a number of simultaneously obtained streams of data. The data in question will include decoded brain activity, discrete event markers of incidents within the environment, and many other continuous or discrete data points providing additional contextual information stemming from a virtual or real-life setting. The successful applicant must have prior experience with handling various time-series data, and will focus, among other things, on: the efficient and effective co-registration of the data and developing a probabilistic modelling framework; the conceptualization, design, and implementation of a comprehensive general framework to automatically find patterns and regularities in this data; and the deployment of that same framework to enable existing HCI implementations to detect and respond to such regularities, making them neuroadaptive. The end goal of this development is to provide the functionality necessary to meaningfully enhance user experience across various applications based on decoded brain activity, even when the exact interaction is not known or intentionally left open at design time. Therefore, a large weight is placed on creativity and ability to find new data-driven and/or machine learning modelling frameworks as well as designing, implementing, and validating proof-of-concept applications.

  

The successful candidate will apply their expert knowledge of probabilistic machine learning modelling and interactive systems to, among other things,

  

* develop mathematical and probabilistic models of human-computer interactions and user behaviours,
* develop methods to perform automatic inference,
* design and develop experiments, prototypes, and proof-of-concept applications to evaluate, validate, and refine the developed methods,
* write computer code, design experiments, and coordinate the necessary data acquisition,
* conduct extensive research into existing HCI and adaptive systems,
* collaborate with experts in different fields, including neuroscience, computer science, and machine learning to bring this technology closer to the market,
* identify key use cases of emerging neuroadaptive capabilities,
* stay abreast of the latest developments in HCI, neuroadaptive technology, and related fields.

* Advanced degree in related field.
* Strong modelling, analytical, programming, and system design skills.
* Proven postgraduate experience in the field of computational modelling, mathematical modelling, or similar.
* Demonstrable experience in the mathematical modelling and analysis of human-computer interaction and adaptation.
* Ability to work collaboratively in a multidisciplinary team and a fast-paced environment.
* Strong communication and presentation skills.

About the position: Mechanical recycling of plastics, is the most efficient way to treat the plastic waste in a sustainable way. However, the quality of recyclates is usually compromised leading to products with inferior properties. Quality of reprocessed samples (recyclates) depend on many factors but also is application dependent. An effective recycling process benefits from products with low variability in properties such as rheological and mechanical characteristics. To achieve this, several tests are required and a sorting and re-cycling line needs to be optimized to predict the quality of the output. The predictions should be carried out in a scientifically and economically viable method to assure applicability in industry.  

This project applies the state-of-the art machine learning models combined with plethora of experiments to generate data for training the model. The significance of this project is governed by the dependency of the plastic industry on the recyclates with consistent and high quality. The quality estimation is a topic which our quality model can address. How-ever, predictions require a step backward and to impute the data gaps to assure inline sorting and separation is feasible with high accuracy and high rates.  

The result of this project, can support the end users of the recyclates as well as the producers of the regrinds to position their products in the right market.  

This PhD topic is meant to go deep into the polymer science and machine learning and therefore is highly interdisciplinary. Thus, the candidates with background in polymer science and engineering and machine learning are encouraged to apply. This position provides the candidate with necessary experience to flourish in the upcoming fields of circularity with a flavor of data science, engineering and polymer science.

  


**Requirements**


* A polymer-oriented materials scientist/engineer with a background in data science. You should have distinct track record in at least one of these polymer groups: packaging polymers like polyolefins and/or PET, technical polymers like ABS, PC and (HI)PS. A background in textiles engineering or rubbers does not meet these requirements.
* Experience with polymer processing machinery such as injection moulding and extrusion.
* Experience with polymer characterization methods such as tensile, impact, rheology, IR, Raman, HDT are required.
* Fluency in python or equivalent is bare minimum. Therefore, the candidates which aspire to learn the basic language models within the PhD are not encouraged to apply.

  




This position is available from January 1st 2025 for a planned duration of 48 months. You work in an international interdisciplinary team with cutting-edge equipment in melt-processing machinery, rheological characterization, and polymer analytics.

Schuberg Philis continues to expand its focus on data for a growing number of customers which means that we are looking for Data Engineers.



We keep our customers moving forward by designing, building and running their data landscapes. These landscapes are often developed in public cloud environments, but there is diversity in implementation: not all customers are the same. We have data lake environments on our own hybrid cloud (sbp.cloud), AWS, Azure and more.


**As an AWS Data Engineer you will:**


* Develop and maintain data pipelines
* Configure and manage tools like Spark, Glue, Kinesis, S3, Lambda, Kafka, Redshift, Athena, EventHub, etc.
* Support tooling such as Gitlab (CI/CD), Terraform (Infra)
* Focus on the technical implementation of use cases and required tools on a new data platform
* Be involved in the data standards and initiatives that we have set for our customers


On a team level, you will be involved in the data strategy of the customer by developing a data platform that will be used to develop various use cases for the users of data. You get to actively explore, design, build and run data lakes in AWS. Your work will be completely customer-focused but you will also contribute to expanding and maturing the Schuberg Philis data landscape architecture and all of its initiatives.


**Who are we looking for?**



In this role, you will thrive if you have the following experience:


* Building data pipelines in a cloud-native manner (e.g. S3, Lambda's, Glue, etc )
* Used to working with large data sets in both data lakes (S3) & data warehouses (Redshift)
* Good AWS knowledge, especially all the data related services
* Python & data library ecosystem
* Spark + Spark Streaming (Java/Scala or PySpark)


Nice to have:


* Software development, particularly API's (Python)
* Kafka & Kafka Connect
* Terraform
* Docker
* Proficiency in Dutch
* AWS Data Analytics Certifications


If you are a strong team player who recognizes yourself in the above, likes to take ownership, can work independently as part of a team, and can challenge us on our decisions: we'd like to hear from you.

 *Everyone we work with and consider working with has a right to equal treatment. The hiring and appraisal process at Schuberg Philis is designed to be thorough and equitable, implementing fair payment, benefits, and opportunities across all demographics.*  

  

*It is our desire to be a company that brings together multiple nationalities, cultures, religions, genders, abilities, and talents within and across our teams.

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)
* Python en SQL

**Fijne pre's:**

* Kennis van jaarrekeningcontrole

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.

  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.  

  

Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?  

  

Naast een afgeronde Bachelor of Master en enkele jaren werkervaring zijn dit de specifieke skills die we zoeken:


* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met Python en PySpark.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met een Spark-omgeving als Azure Data Factory en/of Synapse.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met SQL DB en T-SQL.

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

In this project we investigate both the structural differences between human-made and AI-generated output as well as people’s differential behavioural and physiological responses to them. Concretely, we will study: (1) the spatiotemporal patterns of human-made and AI-generated images/artworks, texts and conversations; (2) people’s behavioural and physiological responses when viewing and reading human-made and AI-generated images/artworks and texts, respectively; (3) the extent and effects of synchronisation when people engage in conversations with chatbots. The goal is to develop a Radical Embodied Turing Test (RETT), on which next-generation AI-detection tools can be based and which can also help to enhance user experience with AI.



The tasks of the PhD candidate are


* Conduct research that results in a dissertation and is in line with the objectives and requirements of the project.

You should thrive in a fast-paced and purpose-driven work environment that provides high levels of autonomy.

This could involve undertaking initial data collection from corporate disclosures and public databases and/or reviewing the initial data collected by external research partners.
* Draft company scorecards that provide clear insights into a company’s leading practices as well as risks and opportunities.
* Communicate and engage with benchmarked companies to ensure they understand the relevant methodologies, provide feedback or additional information, share their experiences on how benchmarking influences positive changes at the company level, and participate in peer learning activities and other relevant WBA convenings.
* Participate in the team’s effort towards data cleaning, data management, data analysis, and data visualization.
* Contribute towards the drafting of key findings, research reports and articles.
* Suggest ways to improve methodologies, scoring guidelines, research workflows, and analytical techniques.

* Cooperate with your team to deliver accurate research outputs in a timely manner.
* Continually upskill on research methods and tools while enhancing your understanding of relevant industry trends and policy environments.

  


**What we are looking for:**


* At least three years of professional research experience in relevant fields. For this recruitment round, we are especially interested in candidates who are knowledgeable on the topics of human rights issues, or candidates with training and experience relevant to biodiversity, nature and ocean topics or the financial sector, or the food and agriculture sector.
* Strong academic qualifications and research skills, or equivalent hands-on experience. A relevant research PhD is an advantage and counts towards years of professional experience.
* Strong verbal and written English communication skills; able to write clearly and concisely for professional audiences. Additional language skills are a plus.
* Solid grasp of applied statistics and data analysis as well as familiarity with database querying and spreadsheets. Ability to script in R or Python is a plus.
* Data visualization and graphical design skills are a plus.
* Strong interest in research, especially on corporate performance on sustainable development and the business and policy environments that shape that performance.
* Passion for making a difference with a curious mindset and a ‘can do’, hands-on and professional attitude.
* Potential to thrive in a teal culture based on self-managed teams, able to take initiative, self-reflect and collaborate with colleagues.
* Comfortable in a globally inclusive, multi-cultural, fast-paced, agile, and virtual/hybrid environment that promotes flexibility whilst being able to meet deadlines.

**Company**

A.P. Moller-Maersk (Maersk) is a worldwide transport and logistics company with offices in around 130 countries and with global headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark. Maersk is listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Maersk employs roughly 95,000 people and generated total revenue of 51 billion USD in 2023. Maersk is currently undergoing a complex transformation from having been a relatively diversified conglomerate to becoming a focused transport and logistics company.


APM Terminals (APMT), a maritime terminal operator and core business unit of Maersk, operates one of the world’s most comprehensive port networks, which is uniquely positioned to help both shipping line- and landside customers grow their business and achieve better supply chain efficiency, flexibility and dependability to compete and win in world markets. The APMT team of 23,000 industry professionals across 42 countries and spanning five continents, is focused on providing customers with the most advanced terminal technology, equipment and operations in the industry across a network of +75 ports. In 2023, APM Terminals generated revenues 3.8 billion USD and carried out 40 million TEUs.


APMT is, like Maersk, undergoing an all-encompassing transformation from a multi-local, loosely coupled portfolio of individual terminals towards an integrated, best-in-class global terminal operator and stevedore. We casually refer to the journey as ‘ *from freestyle to franchise’* . The transformation involves developing and rolling out APMT’s *Way of Working* , built around a common operating system founded on Lean principles. It also entails a fundamental overhaul of our (digital) enterprise architecture to enable data-fueled business decisions, and cross-pollination of standard processes across our operations, including automation. Finally, the transformation aims to embed a culture of joint problem solving, (local) entrepreneurship and a collaborative mindset across our organization, including strong(er) linkages between our HQ- and frontline teams.

Do you want to help identify how Rabobank can increase its positive impact on nature and reduce its negative impact?

**You and your job**  

As Quantitative Analyst for Biodiversity at RaboResearch you know the secrets of modelling the impact of human activities on nature. This includes combining deep knowledge of top-down models on Nature impact with a good understanding of how bottom-up primary data can be integrated into the picture. You will be part of the team that delivers Rabobank’s first quantitative nature impact report. In addition, as a Quantitative Analyst you create actionable insights on how to implement Rabobank’s Nature vision.

**Inspirational practical examples**

* Connect top-down multi-regional input-output tables with driver-to-pressure models to get a first understanding of financed operations with the largest nature impact.
* Interact with business and remote sensing teams to support the selection of the best bottom-up data to improve the nature impact quantification.
* Engage with scientists and external initiatives to be at the table at the latest developments and collaboratively translate them to Rabobank.

**Work and pleasure**


“*What I really enjoy is developing new footprinting methodologies for nature by connecting theoretical frameworks from academia with the complex reality of business activities that are financed by Rabobank.”*


Felix Beckebanze, Quantitative Analyst with a focus on Biodiversity at RaboResearch.

 **The big picture**


Rabobank finances farmers and food supply chain clients around the world. Farming impacts biodiversity, both positively and negatively. How can we quantify the financed impact on nature? Which type of data do we need to do so? And how can we reduce the negative impact and increase the positive impact? Answering these questions is how you share your talent as a Quantitative Analyst at Rabobank.

**We achieve more together than alone**  

We believe in the power of difference. Bringing together people's differences is what makes us an even better bank. So we are very curious about what you can bring to our team at RaboResearch.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-------------------


  
Het ministerie van BZK ontvangt steeds meer en steeds omvangrijkere Woo-verzoeken. Om te zorgen voor de zorgvuldige én snelle afhandeling zoekt het ministerie enthousiaste en gedreven informatiespecialisten.


Als informatiespecialist werk je aan het efficiënt afhandelen van Woo-verzoeken. In Nederland heeft iedereen - burgers, bedrijven, het parlement en journalisten – recht op toegang tot informatie van de overheid. Dat is vastgelegd in de Wet open overheid (Woo), de opvolger van de Wet openbaarheid bestuur. Het is jouw taak om snel en zorgvuldig de benodigde documenten te vinden. Vervolgens beoordeel je de documenten en bereid je ze voor op openbaarmaking, door het lakken van de juiste informatie (zoals persoonsgegevens). Je werkt nauw samen met interne collega's, zoals dossierhouders en juristen, om ervoor te zorgen dat het proces soepel verloopt. Daarnaast draag je bij aan het verbeteren van onze processen door het implementeren van data-gedreven benaderingen en het verbeteren van onze tooling, zoals de laksoftware.


Je onderhoudt contacten met de collega’s binnen het ministerie en informeert betrokkenen over de voortgang van je werkzaamheden. Je signaleert snel problemen of stagnatie tijdens het afhandelingsproces en escaleert wanneer dat nodig is. Door goed samen te werken en oplossingsgericht te handelen, draag je bij aan een betere afhandeling van Woo-verzoeken.


Daarnaast werken we hard aan procesverbeteringen. Daarom willen wij het zoekproces naar relevante documenten steeds meer informatie gedreven inrichten, waarbij we gebruik maken van slimme tooling. Dat doe je als informatiespecialist door het bouwen van queries met de juiste zoektermen, om zo snel en gemakkelijk de relevantie documenten te vinden.


We zijn volop in ontwikkeling om dit te realiseren en zoeken nieuwe collega’s die hier hun steentje willen bijdragen. Ook draag je bij aan de doorontwikkeling van onze huidige instrumenten en tools, zoals onze laksoftware en de sturingsinformatie in ons dashboard.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
* Je hebt ervaring in een rol als zoekspecialist en met het structuren en doorzoekbaar maken van data;
* Je hebt ervaring met procesverbeteringen en weet die door te voeren;
* Je hebt affiniteit met datagedreven werken en kunt dit vertalen naar jouw functie;
* Je bent gewend te werken met ICT-tools, zoals laksoftware, tooling voor data-analyse, zoek&vind, etc.
* Je weet snel een weg te vinden in verschillende informatiebronnen, zoals ons documentmanagementsysteem, mailboxen en netwerkschijven;
* Je hebt kennis van wettelijke gronden waarop informatie beoordeeld dient te worden of bent bereid dit te leren;
* Je bent flexibel en je werkt graag oplossingsgericht;
* Je bent gewend om gestructureerd en waar nodig onder hoge tijdsdruk te werken;
* Je beschikt over uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.

  
Arbeidsvoorwaarden
------------------


  
* Salarisniveau schaal 10
* Maandsalaris Min €3.404 – Max. €5.389 (bruto)
* Dienstverband Arbeidsovereenkomst voor onbepaalde tijd
* Contractduur N.v.t. (in geval van vast dienstverband)
* Minimaal aantal uren per week 32
* Maximaal aantal uren per week 36

  
Overige arbeidsvoorwaarden
--------------------------


  
Naast het salaris ontvang je een Individueel Keuzebudget (IKB). Het IKB bestaat uit geld (16,50% van je bruto jaarsalaris) en tijd. Met het IKB maak jij de keuzes die bij jou passen en kun je een deel van je arbeidsvoorwaarden zelf samenstellen. Je kunt er bijvoorbeeld voor kiezen om een deel van je maandinkomen te laten uitbetalen wanneer jij dat wenst. Ook kun je dit budget omzetten in verlof en andersom of besteden aan fiscaal vriendelijke doelen. De Rijksoverheid hecht sterk aan persoonlijke groei en loopbaanontwikkeling en biedt daarvoor tal van mogelijkheden. Tot de secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden behoren onder meer verschillende studiefaciliteiten, bedrijfsfitness, volledige vergoeding van je OV-reiskosten woon-werkverkeer en gedeeltelijk betaald ouderschapsverlof.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



In november 2023 is het Woo-team gestart om binnen BZK te zorgen voor een versnelling en verbetering in de afhandeling van Woo-verzoeken. Ons team heeft een centrale plek in de organisatie en ontlast de beleidsdirecties bij het afhandelen van Woo-verzoeken. We werken nauw samen met de juridische afdeling van BZK. In ons team werken informatiespecialisten en Woo-regisseurs samen om de Woo-verzoeker beter van dienst te zijn en te zorgen voor een vlot en open proces. De Woo-regisseur voert regie op het proces en onderhoudt contacten met de verzoeker. We maken nu een vervolgstap in de ontwikkeling van het team. Het Woo-team groeit in aantal collega’s, zodat we bij meer Woo-verzoeken ondersteuning kunnen bieden. Ook breiden we uit qua juridische expertise. Daarmee kunnen we ook meer stappen in het proces ondersteunen.



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.",data journalist,https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl/vacatures/informatiespecialist-woo-verzoeken-BZK-2024-0701,https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/ministerie-van-binnenlandse-zaken-en-koninkrijksrelaties,,,"5,001 to 10,000",,,,,,,57af6ec7f513cb63,,nl,,,

Stel de juiste prioriteiten. Vertaal beleid naar de praktijk. En draag bij aan de informatievoorziening rond 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken per jaar.



Wat doe je als Informatiemanager bij IVO Rechtspraak?



Jouw werk is van grote invloed op de rechtspraak. En daarmee op het leven van mensen. Want de rechtspraak kan niet zonder goede informatie. En die moet voor álle betrokkenen eenvoudig beschikbaar zijn. Van rechters tot burgers die door een geschil of misdaad in een rechtszaak zijn verwikkeld. Jij speelt een centrale rol in die informatievoorziening. Een opdracht op niveau, waarbij de prioriteiten die jij stelt of laat stellen het verschil maken!



Hoe je werk eruitziet



Ieder jaar zijn er zo’n 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken in Nederland. Binnen IVO Rechtspraak hebben we verschillende teams die zich bezighouden met informatievoorziening. In elk team stuurt een portefeuillehouder namens de business met een rechtsgebied als focus: straf, civiel en bestuur, toezicht, familie en jeugd, data en registers, en tot slot bedrijfsvoering. Jij bent de rechterhand van de portefeuillehouder en start bij het IV-team Bedrijfsvoering. De portefeuille Bedrijfsvoering levert generieke diensten aan Rechtspraak-collega's en externe partijen, zoals burgers, rechtzoekenden, journalisten en ketenpartners. De portefeuille is onderverdeeld in de volgende 5 thema's waarbinnen alle verschillende applicaties van Bedrijfsvoering zijn ondergebracht; klantgerichte communicatie en kennisportalen, slim samenwerken en online zitten, creëren en delen van uitspraken, facilitering bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen en digitale informatiehuishouding.



Samen met je collega-informatiemanagers breng jij in kaart welke informatie nodig is om rechtszaken en bedrijfsondersteunende processen optimaal te laten verlopen. Daar maak je voor jouw thema beleid op, ook voor de lange termijn. En je ziet toe op de uitvoering van dat beleid. Zo bouw je mee aan de digitale toekomst van de rechtspraak in ons land.



Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware 2 talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.



Zit je als informatiemanager graag dicht bij het vuur? En wil je de richting van de rechtspraak mee helpen bepalen? Stuur dan direct je sollicitatie!

 **Vacature**

**Communicatiemedewerker GGD** **(24 uur)**

 **Hoe ziet jouw toekomstige werkdag eruit?**  

Je start de werkdag goed met een lekkere kop koffie. Samen met je collega’s praat je bij over het weekend. Maar niet te lang, want aan het begin van de ochtend heb je meteen de weekstart van de GGD. Samen met je communicatiecollega’s bespreek je welke gezondheidsonderwerpen je de komende periode uitlicht. Dit doe je aan de hand van de omgevingsscan waarop je aanhaakt bij de behoefte van de inwoners, de contentplanning en ons jaarplan.


Hierna ga je gelijk aan de slag met het maken van content. De nieuwe social mediacampagne moet namelijk vandaag worden ingepland. Jij weet als geen ander hoe je met creatieve content de doelgroep kan bereiken. Naast je eigen kennis en ervaring, gebruik je hierbij de data en resultaten van eerdere, gelijksoortige campagnes.


De tijd vliegt en voor je het weet is het lunchtijd. Je loopt een rondje met je collega’s om even de benen te strekken. Als je terugkomt start een online meeting met een projectleider over een nieuwe voorlichtingscampagne. Je stelt vragen over doel, doelgroep en adviseert vervolgens over middelen.


Na de meeting neem je de tijd om je mail bij te werken. Je ontving een vraag van een journalist. Samen met de inhoudsdeskundige die de woordvoering doet, formuleer je de antwoorden op de vragen. Later deze week begeleid je het persmoment. Het laatste uur voer je een maandelijkse analyse uit om het gebruikersgedrag op de websites in beeld te brengen. Dit geeft weer nieuwe inzichten om de website te optimaliseren. Voldaan klap je je laptop dicht en verheug je je op morgen. Want morgen is weer een nieuwe dag die totaal anders kan zijn!

**Wat ga je doen?**  

Binnen onze veiligheidsregio hebben we de unieke combinatie van gezondheid (GGD) én veiligheid (Brandweer, Crisisbeheersing). Als communicatiemedewerker richt jij je op operationele taken van de GGD. Jouw werkgebied is breed en omvat afgebakende, uitvoerende werkzaamheden waarbij je nauw samenwerkt en spart met je communicatiecollega's.

Gemiddeld ben je 8 tot 10 keer per jaar een week lang bereikbaar en beschikbaar voor communicatieve werkzaamheden tijdens crisissituaties. Dit doe je samen met andere collega's die piket hebben die week.

**Jouw taken:**

* Content creatie: realiseren van boeiend en inspirerende content voor onze online en offline kanalen.

* Huisstijl bewaken: bewaken en versterken van onze huisstijl in alle communicatie-uitingen
* Media contacten: opbouwen en onderhouden van relaties met de media, en zorgen voor positieve publiciteit en zichtbaarheid.
* Data checken: communicatiekanalen en communicatiecampagnes analyseren en data gebruiken om onze strategieën te verbeteren.
* Samenwerken: met verschillende teams en vormgever om communicatieprojecten van start tot finish te brengen.

**Wat breng je mee?**

* Diploma in communicatie of een vergelijkbare studie.
* Ervaring met traditionele en moderne communicatiemiddelen en campagnes.
* Top skills voor het maken pakkende teksten en beelden waarmee je onze doelgroep raakt.
* Sterk in vormgeving en bekend met tools, zoals Canva.
* Creatief brein met scherp oog voor detail.
* Sterke verbale en schriftelijke communicatie.
* Zelfstarter met een proactieve mindset.
* Analytisch vermogen om social media en websitedata om te zetten in slimme(re) communicatie.
* Echte teamplayer die graag samenwerkt.
* Passie voor verhalen vertellen en het bouwen van een sterk merk.
* Coachende vaardigheden en het vermogen om collega's te begeleiden en afdelingen te ondersteunen bij hun communicatie.

**Jouw team:**  

Je werkt in een leuk en enthousiast communicatieteam met 12 collega’s. Een team dat grotendeels bestaat uit jonge professionals, maar ook met enkele collega’s die al langer in het vak zitten. We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**  

Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA. Je komt te werken in een crisisorganisatie vol afwisseling. De coronacrisis, vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne, het hoogwater van de Maas of een grote brand. Wij waren erbij betrokken. Als communicatiemedewerker zit je bij ons nooit stil.


Je kunt je eigen werktijden en werkplek bepalen. Wij werken vanuit vertrouwen waarbij vrijheden en verantwoordelijkheden hand in hand gaan. Er zijn dus volop mogelijkheden om je privé- en werksituatie met elkaar te combineren.

Van leidinggeven aan je collega’s tot het ontwikkelen van een visie voor onze unit: in deze veelzijdige rol zorg jij voor een soepele informatieverstrekking aan onze partners.

Waarom goede Informatieverstrekking vanuit de RDW belangrijk is? De data waarover de RDW beschikt speelt elke dag een grote en belangrijke rol in de maatschappij: in de rechtszekerheid van mensen, in duurzaamheid, en vooral in de veiligheid van ons allemaal. En daarin speel jij als unitmanager Informatieverstrekking een belangrijke rol!

Werken aan de mobiliteit van morgen  
Van de politie die informatie opvraagt over een kenteken tot een journalist die onderzoeksvragen heeft over kentekens en rijbewijzen in Nederland: als unitmanager zorg jij dat alle externe partijen op tijd de juiste informatie krijgen. Je geeft leiding aan collega’s en zet hen in hun kracht, ontwikkelt strategische plannen en realiseert afspraken en doelen volgens het managementcontract. Je zorgt ook dat we de wet- en regelgeving naleven, bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van privacy en verbetert onze rol als nationaal contactpunt voor internationale gegevensuitwisseling. Bovendien werk je samen met onze relatiemanagers om effectief contact te houden met externe partners, zoals brancheorganisaties en medeoverheden.

Daarnaast ben je teamlid van het managementteam van de afdeling, met wie je het beleid ontwikkelt en afstemt. We zijn volop bezig met de doorontwikkeling van onze afdeling. Jij helpt ons de volgende stap te zetten: je kijkt hoe we onze dienstverlening beter kunnen structureren en professionaliseren, bijvoorbeeld met de inzet van data-intelligence. Je houdt externe ontwikkelingen in de gaten, vertaalt deze naar onze afdeling en je unit en zet kansen voor innovatie om in projecten. Daarvoor werk je nauw samen met ICT-serviceteams om te zorgen dat de oplossingen onze doelen ondersteunen. Ook ben je opdrachtgever van stuurgroepen bij multidisciplinaire projecten.

Vertaal beleid naar de praktijk. En draag bij aan de informatievoorziening rond 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken per jaar.**


**Wat doe je als Informatiemanager bij IVO Rechtspraak?**
---------------------------------------------------------


Jouw werk is van grote invloed op de rechtspraak. En daarmee op het leven van mensen. Want de rechtspraak kan niet zonder goede informatie. En die moet voor álle betrokkenen eenvoudig beschikbaar zijn. Van rechters tot burgers die door een geschil of misdaad in een rechtszaak zijn verwikkeld. Jij speelt een centrale rol in die informatievoorziening. Een opdracht op niveau, waarbij de prioriteiten die jij stelt of laat stellen het verschil maken!


### **Hoe je werk eruitziet**


Ieder jaar zijn er zo’n 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken in Nederland. Binnen IVO Rechtspraak hebben we verschillende teams die zich bezighouden met informatievoorziening. In elk team stuurt een portefeuillehouder namens de business, met een rechtsgebied als focus: straf, civiel en bestuur, toezicht, familie en jeugd, Data en Registers en tot slot bedrijfsvoering. Jij bent de rechterhand van de portefeuillehouder en start bij het IV-team Bedrijfsvoering. De portefeuille Bedrijfsvoering levert generieke diensten aan Rechtspraak collega's en externe partijen, zoals burgers, rechtzoekenden, journalisten en ketenpartners. De portefeuille is onderverdeeld in de volgende vijf thema's waarbinnen alle verschillende applicaties van Bedrijfsvoering zijn ondergebracht; klantgerichte communicatie en kennisportalen, slim samenwerken en online zitten, creëren en delen van uitspraken, facilitering bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen en digitale informatiehuishouding


Samen met je collega-informatiemanagers breng jij in kaart welke informatie nodig is om rechtszaken en bedrijfsondersteunende processen optimaal te laten verlopen. Daar maak je voor jouw thema beleid op, ook voor de lange termijn. En je ziet toe op de uitvoering van dat beleid. Zo bouw je mee aan de digitale toekomst van de rechtspraak in ons land.


Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware twee talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.


Zit je als informatiemanager graag dicht bij het vuur? En wil je de richting van de rechtspraak mee helpen bepalen? Stuur dan direct je sollicitatie!

**Team Code**


Team Code houdt zich bezig met ontwerpend onderzoek. We ontwerpen nieuwe technologie en nemen publieke waarden als uitgangspunt: technologie is namelijk niet zomaar een instrument, maar kan het (samen)leven van mensen diepgaand beïnvloeden. Code kijkt hoe technologie de positie van burgers kan versterken: democratisering door middel van digitalisering. Het team bestaat uit software ontwerpers, techniek filosofen en sociale wetenschappers.

**Over Waag Futurelab**


Waag Futurelab doet al bijna 30 jaar onderzoek naar hoe technologie kan worden ingezet voor sociale innovatie. Bekende projecten van Waag zijn o.a. Fairphone, de meest duurzame smartphone ter wereld of De Digitale Stad, een van de allereerste social media platforms van Nederland. Of denk aan Operatie Sigismund, een van de eerste educatieve games in Nederland die leerlingen laat ervaren hoe spannend een archief is en nog steeds wekelijks gespeeld wordt in het Drents Archief.


 Je toekomstige collega Ouarda vertelt over werken bij Waag*: ‘De vrijheid die ik van de organisatie krijg om mijn eigen projecten in te kleuren doet mij heel erg goed. Collega’s waarderen mij, ik kan mezelf zijn en dat maakt het een fijne werkplek.’*


Waag werkt in een team van ontwerpers, kunstenaars en wetenschappers, dat publieke onderzoeksmethoden toepast op technologie en de samenleving. Daarmee stelt Waag zoveel mogelijk mensen in staat mee te ontwerpen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Dat doen we door gezamenlijk opkomende technologie te onderzoeken en onderliggende culturele aannames te bevragen en door alternatieven te ontwerpen op basis van publieke waarden. Zo proberen we bij te dragen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Op waag.org vind je meer informatie over Waag en over de projecten waaraan wij werken.


Diversiteit is cruciaal om technologie en de samenleving meer open, eerlijk en inclusief te maken. Daarom moedigen we kandidaten van diverse culturele achtergronden aan om te solliciteren. Mocht je denken niet aan alle eisen te voldoen, willen we je toch aanmoedigen om te solliciteren. Sommige kwaliteiten zijn niet in bulletpoints te vangen.

Van werkstress tot machineveiligheid en van hybride werken tot gevaarlijke stoffen. Arbo is het platform dat arboprofessionals ondersteunt in hun dagelijks werk. Door ze te informeren over ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken. Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.  

  

**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.



Als hoofdredacteur Arbo ben je onderdeel van de centrale redactie van het ‘professionals portfolio’ van VMN media, waar ook PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb onderdeel van zijn. Samen zijn we een team van 14 personen.

 **Wat krijg je:**


* **Fijn team** – Leuke, betrokken collega’s die samen mooie content voor de doelgroep maken. Binnen het Arbo-team, maar ook in nauwe samenwerking binnen het professionals portfolio.
* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.



Verder nog handig om te weten: het gaat om een functie van 36 uur per week. Het kantoor van VMN media staat in Zeist.
