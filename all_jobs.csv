**The Opportunity: Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst**


We are looking for an experienced Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst to take a lead role in transforming data into actionable insights that drive strategic decision\-making across the company. In this hands\-on role, you will design and deliver business\-critical dashboards and analytical reports that inform how we improve patient access and grow our business. As a senior individual contributor on our Data \& Analytics team, you’ll work alongside a Data Engineer and fellow Analysts within our Product \& Engineering organization. You will collaborate cross\-functionally with stakeholders in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial, and Product, becoming a go\-to expert for data insights.


**What You'll be Doing:**


In your first 3–6 months, you will hit the ground running by spearheading the creation of several high\-impact dashboards, including:

* Client Program Performance Dashboards – to monitor and visualize our patient programs' performance and identify opportunities to improve outcomes.
* Revenue Tracking Dashboards – to provide real\-time visibility into revenue streams and financial KPIs, helping steer commercial strategy.
* Patient Source Attribution Dashboards – to trace and illustrate how patients find our platform (using tools like Sankey diagrams for flow visualization), informing marketing and outreach efforts.

**This is the right opportunity for you if:**

* Design, build, and maintain interactive dashboards and reports in Tableau (and other BI tools) to track key metrics across the business. You will own end\-to\-end dashboard development – from gathering requirements to data modeling and visualization – ensuring stakeholders have self\-service access to up\-to\-date insights.
* Deliver actionable insights for growth: Analyze operational and marketing data (from MySQL/PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases, Airflow, Excel, etc.) to understand key performance drivers. Translate data into clear findings and recommendations that drive user acquisition, patient engagement, and sustainable business growth.
* Be the analytical partner for leadership: Serve as a point of contact for the leadership team on all things data. Provide in\-depth reporting, ad\-hoc analysis, and executive\-friendly dashboards that inform strategic decisions and highlight trends in business performance.
* Focus on data quality and accuracy: Work closely with our Data Engineer and product engineers to ensure we have reliable, well\-structured data. Help maintain and validate data models, databases and data pipelines so that reports are accurate and reflect the single source of truth. Identify any data gaps or integrity issues and collaborate on solutions.
* Drive performance improvements: Monitor key KPIs (such as program success metrics, funnel conversion rates, revenue metrics) and proactively identify operational bottlenecks or areas for improvement. Provide insight\-driven suggestions to optimize workflows, improve patient recruitment, or streamline processes.
* Cross\-functional collaboration: Partner with teams in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial and Product to understand their analytics needs. Support these stakeholders by building custom reports or exploratory analysis, and ensure they can leverage your dashboards for day\-to\-day decision making. For example, you might deep\-dive into marketing funnel data to advise the Growth team, or analyze operational turnaround times to assist the Operations team.
* Advanced analysis and data exploration: Use Python (with pandas, numpy, etc.) and SQL for deeper ad\-hoc analyses, data discovery, and data preparation. When questions go beyond existing reports, you’ll dig into raw data to uncover insights, validate hypotheses, and prepare datasets for further analysis.
* Mentorship and best practices: As a senior analyst, mentor and guide junior analysts on the team. Review their work, share knowledge of best practices in analytics, SQL querying, and visualization. Lead by example in documentation and reproducibility. You will also enable business users’ self\-service by training stakeholders on how to use established dashboards and reporting tools effectively.
* Shape data strategy: Contribute to our overall data strategy by identifying new metrics or analytics opportunities that can drive value. Advocate for a data\-driven mindset across the organization. You’ll play a key role in evolving our analytics capabilities (for instance, suggesting new BI features or improving reporting processes) to support a scaling, high\-growth environment.

**You Have:**

* Experience: 5\+ years in data analytics, business intelligence, or a similar role, with a track record of handling complex data projects and delivering insights to business stakeholders. Experience in a growth\-stage tech company or digital health environment is a plus.
* Strong proficiency in SQL (ability to write complex queries in MySQL/PostgreSQL). Hands\-on experience with data visualization tools, especially Tableau (or similar BI platforms), to create dynamic dashboards. Familiarity with NoSQL databases and tools like Airflow is beneficial. Advanced Excel skills for quick analysis and data prep.
* Experience using Python for data analysis tasks – e.g. data cleaning, exploration, and validation using libraries such as pandas or numpy. Must be comfortable scripting to manipulate data when needed.
* Present data in a clear and compelling way. Experience creating a variety of chart types and visuals – from standard bar/line charts to more advanced visuals like Sankey diagrams or funnel charts – to illustrate user flows and attribution. An eye for design and attention to detail in dashboards ensuring they are accurate, easy to interpret, and visually engaging.
* Analytical Mindset: Excellent analytical and problem\-solving skills. Capable of interpreting complex datasets, identifying trends and outliers, and connecting the dots between data and business outcomes. You approach problems with curiosity and a hypothesis\-driven mindset.
* Business Acumen: Strong understanding of business metrics and growth drivers. Ability to translate business questions from non\-technical stakeholders into analytical approaches, and then translate back findings into business terms. Experience working on metrics like revenue, conversion funnels, customer acquisition cost, etc., is highly valued.
* Exceptional communication skills in English (our company language). You can distill complex analyses into clear insights and narratives for different audiences. Comfortable presenting findings to senior leadership and guiding discussions on data.
* Collaboration: Proven ability to work cross\-functionally and build positive relationships with diverse teams — from operations managers to product designers. You’re a team player who can align data projects with the needs of multiple departments and manage stakeholder expectations.
* Leadership \& Mentorship: Demonstrated experience mentoring junior analysts or leading analytical projects. You enjoy helping others grow their skills and can influence without formal authority. You’re enthusiastic about sharing knowledge and establishing best practices for analytics within a team.
* Self\-Driven \& Organized: Thrives in a fast\-paced, high\-growth environment. Able to manage and prioritize multiple projects and requests, deliver on deadlines, and adapt to evolving business needs. You take ownership of your work and proactively seek out ways to add value.
* Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in a relevant field (e.g. Data Science, Statistics, Business, Computer Science, or similar) is preferred, or equivalent practical experience in data analysis roles.

**What we offer**

* Impactful work that helps patients gain access to potentially lifesaving treatments.

In this thesis, you will generate synthetic training data by transforming low\-poly 3D models of hands and feet into photorealistic images with labeled key points. Using techniques like pix2pix GANs, you’ll explore and optimize the process to create a diverse and enriched dataset, enhancing pose estimation models for AI\-driven Parkinson’s symptom analysis.**

**Areas of Interest:** Generative AI, Controllable Image Generation, Few\-shot Learning


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


The examination of Parkinson’s symptoms is highly labor\-intensive, as it requires multiple trained neurologists to thoroughly analyze hand and leg movements. A group of hospitals aims to extend Parkinson’s treatment in the Netherlands to regions where such care is currently unavailable due to a shortage of trained neurologists. To achieve this, they want to make a pre\-selection through the help of AI on a smartphone. Part of the solution is a pose estimation model to track hand and foot movements. However, the current dataset for training the model is neither large nor diverse enough. The goal is to enrich the dataset with highly varied data while minimizing the need for manual effort.


Important features for detecting hands and feet could be better balanced by enriching the training dataset with synthetic data. To prevent manual labeling of the training data, it would be ideal if the ground truth for tracking key points is synthesized along with the training images. By converting low\-poly 3D models with key point rigs into photorealistic images, a synthetic dataset of labeled training images could be generated. Your task will be to investigate how to transform low\-poly models into photorealistic images using AI.

**The Assignment**
------------------


You will create a training dataset consisting of low\-poly 3D body rigs, focusing on the hands and feet. Next, you will explore transforming these low\-poly models into photorealistic images using a pix2pix GAN model. You may also fine\-tune the model to optimize hyperparameters for generating the best results. Your findings will be documented in a thesis and presented during your thesis defense.

However, these systems present challenges, particularly with model agnostic explanations which are more approximations. This includes global and local explanations, with local ones possibly misleading due to their narrow focus. Effective testing is crucial to verify if explanations are sensible to experts, consistent across different outcomes, and to understand when they might change.**

**Areas of Interest:** Artificial Intelligence, Explainable AI


Explainable machine learning and artificial intelligence models have been used to justify a model’s decision\-making process. This added transparency aims to help improve user performance and understanding of the underlying model. However, in practice, explainable systems face many open questions and challenges.


Model agnostic explanations are more approximations. In general there are two kinds of explanations: global and local explanations. For the latter, there’s the possibility that the explanation is off, because it only looks at the local inference. It’s possible that for opposite inference, we get exactly the same explanations. To get proper explanations we’ll need to be able to test them. Are the explanations sensible to business experts and aren’t there any same explanations for opposite outcomes? And do we know when explanations will change?

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

We’re crafting a metric that measures how achievable AI\-generated advice is—for real people. Think of it as teaching AI common sense; for instance, you can’t just age a decade instantly. Your challenge: integrate advanced language models like GPT to gauge if a “what if” scenario is useful or just a tech fantasy. Join us in shaping a more sensible, user\-centric AI future.**

**Areas of Interest:** XAI/Explainable AI, LLMs/Large Language Models, ChatGPT, NLP/Natural Language Processing


Counterfactual explanations are considered an intuitive and user\-friendly form of explainable AI. A counterfactual explanation proposes minimal changes to the input data that would lead to a different model output. As an example, a bank could make use of a model to determine if a customer can get a loan or not. If a customer was denied a loan, a counterfactual explanation could tell them that, for instance, “if their savings were increased by 10\.000€, they could get the loan”.


However, counterfactual explanations are not aware of the semantics of the input features. It might be that the minimal change for a customer to get a loan is to “increase their age from 25 to 35 years old” which, from a human perspective, is evidently unfeasible in a short time span.

**The Assignment**
------------------


In this project, we would like you to design a new evaluation metric to automatically determine the practicality of counterfactuals, that is, how attainable a counterfactual explanation is (or if it is even humanly attainable). Since the determination of practicality involves semantic understanding of the input features, our idea would be to leverage GPT and/or other large language model\-based technologies to accomplish this.


A user study could be conducted initially following the methodology proposed by Spreitzer et al (1\) to evaluate the practicality of different state\-of\-the\-art counterfactual techniques. The user study can then be extended to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed metric compared to the human evaluations.

 What we offer
   

  

**About Us**
 We are Xomnia, the AI consulting company. We’re curious problem solvers who believe data will change the way we live, work and communicate. Being at the forefront of this revolutionary change in a sustainable, positive way is what drives us.
   

  

 We solve challenging data science and engineering projects, from start to finish. From developing an application for real\-time fraud detection on Google Cloud Platform, to setting up a customized recommender engine in an existing Microsoft Azure environment \- we develop and deploy tailor\-made data science solutions.
   

  

 Xomnia started in 2013 in one room in the heart of Amsterdam. These days we take up nearly two houses. But more than just a workspace, we're a community that values authenticity. Here, everyone is encouraged to be themselves, to learn, and to have fun in the process.
   

  

 Representing over 20 nationalities, our team values the unique cultural perspective that each individual brings to the table. Moreover, with the Dutch tech sector seeing a female representation around 11%, we are proud that over 30% of our workforce is female. Nevertheless, we recognize that there is more to be done, and we continue working to overcome barriers that still exist.
   

  

 We encourage all candidates to apply, and we don’t discriminate based on race, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age. However, a reality that we face is that many of our clients prefer to communicate in Dutch, making Dutch proficiency essential for some roles. Additionally, while we wish that we could sponsor visas for everyone, there are instances when it is not feasible.
   

  

 If you're experienced, passionate, and align with our values, we want to hear from you.",Information Technology & Services,https://nl.linkedin.com/company/xomnia,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEMxcvPDbBSiQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1724141336408/xomnia_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=0v5TZXJBHiKRXgKL2iodt4MaQoB-A_OFbbEE8e8kKF0,,,,,,,,,,,,ai engineer,linkedin,en

Our clients offer top\-tier pay for top\-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Trilogy. Have you got what it takes?
   

  

 Master AI\-Driven Development or Step Aside. For Engineers Who Ship, Not Talk.
   

  

 Most development teams still operate in the dark ages—manual code reviews, reactive debugging, and AI as an afterthought. At Trilogy, we've rewritten the rules. Our entire engineering ecosystem breathes AI—from ideation to deployment, bug detection to optimization. This isn't about occasionally using AI tools; it's about fundamentally transforming how software gets built.
   

  

 We're seeking elite developers who refuse to accept the status quo of traditional software engineering. You'll deconstruct established B2B products and rebuild them as cloud\-native powerhouses with AI intelligence embedded at every level. You'll deploy features that leverage cutting\-edge retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG), automate defect detection, and deliver flawlessly—zero downtime, zero compromises.
   

  

 If you're ready to operate at the bleeding edge where AI meets software engineering, this position will accelerate your career trajectory. If you prefer architecture debates over shipping code or manual processes over automation, look elsewhere.
   

  

**What You Will Be Doing**
* Harness advanced RAG vector stores and AI analysis tools to systematically identify, diagnose, and eliminate product defects with unprecedented efficiency
* Architect and implement AI development agents that transform how features are designed, developed, and deployed across cloud\-native applications
* Drive enterprise\-grade solutions through strategic collaboration with a distributed global engineering team


**What You Won’t Be Doing**
* Managing infrastructure overhead: Our streamlined processes eliminate traditional DevOps burdens so you can focus exclusively on high\-impact development
* Sitting through productivity\-killing meetings: We prioritize your technical output over discussion—expect focused collaboration, not endless conversation
* Writing code the conventional way: If your workflow still begins with manual coding rather than AI\-assisted generation, this position isn't aligned with our approach


**Full Stack Developer Key Responsibilities**
 Accelerate business transformation by implementing AI\-driven features that revolutionize service provider workflows and deliver measurable competitive advantage in the market.
   

  

**Basic Requirements**
* Demonstrated AI\-First Development Mindset: You must approach problems by leveraging AI capabilities first, then enhancing with human expertise—not the reverse
* 4\+ years of production software development experience with server\-side web applications
* Proven track record building mission\-critical B2B software applications that meet enterprise reliability standards
* Deep expertise in cloud\-native development and serverless architectures, specifically within AWS environments
* Advanced proficiency with GenAI code assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor.sh, v0\.dev) in professional development contexts
* Verifiable success implementing Generative AI solutions with quantifiable business impact


**About Trilogy**
 Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses. Our technological innovation is spearheaded by a passion for simple customer\-facing designs. Our incubation of new businesses ranges from entirely new moon\-shot ideas to rearchitecting existing projects for today's modern cloud\-based stack.

 You’ll join 15 analysts in Bol’s advertising analytics organization. Together you share a mission of making people performant through analytics. This role is for the versatile analyst, one that is equally comfortable talking to data as to stakeholders. Your stakeholders can be colleagues from the Advertising and Product domains as well as advertiser customers. Your days vary but at the core you’ll use SQL/Python/Tableau/dbt/git to provide metrics, analysis, and predictions that help advertisers make better decisions.
   

  

 You’ll collaborate with stakeholders to understand business needs, identify key performance metrics, define high value use cases for analytics to help advertising customers make better decisions. Your work will be input for amongst others client meetings, white papers, webinars, and public industry appearances.
   

  

* Analysing advertising KPIs in all stages of the Media Funnel and identifying relevant shopper behaviour across their journeys. You'll use your analytical skills to uncover patterns and insights in our data that help us understand how to optimize the effectiveness of our advertising propositions.
* Working closely with internal stakeholders (Sales, Customer Success, and Marketing) and top advertising and agency customers to identify high value applications of analytics. You use your data expertise to help guide decision\-making processes and ensure that data\-driven insights and recommendations are central to retail media plans.
* Developing extensive domain knowledge across our business to effectively manage and analyse advertising KPIs delivered through presentations, dashboards, white papers or public industry appearances.
* Developing high\-quality data pipelines for dashboarding and KPIs in collaboration with our analytical engineers (using dbt), ensuring that the data we use for reporting and analysis is accurate, complete, and up\-to\-date.
* Writing high\-quality and easily interpretable SQL and Python code that can be reused. You'll use your SQL skills to query large, complex datasets, extracting the data needed to answer key business questions. You'll also ensure that your SQL and Python code is reusable, well\-documented, and easily interpretable by other members of the team.


**Why you can make the difference?**
 You’re an enthusiastic team player who lives and breathes analytics. The ideal candidate for this role has a strong analytical mindset, a healthy appetite for making business impact and excellent communication and collaboration skills. You have experience working with SQL and dashboarding tools like Tableau and are comfortable navigating and analysing large, complex datasets. You also have a knack for translating complex data insights into clear, actionable recommendations.
   

  

**3 reasons why this is (not) for you** 
**Switch to find out**
* \- If you strongly value clarity No, if innovating, autonomy, and ambiguity sound terrifying to you.
* \- You only want to process data No, if you only want to process data and prefer someone else to handle project and stakeholder management.
* \- If you believe analysts don’t need domain knowledge No, if you don't want to dive into the world of advertising. Curiosity and willingness to learn about our domain and customers are key to your success.
* \+ You’re an analytics professional Yes, if you have 5\+ year experience delighting decision makers with your analytical skills. SQL is a must, Python scripting is a strong plus.
* \+ Obsess over creating value for advertisers Yes, if you believe output does not equal outcome and judge success by value creation.
* \+ You get (and create) energy by working with others Yes, if you can translate technical information into language anyone can understand. You enjoy working with both data and people.

Smart lighting goes far beyond simply switching lights on and off. We use our wireless mesh networks to control lighting and serve as a backbone for smarter buildings. This enables use cases such as tracking medical equipment, people counting, climate monitoring, and more.
 



  





 Our solution excels in the strength of our wireless mesh network, which is far more scalable and robust than any of our competitors. This enables us to cover cases and buildings that no one else can, such as explosion\-proof environments (refineries, mines), container ships, and similar challenging locations. We achieve this in collaboration with our wireless partner Wirepas, which provides industry\-leading IoT technology.
 



 The future of our solution is bright. Industry giants like ABB, Siemens, and Schneider Electric have announced plans to develop a new standard for wireless smart buildings using the same Wirepas technology that we use. This puts us in a leading global position to provide lighting control within this new standard. See:
 



  





 Our solution is deployed worldwide through partners such as Trilux, Royal BAM, Equans, and Schneider Electric, operating in countries including the U.S., Australia, South Korea, Brazil, France, the UK, and many more. Despite our global reach and collaboration with multi\-billion\-dollar clients, we remain a small, agile team (currently 15 people). We maintain short lines of communication and a fast\-paced, startup mentality. Expect to work closely with customers, see your code deployed on large\-scale sites rapidly, and make meaningful contributions to advancing our product. This is not the place for someone looking to hide in a corner and simply tick off Jira tickets!
 



  





**Your Role \& Responsibilities** 




 Ingy provides its products for truly large scale installations in warehouses, logistics centers, large office buildings: up to thousands of devices with multiple gateways each connected to the cloud. Ingy is evolving into a scale\-up, prioritizing the automation of provisioning new sites, supporting and diagnosing existing ones, and onboarding new partners. This transition requires a robust cloud infrastructure, where you will play a key role as a main contributor.
 



  





**Examples of Projects You'll Be Working On** 



* Use infrastructure\-as\-code (Terraform) to \- with one click of a button \- deploy our entire infrastructure on thousands of gateways supporting millions of devices.
* Completely revamp our firmware delivery to enable one\-click deployment of new software to hundreds of devices across dozens of manufacturers.
* Create a highly flexible, container\-based infrastructure where Docker containers can be seamlessly moved between gateways and the cloud for an optimal support experience.
* Creating the data infrastructure to store, analyse and display data collected by hundreds of thousands of sensors, sending data every few minutes.
* Add LLM based functionality to analyse and interact with the data stored.



  





**About the Team** 




 Ingy is a fast\-paced startup transitioning into a scale\-up. We have built a highly skilled, ambitious team with expertise across front\-end, cloud, gateways, and firmware. While everyone has at least one specialization, we value flexibility and encourage team members to expand their skills into at least one or two additional areas.
 



 We foster a culture of continuous learning and support personal growth. There are no rigid career steps—you can grow as quickly and in whatever direction suits you best, whether it's deep algorithmic coding, architecture, customer interaction, project management, Scrum mastery, or product management.
 



 Collaboration is key. All code is peer\-reviewed, and we see this as an opportunity to become better engineers every day. You are expected to actively contribute to the growth of your colleagues whenever possible.
 



 We also embrace innovation and strongly encourage you to explore and apply the latest LLM tools to enhance productivity and code quality.
 



 Our team is heavily technology\-focused—expect lunchtime discussions on everything from Minecraft to the validity of the Chinese Room Argument. And yes,
 *42* 
 is always a good answer.
 



  





**Your Skills \& Qualifications** 




 We are hiring for a junior position (0\-3 years of experience). While we welcome candidates with a broad skill set and diverse interests, you must have cloud development experience. This could come from your education, graduation project, or personal work, but you must have used Terraform or an alternative infrastructure\-as\-code approach.
 



  





**Must\-Have Skills** 



* Strong understanding of cloud computing, including:
* Building cloud infrastructure using infrastructure\-as\-code (Terraform)
* Good understanding of security principles (ideally tailored to AWS services and in general, no use of long\-term credentials, secure in transit and at rest, traceability, etc.)
* Containerization, dockers, orchestration
* Familiarity with cloud infrastructure, especially AWS (Cognito, Timestream, IoTcore, IoT greengrass)
* Knowledge of GitHub/Bitbucket pipelines, REST interfaces, the MQTT protocol, Linux systems, DNS records
* Understanding of trade\-offs between creating scalable services (in the cloud) and keeping things local from perspectives of availability, pricing, latency, etc.



  





**Bonus Skills (Highly Valued!)** 



* Experience with Python, Javascript, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Pulumi, Raspberry PIs
* Personal IoT projects or an active GitHub portfolio

Yes, we’re looking for a Full\-stack web developer. And yes, there are plenty of other opportunities out there. If you’re exploring your options, you might be thinking about growth, creativity, a sense of purpose, or just a healthier work\-life balance. We get it—everyone wants their own version of a “perfect fit.”
 



  




 So here’s why you might consider AIAIAI:
 
  





 We’re an early\-stage startup with significant traction, on track to become cashflow positive this year—so there’s no frantic chasing of funding to stay afloat. Our team is small (currently 8 of us) by design, and we plan to grow to around 15 by the end of the year to ensure profitability. From there, we’ll scale linearly—about 3–5 new hires a month—depending on our sales results.
 



  





 You’ll be working with an experienced development team that’s already built and scaled successful SAAS products. AIAIAI itself was born out of two sister companies, Lifely and Nucleoo, giving you access to a broader network of colleagues and experts in Amsterdam, Granada, and Madrid. We hope you look back in 20 years and say, “That’s where I did some of the most impactful and fulfilling work of my life.”
 



  





 AI—yes, it’s a buzzword filled with smoke and mirrors. That’s not us (or at least, we’re trying not to be). Because no matter how slowly actual adoption might be happening, we’re all being affected by AI in one way or another—teachers feeling the pressure to adapt, office employees expected to deliver more in less time. There’s a huge segment of people, especially once you drive a bit outside big cities, who aren’t “prompting” or tapping into AI to boost productivity. Their jobs—and the relevance of their employers—is at risk. That’s what we address at
 



  





 AIAIAI: helping everyday people use AI in a way that feels natural to them. We meet them where they are, instead of asking them to change. We’ve designed our product so that both employees and companies don’t end up saying “AI AI AI” three years from now because they were blindsided. It’s a product being used daily by users who’d typically fall into the late majority or even “laggards” on the adoption curve. And that’s the mission you’d help drive: making a fast\-changing world a bit more manageable for people who just need it to work.
   




 What can you expect from the role?
 
 As our Full\-stack web developer, you’ll help shape the core architecture of our platform—both front\-end and back\-end. You’ll be part of key decisions on how we build and scale, working alongside product managers, designers, and fellow engineers. You'll also implement AI features into our products, integrating with machine learning models, and crafting intelligent user experiences that leverage the latest AI technologies.

As our Backend Engineer, you'll design and scale backend infrastructure that powers LLMs and intelligent AI agents used across legal workflows.** 




  





**About Zeno** 




 Zeno is a legal AI startup building the next generation of intelligent software for legal professionals. The legal world runs on documents, context, and nuance — and we’re building AI tools that deeply understand that. Our end\-to\-end platform combines advanced language models, retrieval systems, and document intelligence to support the full legal workflow: from research and drafting to bulk contract review.
 



 We’re not just building features — we’re rethinking how legal knowledge work is done. Our clients include top\-tier law firms (50\+ FTE), and we’ve secured €2M in funding. Everything we build is hosted securely in Europe, fully ISO 27001 certified.
 



 What makes us unique is our approach: no shallow AI integrations, but agentic systems designed for real\-world performance and legal\-grade reliability. Everything is built in\-house by a small team of highly technical founders (backgrounds in AI, theoretical physics, infra), based in Rotterdam.
 



 You’ll join us at a pivotal moment. The foundation is there, the traction is real, and we’re scaling. As engineer \#5 or \#6, you’ll shape what Zeno becomes — in code, architecture, and culture.
 



  





**Use AI to help legal professionals think, reason, and draft smarter.** 




  





**Architect the systems that turn AI into real\-world legal tools** 




 Zeno’s platform depends on fast, scalable, and secure backend systems to make complex legal workflows usable and intelligent. As a Backend Engineer, you’ll take the lead in designing robust API infrastructure that enables our AI agents to reason over legal content, process documents at scale, and deliver precise outputs to our users. This role combines architectural thinking with hands\-on development — perfect for engineers who want to shape the core of an AI\-first product.
 



  





**What you'll do:** 



* Design and build RESTful APIs (FastAPI) that power our core platform features
* Integrate backend systems with AI agents, document parsers, and retrieval pipelines
* Own the backend for core legal workflows: from document upload to AI\-generated output
* Monitor and improve backend performance, reliability, and security
* Collaborate with AI engineers to align infrastructure with model needs and constraints



  





**What we're looking for:** 



* 3\+ years of backend experience with Python, ideally using FastAPI
* Experience with relational (PostgreSQL) and/or graph/vector databases (e.g. GraphDB, Pinecone)
* Solid understanding of API architecture, service orchestration, and system design
* Someone who likes to build clean, maintainable systems with real\-world usage in mind



  





**What we offer:** 



* A unique opportunity to work at a startup that is shaping the future of legal tech
* The ability to make a direct and tangible impact on the development and growth of our platform
* An inspiring place to work in an office located at the heart of Rotterdam
* Collaboration with a top\-tier team of engineers, researchers, and entrepreneurs
* Competitive compensation, including growth and equity opportunities within the company



  





**Recruitment process via Haystack People** 




 Zeno works exclusively with Haystack People to fill these key roles. Haystack helps us connect with engineers who can build exceptional systems and thrive in a culture of autonomy, focus, and momentum. You’ll be supported throughout the process — from first intro to final offer — by an experienced consultant who understands both the role and the team behind it. Interested or have questions?

Additionally, you will assist our client teams in developing strategies and technology roadmaps for implementing processes and operating systems that support applications connected to digital service operations.
As part of your role, you will help clients imagine and implement the future of service delivery—where AI, GenAI, and agentic technologies are reshaping how services are designed, delivered, and scaled.
You will work with cross\-functional teams to explore AI\-native operating models, integrate intelligent agents into service ecosystems, and help client’s future\-proof their service strategies by embedding emerging technologies across front\- and back\-office operations.
While hands\-on experience in these areas is a plus, what matters most is your ability to think ahead, connect technology to business outcomes, and inspire bold change.
You will also gain new skills and build on the strengths you bring to the firm. You will receive exceptional training, frequent coaching, and ongoing mentoring from colleagues and senior leaders on your teams.
As part of our two\-year Operations Excellence Program (OEP), you will work on client engagements in the same way as any other McKinsey consultant. You will gain leading edge operations and consultancy skills, primarily through on\-the\-job coaching, which will be complemented by the OEP’s structured capability\-building program.
We view the OEP position as the start of a rewarding, challenging and highly flexible career with McKinsey and the Operations practice. During your first few years with the firm, you will serve as a junior practice specialist on multiple client engagements and work with a number of colleagues and clients in a range of industry and operations service lines. You will acquire the necessary knowledge and expertise to help companies achieve excellence in their operations.
Along with other members of the OEP community, you will dedicate many days to functional training and knowledge development under the leadership of our operations experts. You will follow a curriculum based on operations excellence themes and will receive advanced training in one of six specific areas of operations: manufacturing, product development, purchasing, service operations, supply chain management, or capital excellence.
Upon completion of the program, successful consultants will join our global group of leading experts in operational excellence. We already have OEP graduates working at all levels of the firm from associate to partner.
Your application should be in English and include your CV and your transcripts (high school, university, etc.), indicating all relevant grades.

At Stacks, we’re transforming the way finance teams approach one of their most critical processes: the monthly close.

**Job Description**
 Direct Air Capture (DAC) is seen as a key actor in achieving net zero emissions by 2050\. This technology can achieve net negative emissions by capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide. The majority of the costs of DAC are associated with energy expense for sorbent regeneration, and replacement of sorbent material due to degradation. In current DAC devices with a granular sorbent bed, a notable part of energy is used by fans to move large amounts of air through the sorbent. The fan power is proportional to the pressure drop over the bed, a parameter largely controlled by the structure of the sorbent.
   

  

**Required**
 Monoliths acting as sorbent support are known to be advantageous compared to packed beds because of the lower pressure drop and energy required, while CO₂ adsorption capacity is maintained. Nonetheless, commercially available monoliths have not been optimised for DAC applications. For instance, geometry could be optimised for heat and mass transfer, sorbent lifetime, and to minimise sorbent amounts required. In addition, current sorbent\-based DAC processes operate in batch\-wise mode. Continuous operation is often regarded as the most productive configuration in the process industry, and it presents technical advantages over cyclic DAC operation. Therefore, in this project, we will design, fabricate, test and model monolith structures for continuous DAC operation. The steps towards this include:
   

  

* Designing a range of monolith geometries for DAC application and setting up multiphysics (coupled flow, heat, and mass transfer) simulations of these geometries.
* Interpreting numerical results to select the most promising geometries.
* Fabricating monolith samples using advanced additive manufacturing techniques and functionalising them through impregnation or grafting.
* Constructing a test set\-up for breakthrough testing of these samples.
* Validating simulations using experimental results, and combining both to recommend optimal monolith structures for scale\-up.


 For this 2\-year project, we seek a motivated postdoc researcher with a passion for engineering and sustainability. The prospective researcher will work closely with dr.ir. Tim M.J. Nijssen. Furthermore, we will meet regularly with Skytree BV to ensure alignment between this numerical project and their experimental campaign. You will be welcomed in the Engineering Thermodynamics section within the department of Process \& Energy. Our section is focussed on the complex interplay between thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer and chemistry found in process equipment, and aim to understand these phenomena to design materials, devices and processes for a sustainable economy.
   

  

**Job Requirements**
 We seek a motivated, conscientious researcher (x/f/m) with strong communication and self\-management skills, who is passionate about contributing to a solution for climate change.
   

  

**The Successful Candidate**
* Holds (or is soon to obtain) a doctorate degree in mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, or a similar field.
* Has experience in (multiphysics) CFD simulatinos (e.g. in OpenFOAM, COMSOL, etc.).
* Has experience in material preparation and testing (e.g. in adsorption, absorption, membranes, catalysis, etc.).

----------------


Retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG) has become more and more popular due to its potential to achieve comparable performance with smaller models compared with large LLM modes. In the RAG architecture, the knowledge is embedded and stored in external vector databases for retrieval of relevant knowledge by the LLMs instead of the model weights during training. To process a user query, the RAG framework first retrieves relevant knowledge from the vector database, and this knowledge is fed to the generator (an LLM) as external knowledge to generate the final answer. Advanced RAG frameworks retrieve the knowledge from the vector database multiple times during the generation. Thus, the vector database plays an important role in the end\-to\-end performance of RAG such as accuracy and latency. However, RAG also brings new challenges to vector databases as the ever\-increasing size of datasets cannot fit into the main memory and thus needs to be offloaded to SSDs.  

  

The aim of this exploratory project is to understand what roles VectorDB plays in the performance of overall RAG pipelines, and how modern fast storage help accelerate the performance of VectorDBs.

**Your duties**


* Building programs that investigates the differences in latency, throughput, and scalability of different vector database and indexing algorithms.
* Investigating how the performance of vector databases affect the end\-to\-end performance of RAG.
* Help with building the next generation of vector databases for the RAG workloads.

* Experience with Linux
* Experience with database systems, large language models, and RAG is preferred but not mandatory
* Experience with ML frameworks such as PyTorch is preferred but not mandatory

 Jouw functie
   

  

 Retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG) has become more and more popular due to its potential to achieve comparable performance with smaller models compared with large LLM modes. In the RAG architecture, the knowledge is embedded and stored in external vector databases for retrieval of relevant knowledge by the LLMs instead of the model weights during training. To process a user query, the RAG framework first retrieves relevant knowledge from the vector database, and this knowledge is fed to the generator (an LLM) as external knowledge to generate the final answer. Advanced RAG frameworks retrieve the knowledge from the vector database multiple times during the generation. Thus, the vector database plays an important role in the end\-to\-end performance of RAG such as accuracy and latency. However, RAG also brings new challenges to vector databases as the ever\-increasing size of datasets cannot fit into the main memory and thus needs to be offloaded to SSDs.
   

  

 The aim of this exploratory project is to understand what roles VectorDB plays in the performance of overall RAG pipelines, and how modern fast storage help accelerate the performance of VectorDBs.
 
**Your duties**
* Building programs that investigates the differences in latency, throughput, and scalability of different vector database and indexing algorithms.
* Investigating how the performance of vector databases affect the end\-to\-end performance of RAG.
* Help with building the next generation of vector databases for the RAG workloads.

 Your function
   

  

 Retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG) has become more and more popular due to its potential to achieve comparable performance with smaller models compared with large LLM modes. In the RAG architecture, the knowledge is embedded and stored in external vector databases for retrieval of relevant knowledge by the LLMs instead of the model weights during training. To process a user query, the RAG framework first retrieves relevant knowledge from the vector database, and this knowledge is fed to the generator (an LLM) as external knowledge to generate the final answer. Advanced RAG frameworks retrieve the knowledge from the vector database multiple times during the generation. Thus, the vector database plays an important role in the end\-to\-end performance of RAG such as accuracy and latency. However, RAG also brings new challenges to vector databases as the ever\-increasing size of datasets cannot fit into the main memory and thus needs to be offloaded to SSDs.
   

  

 The aim of this exploratory project is to understand what roles VectorDB plays in the performance of overall RAG pipelines, and how modern fast storage help accelerate the performance of VectorDBs.
 
**Your duties**
* Building programs that investigates the differences in latency, throughput, and scalability of different vector database and indexing algorithms.
* Investigating how the performance of vector databases affect the end\-to\-end performance of RAG.
* Help with building the next generation of vector databases for the RAG workloads.

Smart lighting goes far beyond simply switching lights on and off. We leverage the wireless mesh networks we create to control lighting as a backbone for making buildings smarter. This enables use cases such as tracking medical equipment, people counting, climate monitoring, and more.
 


* Our solution excels in the strength of our wireless mesh network, which is far more scalable and robust than any of our competitors. This enables us to cover cases and buildings that no one else can, such as explosion\-proof environments (refineries, mines), container ships, and similar challenging locations. We achieve this in collaboration with our wireless partner
 **Wirepas** 
 , which provides industry\-leading IoT technology.



 The future of our solution is bright. Industry giants like
 **ABB, Siemens, and Schneider Electric** 
 have announced plans to develop a new standard for wireless smart buildings using the same Wirepas technology that we use. This puts us in a leading global position to provide lighting control within this new standard.
 



  





 Our solution is deployed worldwide through partners such as Trilux, Royal BAM, Equans, and Schneider Electric, operating in countries including the U.S., Australia, South Korea, Brazil, France, the UK, and many more. Despite our global reach and collaboration with multi\-billion\-dollar clients, we remain a small, agile team (currently 15 people). We maintain short lines of communication and a fast\-paced, startup mentality. Expect to work closely with customers, see your code deployed on large\-scale sites rapidly, and make meaningful contributions to advancing our product. This is not the place for someone looking to hide in a corner and simply tick off tasks!
 



  





**You Role \& Responsibilities** 




 Ingy provides firmware to dozens of hardware partners in China, Europe, and the U.S., each manufacturing hundreds of different devices with various sensor technologies (PIR, microwave, camera), communication protocols (relay, DALI, 0\-10V), and beyond\-lighting capabilities (people counting, climate monitoring, asset tracking, indoor navigation). Ingy has deployed numerous large\-scale projects in warehouses, logistics centers, and office buildings, involving thousands of devices. These require large\-scale networks, high uptime, robust update processes, and—above all—high\-quality embedded software.
 



  





**Example of Projects You'll Be Working On** 



* Developing a distributed time\-scheduling mechanism that is resilient to power outages, including planned downtime over weekends or holidays.
* Creating a distributed record\-based system to store global and third\-party device configuration data within the network itself, ensuring robustness against node failures and replacements.
* Enhancing commissioning speed using advanced techniques such as augmented reality, autonomous robots, computer vision, and smart constraint satisfaction algorithms on RSSI graphs across wireless nodes.
* Strengthening our security protocols, including secure network joining and utilizing embedded secure elements in partner hardware.



  





**About the Team** 




 Ingy is a fast\-paced startup transitioning into a scale\-up. We have built a highly skilled, ambitious team with expertise across front\-end, cloud, gateways, and firmware. While everyone has at least one specialization, we value flexibility and encourage team members to expand their skills into at least one or two additional areas.
 



 We foster a culture of continuous learning and support personal growth. There are no rigid career steps—you can grow as quickly and in whatever direction suits you best, whether it's deep algorithmic coding, architecture, customer interaction, project management, Scrum mastery, or product management.
 



 Collaboration is key. All code is peer\-reviewed, and we see this as an opportunity to become better engineers every day. You are expected to actively contribute to the growth of your colleagues whenever possible.
 



 We also embrace innovation and strongly encourage you to explore and apply the latest LLM tools to enhance productivity and code quality.
 



 Our team is heavily technology\-focused—expect lunchtime discussions on everything from Minecraft to the validity of the Chinese Room Argument. And yes,
 *42* 
 is always a good answer.
 



  





**Your Skills \& Qualifications** 




 We are hiring for a junior position (0\-3 years of experience). While we welcome candidates with a broad skill set and diverse interests, you must have embedded programming experience. This could come from your education, graduation project, or personal work, but it must be real embedded programming—not just writing C in a non\-embedded setting.
 



  





**Must\-Have Skills** 




 Strong understanding of embedded system limitations, including:
 


* Optimizing for size and memory usage
* Debugging embedded systems
* Understanding compilers and linkers
* Mitigating flash wear
* Hardware peripherals, TIMERs, ADC, PWM, PPI
* Familiarity with hardware devices, especially Nordic Semiconductor and Silicon Labs chips
* Knowledge of wireless systems, including protocols, OTA updates, and distributed sensor networks
* Understanding of authentication, authorization, encryption schemes, and licensing methods



  





**Bonus Skills (Highly Valued)** 



* Experience with React, AWS, Docker, Python
* Personal IoT projects or an active GitHub portfolio



  





**Reasons NOT to apply (or do a test)** 




 Only apply when:
 


* You actually have experience with embedded firmware on the level of connecting hardware peripherals with PPI.
* You are physically located right now in the Netherlands.
* You are allowed to work in the Netherlands indefinitely (no temporary work visa).
* You are aware of the salary brackets and it matches your salary expectations.

**About The Role**
 We're pioneering the future of sales with our GTM Engineering team—reimagining traditional sales roles by collapsing SDRs, AEs, and sales engineers into a single, high\-leverage function. As a GTM Engineer at Lleverage.ai, you'll design and build scalable revenue\-generating systems rather than simply executing manual outreach.
   

  

 Unlike traditional sales roles where individual effort determines success, you'll create automated workflows that can reach thousands of prospects without adding headcount—similar to how engineering teams build software that serves millions without requiring more engineers.
   

  

**Why Lleverage?**
* Change the world, literally: 2025 is the year AI works, and Lleverage.ai is at the forefront of making AI accessible and valuable for businesses
* Work, learn, have fun: You'll be part of a technical sales team that thinks and operates like product builders
* Build a unique network: Connect with decision\-makers and technical leaders across industries as you help them implement AI solutions
* Get autonomy \& ownership: Build and own entire revenue\-generating systems rather than just hitting call quotas
* Compensation: We pay top of market cash and equity, with compensation tied to the value you create, not just activities you perform


**Responsibilities**
* Design Revenue Systems: Create scalable, automated systems for prospect research, personalized outreach, and lead qualification
* Generate Pipeline: Build processes that drive demand at 10x the scale of traditional SDR teams
* Close Deals: Take ownership of the entire sales cycle from initial contact to closed deal
* Technical Consultation: Provide expert product guidance and help prospects understand how to transform their own operations with AI
* Build Automation: Leverage our platform, LLMs, and other tools to automate personalized outreach at scale
* Measure \& Optimize: Continuously improve your systems based on data and results
* Product Feedback: Share insights from customer interactions to help shape our product roadmap
* Technical Workshopping: Help customers implement and get maximum value from our platform


**Job Specific Requirements**
* Systems Thinking: Ability to design scalable processes rather than just executing manual tasks
* Technical Curiosity: Comfortable learning and using new tools to automate sales processes
* Sales Acumen: Strong interpersonal skills and ability to guide prospects through complex buying decisions
* Product Understanding: Capacity to quickly develop deep product knowledge and explain technical concepts clearly
* Data\-Driven: Experience using data to measure results and optimize processes
* High Agency: Self\-starter who can identify problems and implement solutions independently
* Automation Experience: Background working with sales or marketing automation tools
* Communication Skills: Excellent written and verbal communication for both technical and non\-technical audiences


**Nice to haves**
* Experience using or building with AI/LLM tools for sales or marketing
* Background in a technical or product role with customer\-facing responsibilities
* Experience with CRM customization, data enrichment tools, or sales automation platforms
* Understanding of data pipelines and how to structure data for sales intelligence
* Previous experience in a hybrid commercial/technical role
* A carry\-on ice cream bar (it's becoming our thing)


**Our approach to GTM engineering**
 Our GTM Engineers combine three traditional roles:
   

  

* Generate pipeline through automated systems (traditionally SDR work)
* Close existing pipeline through consultative selling (traditionally AE work)
* Technical workshopping to help customers implement solutions (traditionally Sales Engineer work)


 This creates tighter feedback loops, better customer experiences, and more valuable product insights—all while achieving more efficient revenue growth.

1. **Apply:** 

 Apply here or email your CV \& GitHub link to suraj@woub.chat
2. **Introduction (call or video):** 

 We call or video call to see if we click
3. **1st Interview:** 

 You talk to our tech leads and stakeholders. We dive a little deeper into the content – about your experience, our tech, and how you like to work.
4. **Case/Assignment:** 

 Are we both enthusiastic? Then you will get a small case or assignment to show how you think, build, and make choices. We keep it relevant and realistic.

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

We see this way of working as a perfect fit to maintain and increase engagement with customers, the organization, and team members. As a team, we set clear goals and results, giving the development team the freedom to decide how best to achieve them.


What will you be doing?

* Utilize big data technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and NoSQL databases to manage and analyze large datasets.
* Collaborate with a scrum team to achieve project goals and meet OKRs, employing agile methodologies and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.
* Serve as the sole expert on AI/ML within the team, demonstrating a high level of self\-reliance and autonomy in decision\-making.
* Educate and mentor other developers on AI/ML concepts and techniques, including neural networks, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP).
* Communicate complex AI/ML concepts to stakeholders in simple and understandable terms, ensuring alignment with business objectives and technical feasibility.

What are we offering:


* Projects that truly impact people and society.
* A meaningful career with learning and development opportunities.
* A good salary, a year\-end bonus, and a personal choice budget.
* 28 vacation days, with the possibility to buy or sell leave days.

**Qualifications:**


* Proven experience in AI and Machine Learning, with expertise in algorithms such as regression, classification, clustering, and reinforcement learning.

* Proficiency in programming languages such as Python and SQL, as well as frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit\-learn.
* A good command of the English language in both spoken and written forms. Proficiency in Dutch is valued.
* It is not mandatory, but a plus when you have experience in / knowledge of version control tools (GIT is preferred), geographic information systems (GIS), and tools like FME, ArcGIS en QGIS.

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:

Furthermore, with some own initiative and a good portion of curiosity, you are able to continue your career at Thales at a completely different department.

Join our team developing cutting\-edge models that formalise the connection between musical works in training data, generative music models, and their outputs.
   

  

 Join our research team!
   

  

 We want you to reimagine the future of creative AI attribution rather than just looking for ‘plagiarism’. Your research will help establish ethical frameworks for AI music creation that balance the interests of artists, the creative industries, and technological advancement. You will be collaborating with an interdisciplinary team of musicologists, legal scholars, and labour\-market specialists on the project ‘Fair Remuneration in Times of Generative AI: A Reality Check for the Dutch Music Sector’. In partnership with industry\-leading rights organisations, our goal at the end of the project is to recommend concrete policies for remunerating Dutch artists and rightsholders for the use of their music in AI training.
   

  

 This is what you will do
   

  

 Your work within this project will assess the extent to which current AI models incorporate specific copyrighted works and pioneer new methods for examining how traces of the training data appear within music embeddings and are regenerated in AI compositions. We are looking to quantify the influence of training examples on AI music compositions and use cutting\-edge explainable AI techniques to analysing their encoding paths within the ‘brain’ of generative AI systems. During your contract, you will produce a prototype assessment model for artist remuneration based on diagnostic classifiers, which we will release as open\-source software in tandem with a high\-impact journal or conference paper.
   

  

 Overall, we are striving to balance two competing societal objectives: fair remuneration of artists for using their work in training AI models that may potentially replace them at lower cost vs. ensuring that AI models are able to be trained on a sufficiently rich corpus of source material that artists will also benefit from revolutionary new tools that can support or even enhance their creativity.
   

  

 Your tasks will be:
   

  

* design and conduct research under the guidance of the project leader, resulting in at least one peer\-reviewed academic publication in international scientific conferences or journals;
* develop statistical models for assessing the relative contribution of training materials to generative music models and outputs;
* co\-organise expert meetings or symposia involving industrial and legal partners in the field; and
* contribute collaboratively to the software infrastructure of the Amsterdam Music Lab.


 This is what we ask of you
   

  

* a PhD in artificial intelligence, machine learning, audio signal processing, music technology, or a related field (although candidates with a related master's degree and relevant industrial experience can also be considered);
* demonstrable experience working with recent AI models for music or audio generation;
* experience presenting scientific results at international conferences or publishing in leading international scientific journals;
* a strong cooperative attitude and willingness to engage in collaborative research;
* enthusiasm for communicating academic research to non\-academic audiences;
* excellent social, communication, and organisational skills; and
* excellent command of written and spoken English.


 This is what we offer you
   

  

* a 12\-month researcher 4 (postdoc) contract starting 1 June 2025, with a probation period of 2 months;
* technical support from scientific programmers;
* excellent possibilities for further professional development and education;
* an enthusiastic and professional academic team;
* an inspiring academic and international work environment in the heart of Amsterdam; and
* the opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers and partners in the music industry.

----------------------------

***For this role we do not need to recruit abroad.***


The Senior Data Scientist at Odido develops and applies predictive models that have an impact on commercial performance and customer\-related processes. You are a real specialist. Important here is your deep knowledge of both data science and telecom. Ideally, you already have knowledge on designing human\-like interactions enabling direct customer interaction on multiple channels. Most of the time you will be working on Natural Language Processing (chatbot and voice\-bot), using generative models to help business partners to work more efficiently or help customers find their answers.


The role would be focused on scaling up and expanding the current initiatives using the latest Generative AI models. We use the models to help our colleagues internally to efficiently do their work. For instance, by creating RAG models to support our customer support agents. You would also be working on setting the techniques up to support customers directly with questions they are having.


Furthermore, you will be working with multi\-departmental teams where you have to be fully competent in different areas by showing business value through POCs and converting them into production\-worthy systems together with data engineers. Also, for explaining complex information to others, communication, tact and diplomacy skills are needed. You will be working very close to direct customer feedback. In this role you can help us to become a truly data\-driven organization. Working within an informal atmosphere where you have a lot of freedom to work as the data scientist you want to be. How good is that!


*Depending on your ambitions, there is also room to grow into a more product\-oriented role. In time, you may take partial ownership of the AI roadmap alongside our Product Lead AI Platform – bringing your technical perspective into strategic planning while remaining deeply rooted in hands\-on data science work (roughly 70/30 split).*


**With whom will you work?**


The Senior Data Scientist will be in the Data Science team, which is a part of the Information Technology department (IT). We have a diverse team with people from 4 continents! You will work with non\-technical customers and technical colleagues. The departments where you will be working with are the end\-users of the models (B2C, B2B, Finance or Technology). From the very beginning our models and processes are designed to go to production. You will see your models in action!


**Together we are**
-------------------


We are Odido, the new provider of mobile, fiber optic and TV. And with almost 2,000 colleagues, we show that telecom can be improved. Because technology is for everyone. Wherever you come from, wherever you go. With Odido everyone participates in the digital world. That is our ambition. Everyone at Odido helps to build a brand that is human, optimistic and progressive.


Is that really something for you? Then we might fit well together.


**This is what we stand for**
-----------------------------


Our name \- you can also read it from back to front \- consists of different shapes. Which together are one. Because that's how we look at the world around us. As a place where people, no matter how different, move forward together. We're there for each other. We always look at opportunities. We celebrate diversity and are committed to an inclusive work environment with equal opportunities for all. That sounds good of course. But we don't stop at fine words: at Odido we are a recognized Top Employer. A confirmation that we are proud of.


**What we offer**
-----------------

* Good salary and variable bonus scheme;
* Hybrid working;
* A progressive pension scheme;
* 30 vacation days (if you work for us full\-time) and an extra day off after Ascension Day;
* Redeemable holidays;
* An Odido subscription;
* Real growth opportunities;
* Personal annual learning budget and over 200 digital training and courses;
* Workshops, learning weeks, annual ski trip, fun outings and parties.


**You bring this**
------------------


Some things you cannot learn in a book or school, but you possess them by nature. Your core personality is empathic, decisive, humorous, people\-focused, authentic, and honest. You know the difference between managing and coaching and understand when to apply which. You embrace challenges and are eager to grow. These are traits we are looking for not only in managerial positions but in every member at every level of Odido!


* Master (WO) degree in AI, Machine Learning, Data Science
* Deep knowledge of AI/ML, 3\-6 years’ experience as (Senior) Data Scientist and preferably experience in telecom
* Knowledge of GenAI: LLM (essential) and text2image (nice2have)

* Know how to work with different algorithms (from deep learning, regression, decision trees, gradient boosting, reinforcement learning).

 We serve 100% of MBB/Big\-4 advisories, clients representing \>$500bn of private equity capital and more than 70% of the top\-20 global M\&A houses. Examples include Blackstone, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey. We lead the market on customer satisfaction, as validated by external research (User Evidence survey 2023\).

**Our team**
 Our engineering team is based in Amsterdam, where most of us typically work 2 days a week onsite. We are a lean team of 14 senior engineers (backend \& frontend, data, DevOps, ML) and 5 colleagues in product and design. Together, we operate efficiently and pragmatically, and everyone’s voice is heard. We are rapidly scaling, so as an early joiner of our ML team, there is plenty of room to have a big impact and set directions. Apart from a short daily stand\-up, we keep meetings to a minimum (think max 1\-2 per week). We do a monthly team event on Tuesday evenings that you are welcome to join.
   

  

**Your Experience And Skills**
* \>3 years of professional experience developing ML models to solve real\-world business problems
* Proficiency in Python and common ML libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy)
* Experience working with LLMs, including prompt engineering, evaluation, and RAG systems
* Strong SQL skills; experience with PostgreSQL or similar databases
* Comfortable working in cloud environments (we use GCP) and with containerization tools (e.g., Docker)
* You have a relentless focus on business value
* You recognize when a third\-party API does the trick


**Bonus if you have**
* MLOps experience, e.g. MLflow or Weights \& Biases
* Experience with vector databases and search
* Experience with user sequence data for model development
* Knowledge of finance \& private markets, i.e. private equity and venture capital


**What We Offer**
* Working with excellent colleagues on a product that is loved by its customers
* Flexibility and freedom
* Modern stack

 *spatial computing* 
 om simulaties te verrijken, óf het implementeren van RAG om virtuele assistenten nog slimmer te maken, kunnen behoren tot jouw domein.
 



 Je doel is om complexe AI\-vraagstukken op te lossen en reeds bestaande materie, continue te verbeteren. Zo’n vraagstuk kan in één van onze eigen kennisprojecten zitten of een “concrete” vraag zijn vanuit onze externe stakeholders. In samenspraak met je team geef je invulling aan hoe je die kennis gaat aanvullen én hoe je die gaat toepassen.
 



  





 Een greep uit jouw werkzaamheden:
 


* Je onderzoekt met welke AI je specifieke problemen op kunt lossen en adviseert hierover;
* Je helpt mee om de behoeften van onze eindgebruikers en andere stakeholders scherp te krijgen en deze te vertalen naar geïntegreerde, implementeerbare en effectieve oplossingen;
* Je voert inhoudelijke projecttaken uit, draagt bij aan technologische ontwikkelingen, en zorgt ervoor dat kennis en prototypes worden geleverd aan onze stakeholders.



  





 Hoe kun je bijvoorbeeld AI inzetten om de trainingsbehoefte van piloten of luchtverkeersleiders te voorspellen en vorm te geven?
 



 Zomaar een vraagstuk/ project waar jij je Als R\&D Engineer Artificial Intelligence (AI) over kunt buigen. Hierbij zet jij jouw expertise in bij het onderzoek en de ontwikkeling van bijvoorbeeld training en/of tools, gericht op het verbeteren van menselijke prestaties bij het gebruik van complexe systemen.
 



 Als R\&D Engineer Artificial Intelligence (AI) bij het NLR, werk je voornamelijk samen in projectteams met zeer getalenteerde collega's. Samen onderzoek, ontwikkel en evalueer je interactieve systemen zoals trainingssimulatoren en operationele tools. Jouw rol hierin varieert. De ene keer draag je bij aan een paper. Een andere keer ben je als expert betrokken en geef je advies. Maar ook de verantwoordelijkheid dragen van begin tot eind kan voorkomen (afhankelijk van jouw vakvolwassenheid).
 



  





 Het werk dat je doet in dit groeiende domein is zeer gevarieerd, wat ruimte en vrijheid geeft om jezelf te ontwikkelen op een manier die bij jou past. Afhankelijk van het vraagstuk kan jouw “eindproduct” een rapport, proof of concept, demonstrator of prototype zijn.
 



 Kortom een unieke kans om continu bezig te zijn met onderzoek, toepassing en beheersing van cutting\-edge AI\-technologieën.
 



  




* Je hebt een afgeronde WO\-opleiding in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Computer Science of een vergelijkbare technische studie waarin AI een belangrijke rol speelt;
* Na je studie heb je minimaal 2 jaar werkervaring opgedaan op het gebied van AI, machine learning en/ of data science;
* Je hebt aantoonbaar kennis opgedaan van foundation models en ervaring met het toepassen daarvan in (praktische) projecten;
* Je hebt kennis van softwareontwikkeling en best practices, zowel wat betreft processen als tooling;
* Je beschikt over uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden in zowel Nederlands als Engels.



  





 Je hebt een streepje voor als je al kennis en ervaring hebt met Python, C\# en Java. Zo heb je voldoende programmeervaardigheden om deze kennis te implementeren, data te bewerken, te analyseren en inzichtelijk te presenteren.
 



  





 Je bent uitermate nieuwsgierig en gretig in het opdoen van kennis over de nieuwste AI\-toepassingen en \-technieken. Je spart hierover graag samen met collega’s om de relevantie en potentie ervan te beoordelen om vervolgens nieuwe ontwikkelingen en methodes te onderzoeken en toe te passen. Je bent creatief en adapteert snel nieuwe technieken, en weet dit ook om te zetten in een tastbaar resultaat.
 



  





 Je bent vooral iemand die in kansen denkt en gedreven is om bij te dragen aan de oplossing. Je zult veelal in teams werken, maar hebt wel de nodige zelfsturing en initiatief in huis om ook zelf een koers te bepalen. Je bent tevens bereid om je te verdiepen in (militaire) luchtvaartoperaties.
 



  





**Wat bieden wij jou?** 




 Werken bij NLR betekent werken in een internationale hightech omgeving. Samenwerken en betrokkenheid staan bij ons hoog in vaandel. Door jou vrijheid en eigen verantwoordelijkheid te geven, ben jij in staat om het beste uit je zelf te halen.
 



 Tijdens een ruime inwerkperiode krijg je de tijd om een goed beeld te vormen van wat we allemaal doen en een eigen ontwikkelplan af te stemmen om vervolgens aan de slag te gaan met projecten binnen jouw interessegebied.
 



 Wil jij jezelf vakinhoudelijk én op persoonlijk vlak ontwikkelen? Ook dat kan bij NLR als lerende organisatie, met een opleidingsbudget, een mentor, interne coaches en goede contacten met mbo's, hbo's en universiteiten.

 This is what you will do
   

  

***For this role we do not need to recruit abroad.***
 The Senior Data Scientist at Odido develops and applies predictive models that have an impact on commercial performance and customer\-related processes. You are a real specialist. Important here is your deep knowledge of both data science and telecom. Ideally, you already have knowledge on designing human\-like interactions enabling direct customer interaction on multiple channels. Most of the time you will be working on Natural Language Processing (chatbot and voice\-bot), using generative models to help business partners to work more efficiently or help customers find their answers.
   

  

 The role would be focused on scaling up and expanding the current initiatives using the latest Generative AI models. We use the models to help our colleagues internally to efficiently do their work. For instance, by creating RAG models to support our customer support agents. You would also be working on setting the techniques up to support customers directly with questions they are having.
   

  

 Furthermore, you will be working with multi\-departmental teams where you have to be fully competent in different areas by showing business value through POCs and converting them into production\-worthy systems together with data engineers. Also, for explaining complex information to others, communication, tact and diplomacy skills are needed. You will be working very close to direct customer feedback. In this role you can help us to become a truly data\-driven organization. Working within an informal atmosphere where you have a lot of freedom to work as the data scientist you want to be. How good is that!
   

  

*Depending on your ambitions, there is also room to grow into a more product\-oriented role. In time, you may take partial ownership of the AI roadmap alongside our Product Lead AI Platform \- bringing your technical perspective into strategic planning while remaining deeply rooted in hands\-on data science work (roughly 70/30 split).*
**With whom will you work?**
 The Senior Data Scientist will be in the Data Science team, which is a part of the Information Technology department (IT). We have a diverse team with people from 4 continents! You will work with non\-technical customers and technical colleagues. The departments where you will be working with are the end\-users of the models (B2C, B2B, Finance or Technology). From the very beginning our models and processes are designed to go to production. You will see your models in action!

 Als Junior BI Consultant bij Solviteers krijg je de kans om zowel expertise op te bouwen in Business Intelligence als kennis op te doen van de bronapplicaties binnen de overheidssector. Dit biedt een unieke combinatie die snel veel kennis en ervaring oplevert en een sterke positie in de markt mogelijk maakt. De aanwezigheid van ervaren collega’s stimuleert jouw ontwikkeling, net als de complexiteit en uitdagingen tijdens opdrachten. Dagelijks sta je voor complexe puzzels en geniet je van de variatie en uitdaging die de opdrachten bieden, waardoor je voortdurend wordt uitgedaagd en gemotiveerd.
   

  

 Als Junior BI Consultant analyseer je in eerste instantie de informatiebehoefte van de klant en ontwikkel je rapporten en dashboards. Je kunt je specialiseren in het maken van managementinformatie voor diverse bronapplicaties of nieuwe technieken toepassen. Verder kun je je verdiepen in datawarehousing als BI data engineer, een BI\-architectuur ontwikkelen als data architect of voorspellingsmodellen maken als data scientist. Ten slotte kun je een adviserende rol aannemen om klanten te helpen bij het bepalen van hun managementinformatiebehoeften.
   

  

 Er zijn vijf hoofdrollen binnen BI, hoewel titels kunnen variëren. Vaak overlappen deze rollen, wat betekent dat je tijdens een opdracht elementen van meerdere rollen kunt tegenkomen.
   

  

 In de basis vraag je bij de klant de behoefte naar managementinformatie uit en vertaal je deze naar een rapport of dashboard. Als BI Consultant richt je je op het ontwikkelen van het rapport of dashboard met de beschikbare BI\-tool, terwijl je als Data Engineer meer bezig bent met de techniek achter het beschikbaar stellen van de data (en meestal) in de vorm van een datawarehouse.
   

  

**Waar kom je te werken?**
 Bij Solviteers werk je samen met een team van deskundige collega's om complexe IT\-vraagstukken aan te pakken. Jouw bijdrage gaat verder dan waarde leveren aan klanten; het draagt direct bij aan positieve maatschappelijke impact. Binnen Solviteers staat professionele groei centraal, maar ook het plezier in samenwerken. Zo kan je naast goed samenwerken met professionals, ook op vrijwillige basis aansluiten bij leuke uitjes die georganiseerd worden door onze personeelsvereniging.
   

  

 Bij Solviteers zijn we ervan overtuigd dat je kunt blijven groeien. In onze op maat gemaakte ontwikkeltrajecten focus je op zowel persoonlijke\- als professionele groei. Met specifieke ontwikkelpaden voor elke functie, afgestemd op jouw sterke punten en ambities. Wij bieden trajecten aan waarin je werkt aan het versterken van hard skills, soft skills en praktijkervaring. Bij ons staat jouw groei centraal.
   

  

**Wat wij vragen?**
 Om succesvol te zijn in deze rol is het belangrijk dat je analytische vaardigheden bezit en creatief bent in het bedenken van oplossingen. Jouw communicatieve vaardigheden en resultaatgerichtheid zorgen er daarnaast voor je dat je nieuwe concepten snel kunt oppakken, goed met stakeholders kan schakelen en flexibel bent in veranderende omstandigheden.
   

  

**Wat je verder meeneemt**
* Je hebt een hbo\-/wo diploma, bij voorkeur op het gebied van BI of ICT;
* Je hebt ervaring met BI\-tools (Cognos of Power\-BI);
* Je hebt ervaring met SQL (Oracle of SQL\-server);
* Je hebt ervaring met methodieken zoals Scrum en Agile en hebt affiniteit met het inzichtelijk maken van data.


**Wat we nog meer graag zouden zien, maar wat je ook bij ons kunt leren:**
* Je hebt bij voorkeur kennis van datawarehouse concepten en architecturen zoals Stermodelleren, Kimball en/of Data Vault;
* Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring met het ontwikkelen van datawarehouses (Oracle of Azure);
* Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring in de (lokale) overheid.


**Wat wij bieden?**
* Een vast salaris tussen de €3\.300 en €4\.000
* Winstuitkering en pensioenregeling
* Maatwerk ontwikkelprogramma
* 12 ontwikkeldagen en 12 kennisdelingsdagen met collega’s

 You will be based in one of our European offices as part of our Operations Practice.
   

  

 Our Operations Practice assists our clients in solving complex operational challenges. Blending strategic thinking with hands\-on practicality, our teams of consultants and experts work to develop and implement operational strategies that solve our clients’ most pressing problems.
   

  

 McKinsey’s Service Operations service line is part of our Operations Practice. It helps clients create and execute service strategies that lead to competitive advantage, an improved customer experience, higher effectiveness and quality of work, and measurable bottom\-line impact.
   

  

 The service areas we work in range from end\-customer services (e.g., call centers and field services) to internal back\-office operations (e.g., in IT, HR, and Finance). In each of these areas, we help our clients enhance their productivity and set them up for the future, which, in many cases, leads to the longer\-term transformation of the operating model (including structures, processes, technology, and people).
   

  

 When you join McKinsey as a Consultant, you join a firm that will challenge you and invest heavily in your professional development. You will have the opportunity to work in dynamic teams and help leading global organizations solve some of their most challenging and complex problems.
   

  

**Your Impact**
 You will play an active role in problem\-solving for clients, including identifying issues, forming hypotheses, designing and conducting analyses, and synthesizing conclusions into recommendations.
   

  

 You will shape clients’ digital agendas and lead them toward next\-generation operational models—digitally transforming end\-to\-end journeys using advanced analytics, intelligent automation, GenAI, and agile methodologies in service\-oriented industries. Additionally, you will assist our client teams in developing strategies and technology roadmaps for implementing processes and operating systems that support applications connected to digital service operations.
   

  

 As part of your role, you will help clients imagine and implement the future of service delivery—where AI, GenAI, and agentic technologies are reshaping how services are designed, delivered, and scaled.
   

  

 You will work with cross\-functional teams to explore AI\-native operating models, integrate intelligent agents into service ecosystems, and help client’s future\-proof their service strategies by embedding emerging technologies across front\- and back\-office operations.
   

  

 While hands\-on experience in these areas is a plus, what matters most is your ability to think ahead, connect technology to business outcomes, and inspire bold change.
   

  

 You will also gain new skills and build on the strengths you bring to the firm. You will receive exceptional training, frequent coaching, and ongoing mentoring from colleagues and senior leaders on your teams.
   

  

 As part of our two\-year Operations Excellence Program (OEP), you will work on client engagements in the same way as any other McKinsey consultant. You will gain leading edge operations and consultancy skills, primarily through on\-the\-job coaching, which will be complemented by the OEP’s structured capability\-building program.
   

  

 We view the OEP position as the start of a rewarding, challenging and highly flexible career with McKinsey and the Operations practice. During your first few years with the firm, you will serve as a junior practice specialist on multiple client engagements and work with a number of colleagues and clients in a range of industry and operations service lines. You will acquire the necessary knowledge and expertise to help companies achieve excellence in their operations.
   

  

 Along with other members of the OEP community, you will dedicate many days to functional training and knowledge development under the leadership of our operations experts. You will follow a curriculum based on operations excellence themes and will receive advanced training in one of six specific areas of operations manufacturing, product development, purchasing, service operations, supply chain management, or capital excellence.
   

  

 Upon completion of the program, successful consultants will join our global group of leading experts in operational excellence. We already have OEP graduates working at all levels of the firm from associate to partner.
   

  

 Your application should be in English and include your CV and your transcripts (high school, university, etc.), indicating all relevant grades.

The project focuses on the development of methodologies for multilingual NLP and alignment of large language models (LLMs).
   

  

 Join Us!
   

  

 In the last two years, LLMs found wide adoption in many areas of societal life. Their development, however, requires access to a vast amount of data and resources in a given language, as well as considerable computational infrastructure. As a result, these models are in practice limited to a handful of widely\-spoken languages, leaving over 6,000 of the world's languages and dialects without access to language technology. Furthermore, research on LLM alignment, which aims to ensure the safety of their use, has been almost exclusively directed toward the English\-speaking world. Taken together, these problems lead to a major inequity in today's language technology and artificial intelligence more broadly.
   

  

 In this project, we will develop a new methodology for cross\-lingual transfer of LLMs to a wide\-range of (low\-resource, understudied) languages and dialects, and their alignment to diverse cultural contexts. In particular, we will explore techniques from the areas of few\-shot learning, continual learning and modular deep learning, as well as different LLM alignment frameworks, based on reinforcement learning and direct preference optimisation, extending them to perform pluralistic alignment. To enhance model interpretability, we will also develop methods to better understand the mechanisms of cross\-lingual transfer in LLMs and their cultural awareness.
   

  

 We welcome applications from recent MSc graduates in relevant areas, such as artificial intelligence and natural language processing. An ideal candidate will have a strong technical background in natural language processing or machine learning, but also a keen interest in language and society. You will become a member of the thriving and friendly Amsterdam NLU Lab.
   

  

 This is what you will do
   

  

 You will be expected to contribute to the project, described above, and:
   

  

* to complete and defend a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four years;
* to present research results regularly at international workshops and conferences, and to publish them in conference proceedings and journals;
* to participate in and to contribute to the organisation of research activities and events at the Institute, such as workshops and colloquia.


 All PhD candidates at the ILLC are furthermore expected to make a small contribution to the institute’s educational mission, e.g., by working as teaching assistants for courses in their area of expertise and by assisting with the supervision of student research projects.
   

  

 Your profile
   

  

* a Master’s degree in a relevant discipline, such as Natural Language Processing or Artificial Intelligence;
* technical skills and scientific interest to conduct cutting\-edge research in natural language processing and machine learning;
* an excellent academic track record;
* experience in natural language processing;
* a serious interest in pursuing fundamental research;
* ability to work with a high degree of independence and eagerness to contribute your own ideas;
* good writing and presentation skills;
* full proficiency in spoken and written English.


 Please note that knowledge of the Dutch language is not required for these positions, nor is it required for being able to live in Amsterdam. However, PhD candidates at the ILLC have the opportunity to attend Dutch language classes if they wish.
   

  

 This is what we offer you
   

  

 A temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). The preferred starting date is 1st of September 2025 .
   

  

 The gross monthly salary, based on 38 hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,901 to € 3,707 (scale P).This does not include 8% holiday allowance and 8,3% year\-end allowance.

Are you looking for a versatile role where you can develop and implement smart AI workflows that help us build a state\-of\-the\-art marketplace?**
**Who We Are**
 Have you ever experienced how difficult it can be to quickly and reliably find a local service provider, such as a painter or accountant? This is exactly why we founded Trustoo in 2019\. Trustoo is an online platform for local entrepreneurs that allows visitors to find the best businesses easily. Think of it as a Booking.com or Tripadvisor but for local companies.
   

  

 Trustoo offers some 150,000 local companies, in more than 80 industries, a platform to be easily found online. Of course, we cannot do this alone: our team consists of about 75 enthusiastic colleagues who ensure that you enjoy going to work every day \- even if only for a game of table tennis or the cozy Friday afternoon drinks.
   

  

**What makes your role crucial for Trustoo?**
**Wouter (Product Lead Data \& AI)**
*“We see huge potential to use AI for lead scoring, review generation, chat automation, call summarization, and more. But we’re not here for theoretical pilots. We want real results. That’s why we’re looking for a hands\-on builder who can quickly prototype and ship useful tools. You’ll work closely with me and our developers to make AI a natural part of our product and operations.”*
**Position**
 As an AI Solutions Specialist, you’ll work across departments to identify opportunities, build solutions, and get them live. From internal copilots and lead matching to NLP workflows or LLM\-based automations, you’ll be building smart tools that actually get used. We’re growing fast and learning every day. Most of what we build is done in\-house, which gives us the speed and flexibility to move quickly. At the same time, we stay pragmatic. If an external solution works better or gets us there faster, we’ll use it. This role helps guide those decisions. You’ll work closely with product and development to find the best mix between custom\-built and off\-the\-shelf solutions.
   

  

 In short, a broad and impactful AI role. In which you:
   

  

* Build and test AI\-driven tools and workflows using LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.), Python, APIs and lightweight frameworks
* Work closely with our Product lead AI to identify and prioritize use cases
* Connect your solutions with existing data and infrastructure in collaboration with our developers
* Run experiments, analyze results, and iterate quickly to improve performance
* Stay sharp on the latest AI developments and propose smart things to try
* Help other teams, like Sales and Customer Success, use AI tools more effectively


**What Your Day Looks Like**
 Start your day with a short check\-in, either with the product and tech team or with Wouter. What needs to be built or tested today? Are we ready to roll out that internal chatbot? Do we need to review the call summaries from last week’s experiment?
   

  

 You plan your work, with room to go deep when building or tweaking prototypes. Some days are focused on coding, others are more collaborative. You might brainstorm new use cases, check data quality, or refine prompts. With our open culture and short lines, we move fast. No long meetings or heavy processes. Just impact. We close the week together with the team. Shipped something cool? Then it’s time for drinks or a game of ping\-pong.
   

  

**We Are Looking For Someone Who**
* Has 1 to 4 years of experience working on AI or LLM\-based solutions
* Can build with Python, APIs, and tools like OpenAI, Claude, or HuggingFace
* Knows how to go from an idea to a working prototype that people use
* Enjoys working cross\-functionally and translating business needs into smart tooling
* Is pragmatic, entrepreneurial, and focused on impact
* Bonus if you have experience with vector databases, MCP, n8n or similar tools
* Bonus if you speak Dutch or German


**What We Offer**
* A fantastic atmosphere within a close\-knit and driven group of colleagues
* A direct seat at the table. You’ll help shape our AI capability from the ground up
* A good salary based on experience
* A hybrid work setup. We expect you at least 2 to 3 days per week in our Amsterdam office
* A company laptop and all the tools you need
* Travel allowance and a work\-from\-home allowance
* The freedom to work remotely for 2 weeks per year
* 25 vacation days based on 40 hours
* A good pension scheme
* A personal development allowance of 1000 EUR per year.
* Fresh lunch and healthy snacks in the office
* Fun monthly team activities, such as drinks, sports, cooking workshops, or boat trips
* An annual company incentive trip abroad if we reach our targets

 Lees dan verder, want bij Bince doe je dit elke dag!
 



  





**Wat ga je doen?** 




  





 Als BI Consultant weet jij wat er nodig is om de zorg slimmer te maken. Dit doe je door bij onze klanten om tafel te gaan zodat je precies weet waar Bince het verschil kan maken. Natuurlijk doe je dit niet alleen, met een team van BI specialisten en Data engineers ga je gerichte oplossingen voor onze klanten ontwikkelen.
 



  





 Daar houdt het natuurlijk niet op. Je blijft betrokken bij de klant en evalueert samen de resultaten en mogelijkheden als continu lerende organisatie.
 



  





 Ons eigen dataplatform BinceBase is de fundering van ons werk. Hier komt alle data in samen vanuit alle gekoppelde programma’s. Van financiën tot planning, van HR\-gegevens tot cliëntdossiers, laten wij die data spreken voor BI en AI\-toepassingen. En daar zijn wij heel trots op!

**Waar kom je te werken?** 




  





 Bince is een vooruitstrevend bedrijf dat zich elke dag inzet om de zorg slimmer te maken.

Om deze kloof te overbruggen willen wij data voor ons laten werken zodat iedereen binnen de zorg efficiënter en effectiever aan de slag kan binnen hetzelfde budget. Bince verbindt de zorg!

 Generative artificial intelligence is disrupting many domains, including communication, education, and academic research. Recently, some companies and research initiatives have proposed that generative AI could – perhaps should – be used in healthcare, both for discovering new medical technologies and for patient treatment. In terms of research, generative AI can find trends and patterns in vast quantities of medical research, synthesising data and making new medical discoveries. In terms of improving medical care, LLMs have the potential to be integrated into the doctor\-patient relationship. They can summarise consultations, and offer ongoing medical advice, and independently provide mental health services.
   

  

 Using LLMs and other kinds of generative AI in healthcare comes with serious ethical issues. The most challenging of these is privacy, but ethical issues also include: the ability of these technologies to generate misleading or unreliable information to healthcare practitioners, the emergence of “responsibility gaps” in the healthcare system, and issues of social and epistemic justice among different patients and users. Some of these ethical challenges are similar to risks in other domains, but the challenges of applying generative AI in healthcare potentially comes with distinct harms. Unreliable healthcare information can have devastating consequences, which may be magnified if the design of LLMs do not take the privacy of the highly sensitive data they deal with into account as well as issues of justice and responsibility.
   

  

 This PhD will begin by examining the key ethical challenges of privacy, reliability, justice and responsibility, showing how these ethical risks can be minimised or mitigated. This will prepare the candidate to develop a new ethical framework that outlines how generative AI can be ethically deployed in various kinds of healthcare. The candidate can either choose to focus on how generative AI can be used in medical research or how LLMs can provide new tools for doctors and patients. The candidate will also be responsible for sharing ethical insights with the other partners in the MedGPT consortium (see below for details). Additionally, an interest in analysing the use of generative AI in healthcare from the perspective of philosophy of science or intercultural philosophy would be a plus, although not a requirement.
   

  

**Funding \& Institutional Embedding**
 This PhD position is part of the
 *Medical GPT: Revolutionising Healthcare with Ethical AI* 
 project (MedGPT). The candidate will be supervised by Matthew J. Dennis (TU/e), Vlasta Sikimić (TU/e), Filippo Santoni de Sio (TU/e), and they will be hosted by Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Philosophy \& Ethics Group. The candidate will be responsible for working with other stakeholders in the MedGPT project, and will be encouraged to collaborate with other researchers in the consortium.
   

  

**Philosophy \& Ethics Group**
 TU/e’s Philosophy and Ethics (P\&E) group connects philosophy and ethics to emerging technologies and innovation. Researchers in the P\&E group primarily study innovative technologies and technology\-related problems in detail to enable empirically informed analyses that are meaningful to philosophers, researchers across disciplines, and other societal stakeholders. To do this, the group has established close interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers from groups in the TU/e School of Innovation Sciences, as well as with mechanical engineers, climate scientists, and archaeologists, among others. The group’s expertise covers a variety of philosophical sub\-disciplines, including applied ethics, normative ethics, meta\-ethics, philosophy of science and technology, and epistemology. More information about P\&E can be found here: https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research\-groups/innovation\-sciences/philosophy\-ethics
   

  

**Job Requirements**
* A master’s degree (or an equivalent university degree) in philosophy or related discipline.
* A research\-oriented and impact\-orientated attitude.
* Ability to work as part of a team of researchers working on similar topics, but from different disciplines.
* Interested in collaborating with governmental, policy, and industry stakeholders.
* Fluent in spoken and written English.
* We particularly welcome applications from candidates belonging to groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in academia, including, but not limited to, women and ethnic minorities.


**Conditions of Employment**
* A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:
* Full\-time employment for four years, with an intermediate assessment after nine months. You will spend a minimum of 10% of your four\-year employment on teaching tasks, with a maximum of 15% per year of your employment.
* Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, scale P (min. € 2,901 max. € 3,707\).
* A year\-end bonus of 8\.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
* High\-quality training programs and other support to grow into a self\-aware, autonomous scientific researcher. At TU/e we challenge you to take charge of your own learning process.
* An excellent technical infrastructure, on\-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
* An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
* A Staff Immigration Team and a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) for international candidates.

We’re crafting a metric that measures how achievable AI\-generated advice is—for real people. Think of it as teaching AI common sense; for instance, you can’t just age a decade instantly.

 Counterfactual explanations are considered an intuitive and user\-friendly form of explainable AI. A counterfactual explanation ­proposes minimal changes to the input data that would lead to a different model output. As an example, a bank could make use of a model to determine if a customer can get a loan or not. If a customer was denied a loan, a counterfactual explanation could tell them that, for instance, “if their savings were increased by 10\.000€, they could get the loan”.
   

  

 However, counterfactual explanations are not aware of the semantics of the input features. It might be that the minimal change for a customer to get a loan is to “increase their age from 25 to 35 years old” which, from a human perspective, is evidently unfeasible in a short time span.
   

  

**The Assignment**
 In this project, we would like you to design a new evaluation metric to automatically determine the practicality of counterfactuals, that is, how attainable a counterfactual explanation is (or if it is even humanly attainable). Since the determination of practicality involves semantic understanding of the input features, our idea would be to leverage GPT and/or other large language model\-based technologies to accomplish this.
   

  

 A user study could be conducted initially following the methodology proposed by Spreitzer et al (1\) to evaluate the practicality of different state\-of\-the\-art counterfactual techniques. The user study can then be extended to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed metric compared to the human evaluations.

 We zien steeds meer mogelijkheden om AI in te zetten voor het schrijven van code. In het geval van GitHub en bijvoorbeeld Copilot is de productiviteit al met tot 50% verbeterd. Dat is een indrukwekkend cijfer. Maar kunnen we nog verder gaan? We merken bij onze klanten dat het maken van ETL pipelines veel tijd kost. Veel van deze pipelines lijken op elkaar. We verzamelen data op een staginglocatie, transformeren deze data om diverse kwaliteitsproblemen op te lossen, en zetten de data vervolgens om naar een dimensioneel formaat of naar een feature set voor machine learning.

Autonomous greenhouses, AI\-driven farming, and robotics promise efficiency, precision, and sustainability—but what will this transition look like, in practice? This PhD project critically examines the potential emergence of ethical and societal frictions, as agricultural automation reshapes knowledge, labour, and governance structures.*  



**Job Description**  

This project will explore fundamental questions raised by agricultural automation as a politically and societally embedded phenomenon. For example, what does it mean when decisions about cultivation—once made by farmers—are increasingly determined by algorithms and robotic systems? How do these technologies structure new forms of dependence, control, and opacity, and what kinds of epistemic assumptions about farming, efficiency, and nature underpin their design? Who designs these systems, and whose expertise is legitimized or erased in the process? What knowledge traditions—sensor data, machine learning models, agronomic science—are prioritized over others, such as local, experiential, or traditional agricultural knowledge?

  

  

Automation does not just transform work; it reconfigures entire agro\-technical imaginaries, shaping new relationships between humans, technology, and the environment. By adopting a critical, interdisciplinary approach, the aim of this PhD project is to open up new ways of thinking about automation—beyond progress\-driven narratives—to address the structural, normative, and ontological shifts that automated agriculture entails.

  

  

This project will be embedded within the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASoS, Maastricht) as well as at the Brightlands Smart Autonomous Sustainable Systems research facility (Venlo), a site where cutting\-edge automation is being developed and tested. The facility will not only serve as a case study but as an active field of engagement, allowing the PhD researcher to observe and interact with engineers, farmers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. The research will involve a combination of theoretical inquiry and empirical investigation, potentially including ethnographic fieldwork, interviews, discourse analysis, and policy studies.

  

  

At FASoS the position is embedded in the Maastricht University Science and Technology Studies Research Group (MUSTS). There you will be supervised by Professor Darian Meacham and Dr. Dani Shanley. You will be provided with training on general academic skills in the faculty’s Graduate School. Further training is available through the Dutch national research school in science and technology studies (STS) and/or philosophy. As part of this project, you will also work together with other PhD students working on topics related to the philosophy of technology.

  

  

**Tasks**


* Conduct empirical and theoretical research on the socio\-technical entanglements of agricultural automation.
* Investigate how automation reconfigures knowledge, labour, and agency within agrifood systems.
* Analyse legal and regulatory frameworks for autonomous farming and assess how they reflect—or obscure—broader ethical concerns.
* Engage with engineers, farmers, policymakers, and technology developers to trace the frictions and negotiations shaping automation in practice.
* Contribute to philosophy of technology, science and technology studies (STS), and legal scholarship on automation, control, and governance.

  




The main task will be to complete the PhD in the allotted time.

  


The successful candidate is also expected to take part in the main activities of the department and the research group (MUSTS). These include:


* Publish results at top\-tier (international) conferences and in international journals;
* Assist with educational tasks (e.g., teach at undergraduate level, supervise students and internships);
* Assist with the organisation of workshops, conferences and meetings;
* Participate in conferences, workshops and internal meetings and seminars.

  




**Requirements**


* An MA or Research Master degree, in one or more of the following fields: philosophy of technology, science and technology studies (STS), political philosophy, or a related field;
* A strong critical perspective on emerging technologies and their societal implications;
* Experience with qualitative research methods (e.g., ethnography, discourse analysis, policy analysis);
* An interest in automation, AI ethics, and socio\-technical imaginaries, particularly in the context of agriculture;
* Excellent analytical and writing skills, with the ability to engage across disciplines;
* Fluency in English (Dutch proficiency is an advantage but not required).

Op de bruisende en inspirerende campus werkt en studeert een internationale gemeenschap van bijna 7\.000 medewerkers en 13\.000 studenten.


Maatschappelijke uitdagingen vragen om nieuwe kennis. Het is de taak van de TU/e om deze kennis te ontwikkelen door onderzoek en onderwijs aan te passen en te veranderen. Bij Library and Information Services (LIS) kijken we samen met onze wetenschappers en studenten vooruit en bieden we voortdurend de best mogelijke bibliotheek\- en informatiediensten om het creëren van deze nieuwe kennis mogelijk te maken.

### **Functieomschrijving**

**DE ORGANISATIE**


De Technische Universiteit Eindhoven (**TU/e**) is een toonaangevende en internationaal georiënteerde universiteit, gespecialiseerd in techniek, wetenschap en technologie. Zij staan bekend om grote wetenschappelijke impact en de ontwikkeling van technologische innovaties. De TU/e is *“the place where innovation starts”* met digitalisering als een van de belangrijkste *enablers*. De universiteit onderscheidt zich door een nauwe samenwerking met de industrie en gezamenlijke onderzoeksprogramma’s met andere onderwijsinstellingen en onderzoekscentra. Zij zijn een koploper in AI\-onderzoek, en investeren dan ook fors in een state\-of\-the\-art infrastructuur voor haar onderzoekers; zo zijn zij één van de eerste Europese organisaties die een *NVIDIA DGX B200 AI\-supercomputer* krijgt. Daarnaast werkt de TU/e aan optimale ondersteuning van *challenge\-based learning* en individuele leerpaden voor studenten en optimaliseren zij de dienstverlening van ondersteunende diensten met focus op het leveren van *end\-to\-end services* en het harmoniseren van processen.


De TU/e onderwijst studenten (ruim 13\.000\), doet onderzoek en bevordert kennis in wetenschap en technologie ten behoeve van de mensheid/de maatschappij. Zij integreren – met ruim 7\.000 medewerkers \- onderwijs en onderzoek om studenten en wetenschappers in staat te stellen *thought leaders* te worden en het ondenkbare te ontwerpen en te bereiken. In nauwe samenwerking met publieke en private partners vertalen zij fundamenteel onderzoek naar zinvolle oplossingen. Bij de TU/e omarmen en handelen zij volgens vier **CORe**\-values.


De TU/e is georganiseerd in 9 faculteiten (departments) en 4 onderzoeksinstituten (research institutes), wordt bestuurd door een College van Bestuur (CvB, Executive Board) en ondersteund door 9 diensten (support services) zoals vormgegeven in onderstaand organogram.


De ingenieurs die door de TU/e worden opgeleid zijn klaar om de uiterst complexe (maatschappelijke) uitdagingen van vandaag en morgen aan te gaan; de duurzaamheidstransitie, technologische revolutie en de toenemende impact van technologie op onze maatschappij. Deze uitdagingen, gecombineerd met andere *drivers of change*, dwingen de universiteit om koers (strategie 2030\) te bepalen; de TU/e wil *“de verandering leiden door toonaangevend onderwijs, onderzoek en valorisatie/impact,”* waarbij zij zich richten op 3 strategische thema's:

* **Talent:** op alle niveaus, want talent maakt of breekt de universiteit.
* **Samenwerking:** samenwerking met de industrie, nationaal en internationaal, binnen de Brainportregio, met alliantiepartners en op Europees niveau.
* **Veerkracht**: de organisatie continu optimaliseren en professionaliseren om de verandering mogelijk te maken een aan te laten sluiten op de ambities.

**DE DIENST**


De (service)dienst Library and Information Services (**LIS**) is verantwoordelijk voor de gehele vraag\- en aanbodketen op het gebied van informatiebeheer/\-voorziening (IV), IT en bibliotheekdiensten. De servicedienst is getransformeerd naar een productgerichte structuur, met *empowered* productteams die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de professionele dienstverlening en verdere ontwikkeling van hun product. In overleg met belanghebbenden worden behoeften verzameld, geprioriteerd en afgestemd. LIS omarmt de *Agile* mindset en werkmethoden. Binnen LIS werken circa 300 medewerkers en komt veel ondersteuning vanuit de universiteit (zoals van studentassistenten). De servicedienst bestaat uit zeven productgebieden (*areas*): Services, Library \& Open Science, Research, Education, Corporate, Data \& Insights en als laatste Platforms.


LIS opereert als IT/IV\-organisatie binnen de context van de technische universiteit. Zij voegt waarde toe door haar unieke kennis van de organisatie en klanten/gebruikers (de studenten, onderzoekers en overige medewerkers) te combineren met kennis van de markt en nieuwe ontwikkelingen/innovaties. Iedere faculteit en opleiding heeft eigen specifieke behoeften en ideeën. LIS werkt samen met haar klanten aan een veelheid aan oplossingen; dit doen zij vanuit ontwikkelde standaarden, met een persoonlijke/maatwerkbenadering (waar nodig) en inlevingsvermogen. Zo ontzorgen zij het primaire proces, waardoor zij hun focus naar onderwijs, onderzoek en impact kan uitgaan. Haar landschap is hierdoor complex en omvangrijk/breed; van applicaties, systemen tot infrastructuur, architectuur en platforms. Zij zijn als servicedienst gericht op samenwerken in de regio en met andere kennisinstellingen, hetgeen bijdraagt aan de innovatiekracht en het open karakter van de TU/e.


De LIS\-organisatie ziet ontwikkelingen razendsnel op haar afkomen en dat vraagt om meer flexibiliteit in haar dienstverlening. Daarom werken zij sinds 2023 volgens *Agile* principes. Hoewel anno 2025 zeer veel bereikt is, is de transformatie nog niet afgerond. Een van de taken van de CIO is om deze Agile\-transformatie verder te begeleiden en een solide organisatie (volgens de reeds ingeslagen route) neer te zetten met als doel wendbaar te blijven in een steeds veranderende organisatie. Deze transformatie is het resultaat van een groter doel dat de TU/e uitdraagt middels het programma Support QUAlity Drive (**SQUAD**) waarbij de diensten efficiënter en effectiever ingericht worden en ketensamenwerking in een netwerkorganisatie met een *end\-to\-end* verantwoordelijkheid een belangrijke drijfveer is.

**Interne organisatie**


Als onderdeel van deze transformatie heeft een herindeling van de afdeling plaatsgevonden in productgebieden (*areas*); in 7 areas werken zij nu in een product\-georiënteerd operating model volgens de Agile principes. Product teams bestaan uit product owners, scrummasters en experts die gezamenlijk integraal verantwoordelijk zijn voor het product dat ze leveren. Zij hebben daarbij gekozen voor duaal management en werken met product area leads (**PAL’s**) en competence managers (**CM’s**). Samen vormen de PAL’s (7\) en CM’s (4\) het management team.

**Strategie**


In 2024 is de LIS\-/digitaliseringsstrategie geïntroduceerd met als pijlers:  

 •Kennis •Ontwikkeling •Partnerschap •Digitalisering


De digitaliseringsstrategie omvat 5 strategische thema’s (*big bets*) rondom onderzoek, onderwijs, bedrijfsvoering, living labs en infrastructuur. Tot en met 2027 investeert de TU/e fors om deze ambitieuze strategie te realiseren.

**Resultaatgebieden**


De ingezette transformatie heeft al veel gebracht, waarbij de LIS\-organisatie nu toe is aan de volgende stap die zij graag samen met een nieuwe directeur gaan zetten. De resultaatgebieden waar zij voor staan zijn:

* Doorbouwen aan een visie voor de toekomst
* Tillen van haar dienstverlening naar een hoger niveau tillen (van reactief naar meer proactief)

* Onderzoeken future governance in samenwerking met andere diensten en faculteiten

Jouw werk
Als Control Engineer op de afdeling R\&D Passenger Tire werk je samen in een multidisciplinair team met Mechnical en Electrical Engineers aan het ontwerpen van de software van de machines, installaties en of deelsystemen.

Technische kennis is er dan ook in overvloed, kortom een mooie kans om jouw kennis te verbreden binnen Engineering. Door de grootte van het bedrijf zijn er voldoende uitdagingen en doorgroeimogelijkheden.



Hierbij valt te denken aan een overstap naar een andere productgroep, eventuele overstap van Order Engineering naar R\&D of andersom, meer verantwoordelijkheid als bijvoorbeeld lead engineer, project engineer, coördinator of doorgroei naar een andere afdeling binnen VMI.



Verder is van belang om te vermelden:


* Naast een prima salaris bieden we een goede balans tussen werk en privé onder andere door een ruime verlofregeling van 40 verlofdagen (bij fulltime dienstverband), mogelijkheden voor thuiswerken en een flexibel werkrooster.

De complexiteit in de wijk neemt steeds verder toe. Care\- en case\-complexe casuïstiek zijn inmiddels écht van alle dag. Als verpleegkundige bij Sensire richt jij je op de zorg van de toekomst waar (pionieren met) innovatie en digitalisering een belangrijke plaats innemen. Spreekt jou dit aan? Lees dan snel verder!
**Wat ga je doen als verpleegkundige?**  

  

Als verpleegkundige wil jij het liefst aan de slag met zorgtaken waarvoor je bent opgeleid: inventariseren van zorgbehoefte, coördineren van de zorgverlening en uitvoeren van hoog complexe zorg met een combinatie van care\- complex (verpleegtechnisch handelen) en case\-complex (achtergrond/situatie). Door de grote diversiteit aan zorgvragen bij klanten in de wijk is het niet altijd mogelijk om alléén dit type werk te doen, daar moeten we realistisch in zijn. Uiteraard streven we dit wel na.


**Welkom in gemeente Montferland**


Montferland is een veelzijdige gemeente met in elke wijk een andere sociale mix van klanten, met alle uitdagingen die daarbij horen. Collega’s geven aan dat de klanten zowel in het dorp als in het buitengebied erg toegankelijk zijn en jou als zorgprofessional waarderen. Jouw zorgteam is je basis, waar verbinding, waardering en gezelligheid belangrijke waarden zijn. We hebben oog voor elkaar en zorgen voor een gemoedelijke werksfeer waarin we steeds nieuwe inzichten en ideeën opdoen die de kwaliteit van onze zorg ten goede komen. In gemeente Montferland werken we in drie verschillende gebieden: Bosrijk (o.a. Beek, Kilder en Zeddam), Didam en S´heerenberg. Je komt te werken in een team van (wijk)verpleegkundigen, verzorgenden IG en helpenden (plus). Ondanks dat je zelfstandig op pad gaat in de wijk, sta je er nooit echt alleen voor; jouw collega's staan altijd klaar om je te ondersteunen op de achtergrond. Kom jij werken in regio Montferland?

**Zo dragen we bij aan jouw werkgeluk**  

  

Er zijn een aantal zaken waar je zelf de regie op kunt en moet pakken. Je hebt daardoor de vrijheid om keuzes te maken die passen bij jouw persoonlijke situatie en behoeften en zorgen voor een goede balans tussen werk en privé.

* Jij maakt de keuze hoeveel uur per week je wil werken. De planner zet dit naar rato van je contract om naar een aantal diensten van zes of acht uur. Je hoeft hierdoor minder dagen per week te werken en er zijn geen gebroken diensten meer;
* Bij Sensire werken we met diensten van 6 of 8 uur die bestaan uit geplande klantzorg en niet\-geplande tijd om te vullen met directe tijd (GFI, rapporteren en inlezen, overdracht naar collega’s);
* De starttijd van de route binnen de dienst kan variëren. Soms begin je direct bij start van je dienst met de geplande klantzorg. Soms heb je eerst niet\-geplande tijd. Dat geeft veel flexibiliteit;
* Samen met je collega’s ben je verantwoordelijk voor de telefonische bereikbaarheid als onderdeel van je dienst;
* Je hoeft geen nachtdiensten te draaien;
* Je krijgt van ons een chromebook en smartphone in bruikleen.

De functie verpleegkundige valt in de schaal FWG 45 conform de cao VVT. Afhankelijk van de ervaring die je meebrengt bepalen we de exacte hoogte van jouw salaris.  
* 

  

**Wie ben jij?**  

  

Werken in de wijk is werken in een uitdagende werkomgeving met veel diversiteit. Je weet eigenlijk nooit wat je achter de deur aantreft. Dat vraagt van jou veel. Snel schakelen en individueel handelen is soms noodzakelijk zonder dat je in de stress schiet. Je draagt hierdoor een grote verantwoordelijkheid. Met een gezonde dosis nieuwsgierigheid weet jij de wensen en behoeften van onze klant feilloos te achterhalen, je weet de juiste prioriteiten te stellen en stemt daar de ondersteuning die je biedt op af. Preventie is een vanzelfsprekend onderdeel van jouw benadering.
  

  

**Praktische zaken**  

  

Om aan de slag je kunnen als verpleegkundige vragen wij een aantal praktische zaken van jou:

* Een afgeronde mbo\-opleiding verpleegkunde niveau 4 of hbo\-V opleiding;
* Je bent in het bezit van een BIG\-registratie en bent minimaal bevoegd voor het uitvoeren van voorbehouden en risicovolle handelingen;
* Je bent in het bezit van een rijbewijs;

-----------------


Retrieval\-augmented generation (RAG) has become more and more popular due to its potential to achieve comparable performance with smaller models compared with large LLM modes. In the RAG architecture, the knowledge is embedded and stored in external vector databases for retrieval of relevant knowledge by the LLMs instead of the model weights during training. To process a user query, the RAG framework first retrieves relevant knowledge from the vector database, and this knowledge is fed to the generator (an LLM) as external knowledge to generate the final answer. Advanced RAG frameworks retrieve the knowledge from the vector database multiple times during the generation. Thus, the vector database plays an important role in the end\-to\-end performance of RAG such as accuracy and latency. However, RAG also brings new challenges to vector databases as the ever\-increasing size of datasets cannot fit into the main memory and thus needs to be offloaded to SSDs.  

  

The aim of this exploratory project is to understand what roles VectorDB plays in the performance of overall RAG pipelines, and how modern fast storage help accelerate the performance of VectorDBs.

**Your duties**


* Building programs that investigates the differences in latency, throughput, and scalability of different vector database and indexing algorithms.
* Investigating how the performance of vector databases affect the end\-to\-end performance of RAG.
* Help with building the next generation of vector databases for the RAG workloads.

Do you want to collaborate in an interdisciplinary setting on cutting\-edge research projects aimed at understanding and mitigating the impacts of global change on Dutch ecosystems? If so, this opportunity could be the perfect fit for you!**  

  

Wageningen University's ""Sector Plan Biology"" has been developed to perform fundamental biological research in the framework of evolutionary and ecological theory to connect the various levels of biological organization to understand the dynamics of biological variation. In Theme 5 \- “Resilient and multifunctional landscapes”, we are looking for **two PhD candidates** working on resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across landscapes.  

  

Focusing on landscapes around Wageningen, you will explore how landscape context and previous ecosystem conditions affect the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem functions to wildfires or other highly relevant disturbances. Methodologically, you will apply experimental approaches and repeated field assessment to gain a mechanistic understanding of resilience at the plot level.  

  

There are two PhD positions available in this project; PhD A will focus on biodiversity (plants and animals) and PhD B on ecosystem functions and services (related to soils and vegetation) within the same study design. The focal taxa and functions are yet to be defined, taking the interests and skills of the successful PhD candidates into consideration. Both PhD candidates will conduct intensive fieldwork for at least two field seasons. Activities include the setup of a strong study design across various landscapes around Wageningen, data collection to quantify biodiversity and species interactions (position A), data collection to quantify ecosystem functions and services (position B), advanced statistical data analyses and modelling, and writing manuscripts.  

  

**You will work here**  

Both positions are funded through the Sector Plan Biology. Daily supervision will be by Dr. Iris Hordijk (Forest Ecology and Management) and Dr. Dominic Martin (Wildlife Ecology and Conservation) for position A and by Dr. Amanda Taylor (PEN), Dr. Merel Hofmeijer (Farming Systems Ecology), and Dr. Luciana Chavez (Soil Biology) for position B. Wageningen University \& Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:* Partially paid parental leave;
* working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work\-life balance;
* there is a strong focus on vitality and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
* a fixed year\-end bonus of 8\.3%;
* excellent pension scheme.


In addition to these first\-rate employee benefits, you will receive a fully funded PhD position and you will be offered a course program tailored to your needs and the research team.  

  

The gross salary for the first year is € 2\.901,\- per month rising to € 3\.707,\- in the fourth year in according to the Collective Labour Agreements for Dutch Universities (CAO\-NU) (scale P). This is based on a full\-time working week of 38 hours. We offer a temporary contract for 18 months which will be extended for the duration of the project if you perform well.  

  

Wageningen University \& Research offers plenty of opportunities for growth and development, with a strong internal recruitment policy and excellent training programmes.  

  

You will work on the greenest and most innovative campus in the Netherlands, in an international and open working environment. For 20 consecutive years, we have been voted the ""best university"" in the Netherlands! A place to be proud of.  

  

**Coming from abroad**  

Wageningen University \& Research is the university and research centre for life sciences. The themes we deal with are relevant to everyone around the world and Wageningen, therefore, has a large international community and a lot to offer to international employees.

**PhD candidate Paper Mills and Systematic Manipulation in Research Publishing**  

The past decade has seen the rise of distinct new challenges for research integrity in the context of scientific publishing. These include the proliferation of paper mills, defined by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) as operations through “which manufactured manuscripts are submitted to a journal for a fee on behalf of researchers with the purpose of providing an easy publication for them, or to offer authorship for sale”. Research also suggests an uptick in related forms of systematic manipulation of the publishing process, such as fraudulent editorial handling and peer review as well as mechanisms to artificially inflate citations to manuscripts. Most recently, generative AI has made it easier to produce not just fake manuscripts and manipulate images and measurements, but also deceive plagiarism scanners more effectively. Scientific publications involving these and other forms of misconduct usually lack a genuine contribution to the scholarly literature, characterized by low or non\-existant methodological rigor, and originality. Besides the problem of circulating contributions without scholarly merit and potential abuse of research grants, they create serious problems in the form of safety risks for patients and other supposed beneficiaries of scientific research.


In collaboration with the publishing company Wiley and the University of Sheffield, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) at Leiden University is recruiting a PhD candidate to carry out research on paper mills and related forms of systematic manipulation in scientific publishing. The focus of the research will be on the operation and scale of such practices in different national contexts and research fields; how they are enabled by local career and incentive systems; and how science systems could effectively combat them.

  

**What you will do**  

The purpose of this position is to produce original PhD research that contributes to the goals of the CWTS strategic Focal Area on Evaluation \& Culture. The research entails the following:

* Develop an original, empirical social science research project on paper mills and related forms of systematic manipulation in scientific publishing in different national contexts and research fields, with a focus on understanding their operation and scale and how they are enabled by local career and incentive systems.
* Develop and apply suitable new research methods, for example by combining quantitative approaches to reconstruct suspicious activities in the context of journal submissions with participant observation in online settings, survey research, and semi\-structured interviews.
* Contribute to the development of strategies for combating paper mills.
* Participate in the life of CWTS; this may include contributions to teaching of courses and other training events related to the research topic.

The research will be jointly supervised by Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner (Leiden), Stephen Pinfield (Sheffield), and Ludo Waltman (Leiden).


**Where you will work**  

The Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences consists of five institutes: Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology, Political Science, and Psychology. The faculty has approximately 7000 students and 1000 staff members. Within the institutes, not only education is provided but also groundbreaking research is conducted that pushes the boundaries of our understanding of human behaviour and societal structures.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) is looking for a:

**PhD Candidate on Exploring Pareidolia in Computer Vision to Enhance Interpretability, Robustness, and Creativity in AI**


Why does an AI think something is a face —or not? This PhD project investigates pareidolia—the brain’s tendency to perceive faces in non\-face visuals such as clouds, sockets, and tree trunks—as a tool to enhance interpretability, robustness, and creativity in computer vision. While human vision is remarkably adaptive and creative, current AI models struggle to recognize or convincingly generate pareidolic patterns. Understanding why this gap between human and machine perception emerges can guide the development of more human\-like AI systems.


Pareidolia is deeply embedded in human perception and has inspired art and creativity —for example, in Salvador Dali’s ‘Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire’. The project will explore the interplay between pareidolia, creativity, and aesthetics, particularly through the lens of generative AI. This line of inquiry could inspire AI\-generated content, interactive design tools, and emotionally resonant products, especially in the fields like robotics and user experience.


This position offers a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of computer vision, interpretability, human perception, and computational creativity. You will be embedded in the Human AI cluster, at the Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) at Leiden University, supervised by dr. Derya Soydaner, dr. Joost Broekens, and dr. Rob Saunders.

 **Key responsibilities**

* Develop, fine\-tune, and evaluate computer vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, generative models) with an emphasis on interpretability, robustness, and creativity;
* Design and implement experiments to investigate human and machine perception of pareidolia, and conduct original research in computer vision;
* Explore generative AI techniques to synthesize pareidolic imagery and assess model outputs for perceptual and creative relevance;
* Curate and/or utilize benchmark datasets of pareidolic visuals, and apply statistical and machine learning methods to analyze visual data and model behavior;
* Publish and present research findings in leading AI conferences and journals;
* Engage with interdisciplinary concepts from psychology, vision science, and art to enrich research perspectives;
* Contribute to teaching and the open\-source dissemination of models and datasets;
* Assist in relevant teaching activities;

 **Selection Criteria**  

We are looking for a candidate that meets the following criteria:

* MSc degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or a related field;
* Strong background in image processing, computer vision, and deep learning;
* Excellent programming skills (Python preferred), with experience in large\-scale image processing and deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow);
* Interest in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI, human perception, and creativity;
* Familiarity with computer vision tasks (e.g., object detection, face recognition, generative models) and experience with generative AI models is a plus;
* Curiosity or background in vision science, psychology, cognitive science, or art is a plus;
* Self\-motivated, creative, and able to work both independently and as a part of a research team;
* Strong analytical and problem\-solving skills;
* Excellent written and oral communication skills in English;
* Strong ability to manage multiple tasks and meet deadlines in a dynamic research environment.

The Faculty of Science, Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, is looking for a:

 **PhD candidate for End\-to\-End Causal Learning (1\.0 fte)**

 **Project description**


Causal inference is one of the primary goals in empirical sciences, including medicine, biology, economy, and physical science. For instance, researchers may seek to estimate the effects of smoking on lung cancer, education on salaries, or specific genes on phenotypes. If we have only access to observational data, a part of causal relations among the variables can be recovered, and hence, the investigator is commonly left with some (or in some cases many) unresolved causal relations. On the other hand, if we can perform experiments in the system, the causal graph representing the underlying system can be fully recovered from sufficient number of interventions. However, in many practical cases, performing each intervention might take days to complete or be too costly.


In this project, we aim to develop an end\-to\-end framework for the task of causal inference. This framework comprises three main components: causal discovery, identification analysis, and experiment design. The causal discovery part learns a causal model of the environment from the available data. This model is then used in the identification analysis to get an estimate of the causal effect. If the estimation is not accurate, a limited number of experiments are performed through the experiment design part to enhance knowledge about the underlying system, thereby improving the accuracy of causal effect estimation. This project combines techniques from statistics, graphical model learning, and stochastic optimization, embracing an interdisciplinary approach.

  

The candidate will be embedded in the Explanatory Data Analysis group at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science. More information about the group can be found at https://eda.liacs.nl/

  

**Key responsibilities**

* Conduct original and novel research in the field of causal inference/discovery;
* Explore applications of causal discovery/inference in other fields such as generative AI and reinforcement learning;

**PhD candidate Paper Mills and Systematic Manipulation in Research Publishing**  

The past decade has seen the rise of distinct new challenges for research integrity in the context of scientific publishing. These include the proliferation of paper mills, defined by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) as operations through “which manufactured manuscripts are submitted to a journal for a fee on behalf of researchers with the purpose of providing an easy publication for them, or to offer authorship for sale”. Research also suggests an uptick in related forms of systematic manipulation of the publishing process, such as fraudulent editorial handling and peer review as well as mechanisms to artificially inflate citations to manuscripts. Most recently, generative AI has made it easier to produce not just fake manuscripts and manipulate images and measurements, but also deceive plagiarism scanners more effectively. Scientific publications involving these and other forms of misconduct usually lack a genuine contribution to the scholarly literature, characterized by low or non\-existant methodological rigor, and originality. Besides the problem of circulating contributions without scholarly merit and potential abuse of research grants, they create serious problems in the form of safety risks for patients and other supposed beneficiaries of scientific research.


In collaboration with the publishing company Wiley and the University of Sheffield, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) at Leiden University is recruiting a PhD candidate to carry out research on paper mills and related forms of systematic manipulation in scientific publishing. The focus of the research will be on the operation and scale of such practices in different national contexts and research fields; how they are enabled by local career and incentive systems; and how science systems could effectively combat them.


**What you will do**  

The purpose of this position is to produce original PhD research that contributes to the goals of the CWTS strategic Focal Area on Evaluation \& Culture. The research entails the following:


* Develop an original, empirical social science research project on paper mills and related forms of systematic manipulation in scientific publishing in different national contexts and research fields, with a focus on understanding their operation and scale and how they are enabled by local career and incentive systems.
* Develop and apply suitable new research methods, for example by combining quantitative approaches to reconstruct suspicious activities in the context of journal submissions with participant observation in online settings, survey research, and semi\-structured interviews.
* Contribute to the development of strategies for combating paper mills.
* Participate in the life of CWTS; this may include contributions to teaching of courses and other training events related to the research topic.


The research will be jointly supervised by Wolfgang Kaltenbrunner (Leiden), Stephen Pinfield (Sheffield), and Ludo Waltman (Leiden).


**Where you will work**  

The Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences consists of five institutes: Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Cultural Anthropology and Development Sociology, Political Science, and Psychology.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) is looking for a:

**PhD Candidate on Exploring Pareidolia in Computer Vision to Enhance Interpretability, Robustness, and Creativity in AI**


Why does an AI think something is a face —or not? This PhD project investigates pareidolia—the brain’s tendency to perceive faces in non\-face visuals such as clouds, sockets, and tree trunks—as a tool to enhance interpretability, robustness, and creativity in computer vision. While human vision is remarkably adaptive and creative, current AI models struggle to recognize or convincingly generate pareidolic patterns. Understanding why this gap between human and machine perception emerges can guide the development of more human\-like AI systems.


Pareidolia is deeply embedded in human perception and has inspired art and creativity —for example, in Salvador Dali’s ‘Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire’. The project will explore the interplay between pareidolia, creativity, and aesthetics, particularly through the lens of generative AI. This line of inquiry could inspire AI\-generated content, interactive design tools, and emotionally resonant products, especially in the fields like robotics and user experience.


This position offers a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of computer vision, interpretability, human perception, and computational creativity. You will be embedded in the Human AI cluster, at the Leiden Institute for Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) at Leiden University, supervised by dr. Derya Soydaner, dr. Joost Broekens, and dr. Rob Saunders.

 **Key responsibilities**

* Develop, fine\-tune, and evaluate computer vision models (e.g., CNNs, ViTs, generative models) with an emphasis on interpretability, robustness, and creativity;
* Design and implement experiments to investigate human and machine perception of pareidolia, and conduct original research in computer vision;
* Explore generative AI techniques to synthesize pareidolic imagery and assess model outputs for perceptual and creative relevance;
* Curate and/or utilize benchmark datasets of pareidolic visuals, and apply statistical and machine learning methods to analyze visual data and model behavior;
* Publish and present research findings in leading AI conferences and journals;
* Engage with interdisciplinary concepts from psychology, vision science, and art to enrich research perspectives;
* Contribute to teaching and the open\-source dissemination of models and datasets;
* Assist in relevant teaching activities;

 **Selection Criteria**  

We are looking for a candidate that meets the following criteria:

* MSc degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or a related field;
* Strong background in image processing, computer vision, and deep learning;
* Excellent programming skills (Python preferred), with experience in large\-scale image processing and deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow);
* Interest in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of AI, human perception, and creativity;
* Familiarity with computer vision tasks (e.g., object detection, face recognition, generative models) and experience with generative AI models is a plus;
* Curiosity or background in vision science, psychology, cognitive science, or art is a plus;
* Self\-motivated, creative, and able to work both independently and as a part of a research team;
* Strong analytical and problem\-solving skills;
* Excellent written and oral communication skills in English;
* Strong ability to manage multiple tasks and meet deadlines in a dynamic research environment.

The Faculty of Science, Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, is looking for a:

 **PhD candidate for End\-to\-End Causal Learning (1\.0 fte)**

 **Project description**


Causal inference is one of the primary goals in empirical sciences, including medicine, biology, economy, and physical science. For instance, researchers may seek to estimate the effects of smoking on lung cancer, education on salaries, or specific genes on phenotypes. If we have only access to observational data, a part of causal relations among the variables can be recovered, and hence, the investigator is commonly left with some (or in some cases many) unresolved causal relations. On the other hand, if we can perform experiments in the system, the causal graph representing the underlying system can be fully recovered from sufficient number of interventions. However, in many practical cases, performing each intervention might take days to complete or be too costly.


In this project, we aim to develop an end\-to\-end framework for the task of causal inference. This framework comprises three main components: causal discovery, identification analysis, and experiment design. The causal discovery part learns a causal model of the environment from the available data. This model is then used in the identification analysis to get an estimate of the causal effect. If the estimation is not accurate, a limited number of experiments are performed through the experiment design part to enhance knowledge about the underlying system, thereby improving the accuracy of causal effect estimation. This project combines techniques from statistics, graphical model learning, and stochastic optimization, embracing an interdisciplinary approach.

  

The candidate will be embedded in the Explanatory Data Analysis group at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science. More information about the group can be found at https://eda.liacs.nl/

  

**Key responsibilities**

* Conduct original and novel research in the field of causal inference/discovery;
* Explore applications of causal discovery/inference in other fields such as generative AI and reinforcement learning;
* Publish and present scientific articles in top ML venues;
* Contribute to educational activities;
* Write a dissertation.

**Selection Criteria**

* A MSc degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, or a related field;
* Strong knowledge of and experienced with statistics, machine learning, and stochastic optimization;
* Highly motivated to both perform foundational machine learning research and apply the developed methods in real applications;
* Creative, ‘making things work’ mentality, independent, and communicative team player;
* Experienced with writing scientific manuscripts and academic writing skills;
* Excellent programming skills (Python and ML packages);
* Interested in participating in educational activities;

In deze opdracht ontwikkel je een open\-source tool die Maven\-dependencies beoordeelt op kwaliteit, onderhoud en populariteit. Daarmee help je ontwikkelaars beter kiezen én sneller ingrijpen als een dependency verslechtert.**

**Interessegebieden:** Maven, Java, open\-source


Stel je voor dat je een huis bouwt met bakstenen waarvan je de sterkte niet kent. Best eng, toch? In software is dat niet anders. Dependencies in een Maven\-project zijn net zulke bouwstenen. De vraag is: hoe check je of die blokken stevig genoeg zijn?

**De opdracht**
---------------


Je gaat aan de slag met Maven. Je onderzoekt hoe je dependencies kunt beoordelen en daar scores aan kunt geven op basis van onderhoud, kwaliteit en populariteit. Je maakt hierbij gebruik van publiek beschikbare gegevens zoals commit\-historie, sterren en het aantal contributors.


Daarnaast zorg je dat jouw oplossing overweg kan met GitHub, Azure DevOps en eventueel GitLab.


Jouw opdracht wordt het bouwen van een open\-source bijdrage, zodat de hele wereld straks jouw broncode kan inzien én gebruiken. De tool die je ontwikkelt, is geschikt voor Maven\-projecten en helpt bij het selecteren van de juiste dependencies tijdens de ontwerpfase. Tijdens het onderhoud signaleert jouw oplossing vroegtijdig welke dependencies in score achteruitgaan. Hierdoor kun je innovatief en proactief onderhoud plegen én klanten tijdig informeren over het planbaar vervangen van onderdelen. Zo voorkom je onverwachte problemen en houd je de kwaliteit van je software hoog.

**Tech lead**

Ben jij die ondernemende tech lead die niet alleen iets wil bouwen, maar ook impact wil maken? Zoek jij werk met betekenis – werk dat er maatschappelijk écht toe doet? Dan willen wij jou spreken.

Het Scribe Collectief is op zoek naar een iemand die verder wil bouwen aan Robin, onze innovatieve AI\-tool die administratiedruk in de GGZ drastisch vermindert.

Je bouwt samen met het team, scribes en zorgverleners, verder aan een nieuwe digitale tak van het bedrijf en blijft door ontwikkelen met innovatieve oplossingen die de zorg toekomstbestendig maken. Op een ondernemende manier zorg je dat Robin naadloos aansluit bij de behoefte van de zorgverleners.

Jouw kernmissie is de technische doorontwikkeling van Robin. Je zet bovendien de infrastructuur neer die nodig is om verder op te schalen. Daarnaast speel je een rol bij de adoptie van de tool, zodat deze ook daadwerkelijk gebruikt wordt.

Waarom deze rol ertoe doet?

De GGZ piept en kraakt. De administratielast is torenhoog en zorgverleners raken overbelast. Hierdoor wachten mensen met psychische klachten soms maanden op hulp. Wij vinden dat dat anders moet – en jij kunt daarbij het verschil maken.

**Robin.**  
Robin zet gesprekken automatisch om in gestructureerde samenvattingen, waardoor behandelaren minder tijd kwijt zijn aan verslaglegging. Dit betekent dat een groot deel van de taken sneller en nauwkeuriger uitgevoerd kan worden, waardoor onze Scribes nog meer behandelaren kunnen ondersteunen.

Robin is ontwikkeld samen met behandelaren, zodat het perfect aansluit op de praktijk en zorgverleners écht helpt. De unieke template generator stelt behandelaren in staat hun eigen werkwijze te behouden.

Daarnaast onderscheiden we ons door onze implementatie\- en adoptiekracht. Om Robin goed te laten landen op de werkvloer, zetten wij namelijk adoptie\-Scribes in, psychologiestudenten met ervaring als Scribe. Ze analyseren de werkwijze, installeren Robin en helpen bij het finetunen van gesprekstemplates.

De mogelijkheden voor het verlagen van de administratielast met AI zijn eindeloos. En gaan verder dan het samenvatten van gesprekken alleen. Samen met jou stellen we een road map op voor alle toekomstige administratieve taken die we uit het proces gaan halen met onze techniek.

**Onze missie – wat gaan we samen doen?** 

Wil jij met jouw technische kwaliteiten écht impact maken in de zorg? Dat is namelijk wat wij doen bij Het Scribe Collectief!

Het Scribe Collectief ondersteunt al jaren zorgverleners bij GGZ\-instellingen door de administratieve last te verlichten. De GGZ staat namelijk onder grote druk door de hoge administratielast en een tekort aan zorgverleners. Mensen met psychische klachten worden daardoor geregeld te laat geholpen, met alle gevolgen van dien.

Het Scribe Collectief draagt met haar ruim 150 Scribes bij aan het verlichten van de administratieve lasten. Onze Scribes, psychologiestudenten die administratieve taken overnemen, zorgen al voor efficiëntere zorgprocessen, zodat zorgverleners betere zorg kunnen verlenen.

Dit jaar hebben we een AI\-tool toegevoegd aan onze dienstverlening om een totaaloplossing te bieden voor de zorgorganisaties.

**Jouw profiel**  
Je hebt uiteraard diepgaande kennis van AI, machine learning en full\-stackontwikkeling. Daarnaast ben je een oplossingsgerichte denker die zich niet laat tegenhouden door obstakels. Je kunt technische concepten helder overbrengen en stakeholders meenemen in de ontwikkeling. Je stelt duidelijke doelen en kunt ingewikkelde technische concepten helder en begrijpelijk uitleggen aan niet\-technische stakeholders, waardoor iedereen goed geïnformeerd is.

**Tech\-stack:** Je hebt ervaring en/of interesses in de onderstaande tech\-stack:  
\* Database: MS Azure / SQL / Github  
\* Front\-end: JavaScript  
\* Back\-end: Python  
\* LLMs: Juvoly (speech\-to\-text) en Azure OpenAI (text\-to\-summary)  
\* Authenticatie: Auth0

**Wat wij bieden:**  
\* Een invloedrijke rol in een bedrijf dat de eerste stappen al voorbij is;  
\* Samenwerken met een getalenteerd en gepassioneerd team;  
\* Salarisrange van € 4\.500 tot €6\.000 o.b.v. ervaring;  
\* Mogelijkheid tot participatie in het bedrijf bij wederzijds tevredenheid;  
\* Mogelijkheid om écht impact te maken in een sector waar het echt ergens over gaat;  
\* Budget voor opleiding en ontwikkeling;  
\* Standaard 25 vakantiedagen en bijbehorende vrijheid om zelf je tijd in te delen;  
\* Hybride werken met als charmante uitvalbasis onze kantoorvilla in Bussum (naast het treinstation);

Wil jij tech bouwen die het leven van kwetsbare mensen beter maakt? Stuur je motivatie en CV naar Ruben Buitenhuis via info@hetscribecollectief.nl en vertel waarom jij Robin verder wilt brengen.

Niet op zoek, maar wel geraakt? Laten we praten. Misschien ben jij precies de juiste persoon, zonder dat je het zelf al wist.

Geen one size fits all\-oplossingen, maar maatwerk dat ertoe doet. Je zet niet alleen data pipelines en platforms op, je bouwt aan iets groters: inzichten die écht waarde opleveren voor de klant. En dat doe je niet alleen, maar samen met een team van slimme, betrokken mensen die allemaal hetzelfde willen: impact maken. Iets voor jou? Lees dan snel verder!

**Wat je gaat doen**

Je bouwt aan de stevige datafundamenten waar klanten op kunnen vertrouwen.

* Je ontwerpt en bouwt schaalbare data pipelines en platforms in Microsoft Azure
* Je haalt data op uit bronnen als CRM\-systemen, API’s en logs en maakt het analyse\-klaar
* Je zet Azure\-tools zoals Data Factory, Synapse, Databricks en eventueel Purview in om waardevolle datastromen te creëren
* Je zorgt dat ruwe data wordt omgezet in gestructureerde, betrouwbare datasets
* Je denkt mee over architectuur en performance: future\-proof is het uitgangspunt

**Waarom dit iets voor jou is**

Je wil meer dan alleen ‘de tech fixen’. Je wil snappen wat de klant echt nodig heeft en dáár het verschil maken. Je gelooft dat data pas echt waarde heeft als het goed wordt benut, en daar draag jij aan bij. Jij slaat de brug tussen IT en business: je spreekt beide talen en weet hoe je ze bij elkaar brengt.

Daarnaast werk je graag in een vast team met gelijkgestemde collega’s. Bij ons vind je experts in Data \& AI, Azure Cloud en Agile coaching, en samen til je projecten naar een hoger niveau. En ja, we zien elkaar wekelijks op kantoor, want werken met data is leuk, maar werken met leuke mensen is nog beter.

**Wat maakt deze rol extra tof?**

* Je krijgt een kijkje in de keuken bij verschillende organisaties én levert daar zichtbaar waarde
* Je werkt aan afwisselende projecten die niet alleen technisch uitdagend zijn, maar ook maatschappelijk of strategisch impact maken
* Jij bent geen ‘externe consultant’, maar echt onderdeel van het klantteam – dat is waar we het verschil maken
* Geen standaard onboarding; we kijken waar jij staat en wat je nodig hebt om te groeien
* Je komt in een warme, informele club terecht. We helpen elkaar, lachen veel en vieren successen samen

**Wat neem je mee?** ‍

* Minimaal drie jaar ervaring als Data Engineer, of in een rol zoals BI Developer of Data Specialist met sterke engineering\-focus
* Je bent thuis in Azure en werkt graag met tools als Synapse, Data Factory en eventueel Azure Databricks
* Je hebt ervaring met het ontwikkelen van schaalbare datamodellen, ETL/ELT\-processen en datawarehouses
* Je voelt je als een vis in het water in complexe IT\-omgevingen en werkt soepel samen met serviceteams en andere disciplines
* Je hebt lef. Je stelt vragen, voert het échte gesprek en gaat voor de beste oplossing, niet de snelste fix
* En ja, je kunt een goeie flauwe kantoorgrap op z’n tijd ook waarderen

Voldoe je niet aan alle eisen, maar voel je wél die match? Dan zijn we benieuwd naar jouw verhaal. Overtuig ons!

***For this position, it is required that you speak and write Dutch fluently.***

**Wat kun jij van ons verwachten?**

**Over de organisatie en jouw team**

VluchtelingenWerk Nederland zet zich in voor de belangen van vluchtelingen en asielzoekers, vanaf hun eerste stap in Nederland tot aan volledige integratie. Met een netwerk van duizenden vrijwilligers en honderden betaalde medewerkers beschermen we de rechten van vluchtelingen en bieden we persoonlijke steun, belangenbehartiging en juridische begeleiding.

Je komt terecht in het team Mens \& Organisatie (M\&O) dat uit circa 40 medewerkers bestaat en valt onder de Directie Bedrijfsvoering. Je wordt operationeel aangestuurd door de Senior M\&O Adviseur Betaalde Krachten en hiërarchisch val je onder de Manager M\&O. We werken 50% vanuit het kantoor in Amsterdam en 50% hybride. Jouw team bestaat uit 5 M\&O Adviseurs, een collega Recruiter en een Administratief Medewerker.

Het team recruitment bestaat nog niet zo lang binnen de organisatie, wat de gelegenheid geeft om mee te denken over de processen, zoals het ATS, Diversiteit \& Inclusie of Employer Branding.
