Als AI/ML Engineer bij Inpact ben je onderdeel van een ambitieus Feature Team dat gespecialiseerd is in het bouwen van innovatieve AI\-oplossingen voor de verzekeringssector. Samen met collega\-experts werk je aan geavanceerde technologieën zoals Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) en Deep Learning (DL). Dagelijks werkt het feature team aan Inpact.AI, om verzekeringsprofessionals te helpen om snel en effectief grote hoeveelheden data te verwerken, waaronder polissen, claims, rapporten, e\-mails, PDF’s, afbeeldingen en andere vormen van digitale informatie.

In jouw rol ontwerp, ontwikkel en implementeer je ook nieuwe baanbrekende AI\-modellen en oplossingen—zoals Large Language Models (LLM’s) in combinatie met Retrieval\-Augmented Generation (RAG). Je werkt nauw samen met jouw team aan het optimaliseren van prestaties, verhogen van schaalbaarheid en het realiseren van tastbare resultaten die impact hebben.

**Een normale dag bij Inpact**

Bij Inpact helpen we verzekeraars innoveren, zodat zij tijd en focus overhouden voor het échte werk. Als AI/ML Engineer bouw je mee aan de toekomst van verzekeren. Zonder poespas, mét resultaat. Ja, we zijn ambitieus. Maar hier geen overmatig werken of competitie over functietitels. Grote ego's laten we buiten, grootse plannen verwelkomen we met open armen. Daarom nemen we ook aan op ambitie, in plaats van op ervaring. Ons team bestaat uit een hechte club van 100 nuchtere collega's (waarvan zeker 70 tech\-specialisten) met een passie voor technologie, AI en Data Science. We doen niet aan gedoe, we doen vooral heel normaal terwijl we complexe data omzetten naar waardevolle inzichten voor verzekeraars.

**Zo bouw jij mee aan de toekomst van verzekeren**

We hebben het al genoemd: wij zoeken mensen die gewoon goed werk doen. Geen poespas, wél baanbrekend werk. Geen opschepperij, wél trots op wat we samen bereiken. En als AI/ML Engineer verwachten we dat je:

* Een relevante wo\-opleiding hebt in Data Science, Informatica, Wiskunde, Kunstmatige Intelligentie of Econometrie.
* Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring hebt met frameworks en tools voor machine learning en deep learning, zoals PyTorch en Sklearn.
* Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring hebt met Large Language Models(LLM), waaronder fine\-tuning, prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\-systemen.
* Ervaring met het ontwikkelen en implementeren van machine learning\-oplossingen met grootschalige datasets, inclusief specificatieontwerp, dataverzameling en \-labeling, modelontwikkeling, validatie, implementatie en voortdurende monitoring.
* Ervaring hebt met Python, C\# of Java en source control (Git).
* Een pré als je ervaring hebt met cloudplatforms (bijv. AWS, Azure, GCP).
* Ervaring met data engineering pipelines.
* Proactief, analytisch en samenwerkingsgericht bent.

**Dit vinden wij de normaalste zaak van de wereld**

In één jaar van 10 naar 100 klanten groeien? Dat vinden wij niet gek. Een starter die binnen no\-time haar eigen team aanstuurt? Kan gewoon. En de koffie? Gewoon een kop normale koffie, ténzij je het anders wilt natuurlijk. Wat we nog meer normaal vinden?

* Een competitief salaris
* Prima pensioenregeling waarmee je oude dag gewoon goed geregeld is

* Gewoon vanuit huis kunnen werken, met een onbelaste thuiswerkvergoeding van €2,35 per dag
* 25 verlofdagen op basis van een 40\-urige werkweek
* Een persoonlijk budget en ontwikkelplan om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen via o.a. Udemy Business
* Volop kansen om te groeien, zonder politiek geneuzel

This PhD project offers a unique opportunity to work in an internationally recognized research centre and gain valuable research experience at a top\-ranked European university. As a PhD candidate, you will develop your own research project in consultation with the supervisory team. You will conduct independent and original academic research and report results via peer\-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and ultimately a PhD dissertation. The PhD thesis is to be completed within four years. You are also requested to teach.



You will work with the following supervisory team:


* Dr. Marília Gehrke (co\-promoter)
* Dr. Eedan Amit\-Danhi (co\-promoter)
* Dr. Scott Eldridge (promoter)


The PhD Project  

This PhD project investigates disinformation at the intersections of gender, visual communication, and political discourse. It studies how women politicians’ intersectional identities are targeted in false and misleading content. As generative AI tools are becoming more accessible and often materialize as deepfakes, disinformation campaigns’ visual and multimodal aspects pose new challenges for political representation and democratic discourse. Through an interdisciplinary approach combining political communication and media studies with a focus on gender and visual disinformation, this PhD project will examine the distinguishing features of gendered multimodal disinformation, its perception by audiences, and its impact on women in the political sphere targeted by it.



Methodologically, research in this project employs qualitative methods, incorporating a systematic literature review, multimodal discourse analysis, media diaries, focus groups, and in\-depth interviews with women who have been targeted by disinformation campaigns. This comprehensive approach contributes to a better understanding of how disinformation campaigns target women in the political context, potentially discouraging them from pursuing public careers. This is a particular concern given that women are underrepresented in prominent political positions, holding head\-of\-state positions in only 23% of countries. When they do reach these positions of power, women politicians are often subject to backlash when they do not meet gender\-stereotypical expectations.



You will be asked to


* Develop your own research project in consultation with the associated supervisors.
* Conduct independent and original academic research.
* Report results via peer\-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and ultimately a PhD dissertation.
* Conduct a total of 0\.4 FTE teaching spread over the second, third, and fourth years of your appointment.
* Complete the PhD in the specified timeframe, namely four years.
* Contribute to scientific and public engagement.


Note: This call does not specify the geographical scope of this PhD project; options include data collection related to Latin America, the United States/Canada, Central/Northern Europe, or the Levant. The final focus of empirical work will be decided based on the expertise and interest of the PhD candidate in consultation with the supervisory team. Consider this when preparing your research proposal (for further guidance, see the section “Application”).

This fully funded position offers the opportunity to conduct cutting\-edge research, publish in top journals, and engage in teaching activities. You’ll join a dynamic, international academic community with excellent research facilities and professional development opportunities.



The PhD Project  

Modal verbs like can or must have various meanings: In a sentence “You must close the door”, must expresses an obligation, while in “I must have left my notebook upstairs”, must expresses an inference. This ambiguity occurs in half of the world’s languages. How confusing is this ambiguity, and how do children resolve it? While previous studies approached these questions by annotating large amounts of language produced by adults or children, we approach the question by employing computational models that learn by finding patterns in language data. Can they learn the different modal meanings simply by paying attention to what they “hear”? Or do they need to come prepared with certain expectations? By using computational models (including probabilistic models and neural language models), we will be able to answer these types of questions. In addition, our project will benefit computational research on language modeling, as our findings will aid the understanding of modal verbs learning in modern neural language models, ultimately contributing to the design of better models.



You will be asked to


* Carry out academic research in linguistics / computational linguistics / language acquisition, as specified in the project description.
* Prepare conference and research papers, conference presentations, and dissertation chapters.
* Present research findings at national and international conferences, workshops, internal seminars.

* Complete the PhD in the specified timeframe (4 years).
* Participate in teaching activities in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th year.

=================================================================

#### **Job description**


The Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC) is looking for a PhD candidate to work on a 4\-year project “Control and Generative AI for Human Digital Twin”. Controlling a digital twin of the human body with hundreds of muscles and joints to generate realistic human motion, e.g., walking, running, or jumping, is a challenging control problem. This is essential for conducting human\-involved experiments in silico, significantly reducing the experimental cost in various applications, e.g., understanding human motor skills, designing rehabilitation programs, and designing assistive devices such as exoskeletons and prostheses.

  


Due to the complexity of human digital twin, this project will focus on developing novel control methods by exploiting reinforcement learning (RL) and generative AI. The developed approaches will be used for generating complex human motion across different populations, e.g., healthy individuals, individuals with mobility impairments, and individuals wearing assistive devices. While the primary focus of this project is on healthcare, the results will also have a profound impact on gaming, virtual reality, animation, and humanoid robotics. Experiments for collecting human motion data will be performed using a motion capture system in our Lab.

  


This research project allows you to gradually build your own research profile according to your interests, while remaining within the project’s goals. You will be responsible for the typical scientific research workflow: motivating the problem, identifying the main methodological shortcomings in literature, developing novel methods in RL and generative AI and novel models for human body, planning and executing experiments, and reporting findings in articles to be published at top venues. Periodic meetings, feedback, and international/national collaborations will ensure the success of your degree and the project overall.

  


#### **Job requirements**


* We are looking for a candidate with a master's degree in engineering, robotics, computer science, mathematics, or other related fields (must have been awarded by a mutually agreed starting date of the PhD).
* The candidate should have a strong transcript of records.
* Programming skills, e.g., Python or others, is a plus.
