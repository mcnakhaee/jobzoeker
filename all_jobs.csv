For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to preempt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

From our people who are caring, candid, and impact-driven to our business, which is innovative and rooted in science, we believe that being proudly unique, determined to be our best, and authentic is essential to fulfilling our purpose.
The role
Join our dynamic bioinformatics team at Genmab as a student data engineer, where you will play a crucial role in supporting our scientists by creating and managing sophisticated data architectures aligned with FAIR principles. In this position, you will focus on integrating real-world clinical and molecular data into graph database models to facilitate complex data analysis and enable innovative research methodologies.

This internship offers a unique opportunity to develop expertise in data engineering technologies, contribute to bioinformatics solutions, and directly impact our research in developing groundbreaking therapeutic strategies. Your work will support essential projects aimed at enhancing drug discovery and development processes, fostering your growth as a data scientist and making a meaningful impact in the field of biomedicine.*Project Background*
Translational research leverages real-world data sets to study how patients respond to cancer treatments. This research often involves integrating complex and non-standardized molecular and clinical data. Clinical datasets, designed to answer specific scientific questions, typically lack detailed data granularity, making exploration challenging. Understanding the clinical data model is crucial to selecting the appropriate variables for analysis.
This project proposes the use of graph databases to overcome these challenges by organizing data into a flexible, multidimensional structure that facilitates easier access and more intuitive querying. Graph databases, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, allow for the discovery of implicit relationships within the data that traditional table-based databases might miss. Through this initiative, we aim to develop and evaluate AI-driven querying techniques using natural language, enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets in translational research.
Responsibilities* Technology Exploration: Investigate various graph database technologies and their applicability to managing clinical data, assessing their strengths and limitations in this domain.
* Data Model Comparison: Compare and analyze the data structures of graph and relational databases to identify the most effective frameworks for clinical data.
* Pilot Database Development: Design and implement a prototype database focused on the standardization of clinical real-world data, ensuring it supports robust data integration and access.
* Natural Language Query Development: Create methods to enable querying of graph databases using natural language, employing advanced AI technologies to facilitate intuitive data interactions.
* Findings Presentation: Regularly present progress and insights during team meetings, ensuring clear communication of developments and challenges.
* Bonus Objective: Develop a user interface that enables easy querying, and effective visualization and presentation of results from the database.


Requirements* Education: You are a BSc/MSc student in bioinformatics, computational biology or a related field.
* Technical skills: Demonstrated strong technical skills, with substantial experience in Python programming. Familiarity with AWS is an added advantage.
* Soft skills: Comfortable with pioneering research and creative processes; scientific thinking and connecting that to technical requirements.


About You* You are passionate about our purpose and genuinely care about our mission to transform the lives of patients through innovative cancer treatment
* You bring rigor and excellence to all that you do. You are a fierce believer in our rooted-in-science approach to problem-solving
* You are a generous collaborator who can work in teams with diverse backgrounds
* You are determined to do and be your best and take pride in enabling the best work of others on the team
* You are not afraid to grapple with the unknown and be innovative
* You have experience working in a fast-growing, dynamic company (or a strong desire to)
* You work hard and are not afraid to have a little fun while you do so

Are you fascinated by sustainability issues and do you have experience and affinity with researching the effects of land use on climate? Then we are looking for you!***  

  

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research into monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).  

  

While the team’s main focus is on forests we also conduct research into the role of land use and forest management in greenhouse gas emissions and removals in a broader context involving the whole LULUCF sector, including other land uses. Team members are responsible for the compilation of the national greenhouse gas inventory for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. For this we develop and work with geographically explicit instruments (such as models and monitoring) that can be used to determine the effects of the management or change in land use of forests, cropland, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other land. We closely collaborate with other experts on land use and soil at Wageningen Environmental Research and external research institutes to bring together all required information for the LULUCF monitoring.  

  

We use our knowledge and tools to draw up the international (Climate Convention, Paris Agreement, EU) and national (Climate and Energy Outlook) reports of greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. With our science-based expertise we also support the development and evaluation of climate policy of the Dutch government and European Commission. For instance, we currently support the European Commission in drafting the methodologies for certification of carbon removals in forests, wetlands and agricultural soils (carbon farming).  

  

**Your duties and responsibilities:**  

As LULUCF researcher you will contribute to further improving our methodologies for calculating carbon stock changes towards higher Tier levels according to the IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. This will involve the compilation and collection of new emission factors for carbon stock changes in living biomass, dead organic matter or soils and/or emissions of methane or nitrous oxide due to land use or land use change.  

  

Depending on your expertise you will be responsible for the improvements for several land use categories covered by the LULUCF sector and/or the further development of spatially explicit approaches. You also contribute to the acquisition of new externally funded projects.  

  

**You will work here**  

You will be placed in the team SFE of WENR, based at the Wageningen Campus of Wageningen University and Research, but you will also collaborate intensively with colleagues in other teams at WENR as well as with researchers in other research institutes in the Netherlands and internationally.  

  

You will be working in an enthusiastic team of about 24 colleagues working on options for conservation, restoration, development and sustainable use of trees and forests from an ecological perspective. We focus on the way in which policy, management and climate affect ecological processes and what their consequences are for climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and restoration, delivery of ecosystem services and other specific policy goals.

Read the 5 reasons why your future colleagues enjoy working at WUR and watch the video below to get an idea of our green campus!

**Omschrijving**
----------------


The Soil Physics and Land Management chair group at Wageningen University and Research is seeking a postdoc researcher in hydrological modelling who will be responsible for the numerical modelling work in project RESTARTIN: “Restructuring and enhancing strategies with a transformative approach for integrated water disaster management in India and the Netherlands”. This work will involve not only the modelling itself, but also the use of high-resolution satellite imagery to assess vegetation water conditions for calibration, the design of land-use change scenarios (eventually with modelling), and interactions with stakeholders and socioeconomic researchers to translate potential adaptation options into practice.  

Your duties and responsibilities include:

+ apply a surface and groundwater model to several regions in the Netherlands (Limburg, Brabant and Holland);
+ assess climate change scenarios and design compatible land-use scenarios;
+ assess the impact of climate change on flood and drought conditions;
+ test potential adaptation options in coordination with stakeholders;
+ some involvement in related educational activities is possible.
**You will work here**  

You will work in project RESTARTIN, jointly funded by NWO and DST-India. Most of the work will be developed within the Soil Physics and Land Management chair group in WUR. But it will be closely coordinated with researchers at IHE-Delft working on detailed risk assessment and socioeconomic analysis. It will also be closely linked with similar activities being performed by Indian researchers in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra. Some travelling to India is therefore expected.


The intended starting date of this position is 1 September 2024.

**Functie-eisen**
-----------------


You hold a PhD degree in hydro(geo)logy, environmental sciences or equivalent. You also possess:

+ strong and broad conceptual and methodological knowledge of hydrology at the soil-water-plant and watershed scales, including relevant numerical models (e.g., HEC-HMS/RAS, SWMM, HBV, SWAT, SHE, VIC, MODFLOW, CATHY, HGS, FEFLOW, DSSAT, etc.), and model calibration/validation techniques;
+ in-depth experience with GIS packages (e.g., ArcGIS, Qgis) and advanced data analysis techniques;
+ in-depth experience with scripting in R, MATLAB, Python, FORTRAN, etc.;
+ experience in scientific writing, conducting research, and a publication record in hydrology;
+ ability to work independently and to take ownership of the assigned tasks, including making independent decisions on implementation details.

We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”



Unique to this job  

We are an international, dynamic, highly motivated team of scientists at different stages of our careers with a strong drive to push research for the benefit of Public Health. We combine expertise in immunology, virology, and bioinformatics and believe in the strength of collaboration and working together as a team.

**Job Description:**

**IT Internship: GenAI, Machine Learning and Computer Vision**
==============================================================


Are you a student looking to launch your Information Technology career? If so, then UPS is the place for you! We will give you the opportunity to work on practical business problem in the Logistic industry using Digitization techniques and Artificial Intelligence.


UPS is a leader in Information Technology. If you are a highly motivated student working on a degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, Mathematics, Engineering, Business, Human Resources, Finance, or a related degree, then UPS is a great place for you to start your career.


Explore your next opportunity at a Global Fortune 500 organization. Envision innovative possibilities, experience our rewarding culture, and work with talented teams that help you excel every day. We know what it takes to lead UPS into tomorrow, – people with a unique combination of skills and passion. If you have the qualities and drive to lead yourself then this role will help you to cultivate your skills and take you to the next level. As a part of the internship, you will have opportunity to learn and develop the following business cases:

**Document Indexing (DOCIDX)**


Indexing scanned documents based on an embedded barcode of any type like CODE39, QR... is essential for any later processing, such as storage and retrieval, distribution to other departments or customer, and other back-office processing. We would like you to work on creating a reusable interface to index scanned documents in bulk, easily customizable for any environment and task.

**Package Type Detection (PKGDCT)**


UPS operates a large number of automated package-processing facilities. Not all packages processed have the perfect cube shape and size. We need to detect the shape of the packages (e.g., envelope, regular box, big size, irregular…) so that they are processed with the care required for each type, or even detect warning conditions like broken packages or liquid leaks.

**Job Description:**


As a computer vision scientist, you will review the current process flow the cases for image acquisition, either paper-based or digital documents for the case #1 and explore different options to capture package images from operational facilities to be later processed in case #2. For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to pre-empt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

**This position requires one or more of the following technical or business skills:**

* Proficiency in computer vision tools and algorithms.
* Strong mathematical skills to help collect, measure, organize and analyse data
* Knowledge of programming languages like SQL, Oracle, R, MATLAB, Java, and Python
* Technical proficiency regarding database design development, data models, techniques for data mining, and segmentation

Experience in reporting/creating dashboards with Power BI, Looker, programming (Javascript, XML, or ETL frameworks), databases, and working with Google Cloud Platform  
* 

  

**This position requires one or more of the following soft skills:**

* Effective communication
* Responsibility
* Accountability
* Adaptability
* Willingness/eagerness to learn.
* Independently
* Resiliency
* Problem-solving skills

**What is expected from you (and from the University)?**

* Data Privacy and Confidentiality, that will be ensured by signing the Non-Disclosure Agreement with UPS
* Full participation in all the project steps
* Take-up assignments and tasks and deliver them with quality and speed according to Agile project timeline
* Handover all deliverables (project documentation, software and algorithms developed) to UPS as Intellectual Property and not to be used outside the internship program
* At the end of the internship the intern will be given the opportunity to present results to the Europe IT management team (optional), UPS Mentor and University coach

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-------------------


Join us – we look forward to welcoming you to our Self-Organizing Soft Matter Research Group at Eindhoven University of Technology!


We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Researcher with a passion for quantitative microscopy and physical chemistry of self-assembling materials to join our team to image the behavior of ice-interactive biomaterials on ice with single-molecule resolution. The goal of your project is to develop and use state-of-the-art microscopy tools and quantitative image analysis approaches to discover the physical principles underpinning the activity of novel ice-interactive biomaterials and to tune their interaction with ice to modulate activity as desired.


Key Responsibilities:


* Conduct high-quality, curiosity-driven, original, and independent research focusing on quantitative imaging and super-resolution microscopy of self-assembling materials
* Collaborate with a multi-disciplinary and international team of researchers
* Present research findings at conferences and publish in top-tier scientific journals
* Mentor and support junior researchers in the lab


The formation and growth of ice during freezing, storage, and/or thawing of cryopreserved materials limits the potential of cryopreservation technology for the long-term storage of sensitive materials, such as cells, tissues, and organs. Our group aims to unravel how biological and engineered ice-interactive materials function so that we can create customized chemical cryoprotectants for biomedical and other applications. Recently, we reported sub-zero super-resolution microscopy experiments which allowed us to study for the first time the interfacial dynamics of ice-bound ice-binding proteins at the single molecule level (see PNAS publication for more information). In this project you will build upon these pioneering experiments. You will image the interaction with ice of a novel class of engineered ice-interactive materials at the single molecule level to advance our understanding of how their structure and properties impact their ability to modulate ice crystal formation and growth. In this exciting role, you will work in a vibrant and international research group aiming to advance molecular insight into the working mechanism of novel ice-interactive materials for biomedical applications.

Are you an ambitious bioinformatician with a solid background in omics data analysis and experience in the field of immunology and/or infectious disease research? Then this bioinformatician position is the job for you!



Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work.

Join us on our journey as Splunk Solution Engineer, and enjoy a culture of inclusiveness, disruption, and fun while selling smart and winning big.
What’s the role of a Solution Engineer at Splunk?* You will technically own, discover, position, prove and deliver the key technical elements of a sales cycle to achieve a ‘technical win’ within large scale and complex customer environments. You’ll use a range of communication styles, a range of technology skills and experiences and a range of soft skills and people skills to develop trust relationships with both your sales colleagues and your customers.
* You will be an advocate and ambassador for Splunk through your professional social media, industry and marketing events and supporting pipeline generation activities
* You will collaborate with your customer contacts, and build them into Splunk champions, by helping them to understand how Splunk can help them to solve some of their most challenging problems and help them achieve their objectives.


Responsibilities:* Ability to demonstrate Splunk products and services to customers on site, remotely via webinar sessions, and at field events such as conferences and trade shows.
* Establish and maintain strong relationships throughout the sales cycle with all levels within the customer.

* Technically Astute: You enjoy the detail, even if you don’t always need to express it. You have a thirst for up-to-date knowledge of the technologies and solutions that businesses use to be successful as they transform.
* Confidence: But not arrogant – you have the confidence that comes from the knowledge that your product is rock solid, and the ability to transmit this confidence to a customer. That means you might sit down with a customer already using your product to show them how they might use it even better!
* Business Savvy: You understand how businesses are organized, how they achieve their desired results, what challenges they are likely to face, what solutions they need and what transformations they could make with your solutions.
* A growth mindset: You build in time to develop your skills, knowledge, experience or capabilities. You look beyond the current opportunity towards the wider set of opportunities that could exist in a prospect.
* A Collaborator: You understand that selling is a team game, so you spend time developing your network of colleagues and partners to achieve your success – and theirs.
* Competitive: If you’re in it, you want to win it!
* Fun: Getting the job done and enjoying & generating fun don’t need to be mutually exclusive.
* The candidate must be based in the Netherlands and be fluent in Dutch and English.


Helpful technical skills or experience (not all required, but consider how Splunk could benefit from your background)* Domain knowledge and experience in any of the following areas: IT infrastructure, Cloud Technologies, Application Delivery, Business Analytics or Log Management

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



Afdeling Beleidsinformatie zorgt ervoor dat de vier directies binnen het DG Digitalisering en Overheidsorganisaties (DGDDOO) de juiste informatie tot hun beschikking hebben om effectief beleid te voeren. Dat doen we door de juiste gegevens binnen de Rijksoverheid samen te brengen en te analyseren. Om dit goed te kunnen doen onderhouden we nauw contact met de verschillende departementale contactpersonen.  

We geven gevraagd en ongevraagd advies aan onze beleidscollega's op basis van verkregen inzichten. We maken terugkerende rapportages zoals de Jaarrapportage Bedrijfsvoering Rijk, maar doen ook ad hoc analyses of uitgebreider onderzoek. We zijn werkzaam op de verschillende terreinen van bedrijfsvoering zoals inkoop, duurzaamheid, ICT, personeel, facilitair en huisvesting.


De zes directies van het DG Digitalisering en Overheidsorganisaties (DGDOO) die de afdeling ondersteunt zijn: Digitale Overheid (DO), Digitale Samenleving (DS), CIO Rijk, Programma Open Overheid, Ambtenaar en Organisatie (AO), en Inkoop-, Facilitair en Huisvestingsbeleid Rijk (IFHR).



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.

Ben je enthousiast om een expert te worden in de relatie tussen chemische stoffen en cardiometabool risico en wil je meewerken aan een groot internationaal citizen science project? Dan is deze promovendus-positie wellicht een goede match voor jou!


**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


In dit project ben je verantwoordelijk voor de uitvoering en coördinatie van blootstellingsonderzoek naar chemische stoffen binnen een groot Europees citizen science project van Exposome-NL: de Exposoom Panelstudie.


Om te begrijpen wat de impact van het exposoom op onze gezondheid is, verzamelen, meten en analyseren we gedetailleerde informatie over de omgeving waarin we wonen, werken en recreëren. Een aantal sensoren (GPS-tracking, luchtkwaliteit, fysieke activiteit), diverse tools en een app zijn ontwikkeld om dit mogelijk te maken. Zo’n 4000 burgerwetenschappers uit Nederland, Zwitserland, Spanje, Griekenland en Polen hebben het afgelopen jaar gegevens verzameld. Het komende jaar zullen de Nederlandse deelnemers diverse metingen herhalen.


Wat ga je doen?


* Data verzamelen: je monitort de Nederlandse data die via de burgerwetenschappers binnenkomt. In samenwerking met ons datamanagement team ga je aan de slag met de opslag, opschoning en het verwerken van de deelnemersdata.
* Nieuwe metingen: in samenwerking met de deelnemers bedenk en ontwikkel je nieuwe metingen.
* Analyseren: met de al verzamelde en nieuwe gegevens uit de Exposoom Panelstudie zal je analyses uitvoeren om het verband tussen blootstelling aan chemische stoffen, de fysieke leefomgeving en cardiometabool risico te onderzoeken.
* Je ondersteunt de onderzoeksassistent bij veldwerk rondom huidige en toekomstige deelnemers.


Deze promovendus-positie is gehuisvest bij de afdeling One Health Chemical van het Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS). Je werkt in een levendige en inspirerende onderzoeksomgeving, met een team van onderzoekers, studenten, datamanagers, projectmanagers en communicatieprofessionals. Je werkt daarnaast nauw samen met onderzoekers van het Amsterdam AMC. Zij brengen binnen de Exposoom Panelstudie de relatie tussen de voedselomgeving, eetgedrag en cardiometabool risico in kaart.


Als team geven we prioriteit aan effectieve samenwerking, voortdurende feedback en zowel professionele als persoonlijke ontwikkeling.


**Wat breng je mee?**
---------------------


Je bent geïnteresseerd in blootstellingsonderzoek naar chemische stoffen en hebt een leergierige en onderzoekende houding. Je wilt jezelf persoonlijk en professioneel ontwikkelen. Je maakt gebruik van je goede samenwerkings- en communicatieve vaardigheden. Specifiek heb je:


* (bijna) een masterdiploma in epidemiologie, gezondheidswetenschappen of een verwant vakgebied (bijvoorbeeld data science, toxicologie, exposure science);
* ervaring met het uitvoeren van epidemiologische analyses;
* vaardigheden in het gebruik van statistische software (zoals SPSS of R).


Daarnaast spreek en schrijf je uitstekend Nederlands. Omdat een deel van het onderzoek wordt uitgevoerd in samenwerking met internationale collega’s, is het belangrijk dat je het Engels voldoende beheerst.


**Wat bieden wij?**
-------------------


Wij bieden:


* een functie voor vier jaar;
* een werkweek van 36 tot 40 uur met een bruto maandsalaris van minimaal € 2.770,- tot maximaal € 3.539,- bij een fulltime dienstverband (schaal P van de cao Nederlandse Universiteiten);

The institute aims to provide the highest level of care for all children with cancer and has the ambition to cure all children of cancer and improve quality of life. The center brings together the best possible care and scientific research, creating a unique interdisciplinary institute for pediatric oncology in Europe.


**Research project**



In cancer, a correct and timely diagnosis is essential in order to start the optimal treatment. For solid tumors the initial diagnosis is established on the basis of morphology and immunohistochemistry. However, an increasing number of tumor entities require molecular profiling of the tumor, based on which a treatment protocol is chosen. This molecular profiling can take up to 14 days, thereby delaying the start of treatment. We have recently demonstrated the potential of nanopore methylation sequencing-based classification in the diagnostics of CNS tumors, where we’ve developed methodology to acquire a molecular diagnosis while the patient is in surgery (Vermeulen et al., Nature 2023). In the current project the goal is to extend this technology to the domain of solid tumors in order to ultimately reduce time to molecular diagnosis from 14 days down to 24 hours.



This is a 4-year project that is subsidized by KiKa. As a PhD student in this project you will be in charge of developing artificial intelligence models that work with nanopore sequencing data in order to classify diagnostic samples of solid tumors into the correct tumor types. You will be based both in the Princess Maxima Center and in the University Medical Center Utrecht. This combination allows close collaboration with both the clinical experts on pediatric oncology in the Princess Maxima Center and the artificial intelligence experts in the University Medical Center Utrecht.


**Profile**



We are looking for an enthusiastic, curious PhD candidate with a background in (molecular) biology who is eager to learn, has good organizational skills and has experience with artificial intelligence. You are creative and think out-of-the box. You enjoy fundamental research, but are also driven to bring your research into clinical care. You work well in a dynamic environment.


**Qualifications**


* Master’s degree in (molecular) biology
* Experience with artificial intelligence, preferably neural networks
* Experience in programming in python and/or R
* Demonstrated experience in research
* Interest in translational childhood cancer research
* You enjoy working in and contributing to a multidisciplinary team


**The Kester and the De Ridder Groups**



This project is a collaboration between the Kester research group in the Princess Maxima Center for pediatric oncology and the de Ridder research group in the University Medical Center Utrecht. The Kester research group is embedded within the diagnostic laboratory of the Princess Maxima Center and focusses on translational research that will improve diagnostics for pediatric oncology patients. The De Ridder group focusses on the development of artificial intelligence algorithms that can directly have an impact on patient care. This project is at the interplay between research on artificial intelligence models and the implementation of those models in actual patient care.


**Our offer**



We offer you a challenging position within a unique pediatric oncology center in the Netherlands and Europe. You will have the opportunity to engage in the entire scope of translational research on childhood cancer. It is also possible to actively contribute to the overarching project, by generating and testing your own research hypotheses. You will start on a temporary position for 36 hours per week for the duration of one year, which –upon satisfactory completion of the first year- will be extended to a four-year PhD trajectory. Your gross monthly salary will start in FWG 45-6 with a salary of €3.523,- gross a month for a fulltime working week (36 hours). You also receive 8,33% holiday allowance and 8,33 % end-of-year bonus. The Princess Máxima Center operates according to the collective labor agreement ‘cao ziekenhuizen’.

**ABOUT US**

The Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) is seeking a creative and entrepreneurial candidate to join its offices in Groningen or Nairobi as a Climate Change Adaptation Economist.  



  

GCA is a leading international organization dedicated to addressing climate change and promoting adaptation action for resilient development. We collaborate with governments, International Financial Institutions (IFIs), businesses, and communities to develop and implement innovative solutions that strengthen resilience and support adaptation to climate change impacts.  



  

At GCA, you’ll contribute to transformative projects that make a lasting impact on global climate resilience. You’ll have the freedom to innovate and the support to bring your bold ideas to life. If you’re excited about creating meaningful change and building a sustainable future, we’d love to have you on our team.

GCA’s strategy in Africa is implemented under the flagship Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP), launched by GCA and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to scale up adaptation efforts and mobilize finance for climate-resilient development in Africa. To date, GCA has integrated adaptation solutions into $9 billion worth of investments funded by IFIs across Africa. GCA’s work under the AAAP focuses on four pillars where investments in adaptation and resilience building can yield high economic dividends for African nations, including: Food security; Infrastructure and Nature-based Solutions; Youth entrepreneurship and adaptation jobs; and Adaptation finance.  



  

The R4I team conducts research to support GCA’s programmatic work and develops academic and training programs on adaptation to empower scholars and professionals as well as serving as an adaptation incubator to globalize the exchange of adaptation knowledge which would have otherwise remained geographically constrained. The three R4I business lines designed for program support and expanding knowledge networks are:

* **Capacity Enhancement and Knowledge Dissemination:** Facilitating efforts to disseminate knowledge and foster capacity building through actionable adaptation initiatives, tapping into epistemic networks and monitoring state and trends in adaptation.

 **PROFILE**

You support critical economic and environmental modeling related to climate change, its impacts, and the effectiveness of adaptation policies.  



  

Your focus will be on developing systems-based methodologies and tools for sustainable and resilient infrastructure development (from systems to asset level) in response to climate adaptation needs and support related program work. You will delve into the critical linkages between infrastructure disruption and broader societal dimensions such as food security, livelihoods, and overall wellbeing. Your expertise will be key in identifying how infrastructure resilience directly affects international trade, national economies and community resilience, uncovering complex interdependencies and providing actionable insights for resilience strategies. Through your research you will play a significant role in comprehending and articulating the effects that infrastructure disruption or development can have on societal stability and progress with respect to climate adaptation.  



  

Working directly with the Senior Economist and the R4I team, you will collaborate closely with GCA program teams. Reporting to the R4I Manager, your responsibilities will include:


**Economic Modeling and Analysis:**

* Manage and analyze large datasets, ensuring accuracy and relevance to the research questions.
* Contribute to the preparation of policy briefs and reports that articulate the economic rationale for climate adaptation strategies.
* Support the Senior Economist in advising on policy development, incorporating economic principles into practical adaptation actions.

**Collaboration and Communication:**


* Work collaboratively with other GCA program team members from other disciplines to ensure economic analysis is integrated with environmental and social research.
* Communicate complex economic concepts and results to non-experts, including policymakers, stakeholders, and team members.

**Support to R4I Program Management, Reporting and Coordination:**


* Undertake and/or assist the R4I Manager in the coordination of project activities, ensuring that timelines and deliverables are met.

-----------------


The section Ecology & Evolution, part of the Amsterdam Institute for Life and Environment (A-LIFE) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam invites applications for an ambitious PhD position that will combine innovative bioinformatics and genomic tools to study captive and wild red panda genomes for conservation. Are you interested? Keep reading and apply at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam!


Understanding the population structure of (sub)species is crucial for both wildlife conservation and effective population management of back-up populations in zoos, given the potential harm hybridization poses to the reintroduction potential of zoo animals. The red panda (*Ailurus fulgens*) is an endangered mammal with only 2,500 to 10,000 individuals in the wild. Debate is ongoing whether the species should be split into two distinct species: *Ailurus fulgens fulgens* and *Ailurus fulgens styani.* This project aims to assess the genetic health of the worldwide zoo population and determine the taxonomic origin of its founders. Additionally, the candidate will explore genomic compatibility between populations to predict the potential effect of hybridization. In collaboration with the international studbook keeper of the red panda zoo population, based at Rotterdam zoo, we will use long- and short read whole genome sequence data from key individuals from the zoo population with an additional reference dataset of re-sequenced wild individuals. This project will develop a genomics-informed framework for conservation and reintroduction of red pandas, and could potentially set a new standard for the field of conservation genomics.


The successful applicant will bring together the expertise of Dr. Mirte Bosse, who is in the forefront of the exciting new field of conservation genomics, and Janno Weerman, who is the international studbook keeper of the worldwide zoo population of red pandas. The PhD candidate will be embedded in the Ecology&Evolution group at the VU in close collaboration with Rotterdam Zoo and the Animal Breeding and Genomics group of Wageningen University. The candidate will have the opportunity to frequently work from Rotterdam Zoo, and will engage in a research network with international academic partners, zoos and NGOs.

The Faculty of Science and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) are looking for:

**PhD candidate | Environmental impact assessment of pollution at the ecosystem level (0.8-1.0 fte)**

**Vacancy number: (14994)**


**Background**


The freshwater system and its adjacent ecosystems host countless species because of their need of water. These are the earths’ natural capital and drivers of many ecosystem services we humans depend on. At the same time, the presence and effects of anthropogenic stress in the aquatic environment are multitude and ubiquitous. These include the omnipresence of chemical pollution such as the use of agricultural chemicals.


To relatively quickly assess the impacts of chemicals a standard risk assessment framework is in place. While valuable, the frameworks often lacks ecological realism. Researchers from Leiden University therefore experiment in outdoor freshwater experimental systems with natural food webs such as the “Levend Lab” (EN: “Living Lab”, https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/livinglab) to identify how biodiversity responds to the impacts of pesticides, fertilizers, invasive species and nanomaterials.


Using ecological theory, a large array of different experimental and statistical analytical methods are currently in practice to perform and analyze such experiments. The key challenge for the PhD candidate is to test these different forms of experimental and statistical analytical methods to identify stressor - ecosystem function relationships. The research will likely entail measuring different forms of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functionality followed by statistical modelling to infer causality of stressor impacts and their propagation through the ecosystem.


We invite prospective candidates to unravel the intricate network of species interactions between each other and their environment. The candidate will use new analytical methods and develops models and interpretation scenarios to identify how pollution impacts species and their role in ecosystem functionality.

**Key tasks:**

* *Perform* mesocosm pollution experiments in the ‘Levend Lab’ facility of Leiden University
* *Further develop* and test different types of statistical analyses at the community to ecosystem level
* *Advance* ecological theory by identifying the anthropological and natural drivers of species and their roles in ecosystems

**Selection criteria:**

* You should have an M.Sc. in a relevant field (environmental science, biology, ecology and/or ecotoxicology), but we also consider candidates from other related scientific fields.
* Experience with experimental field and laboratory skills and (aquatic) organism identifications are highly valued
* Strong background and interest in statistical analyses, data management, visualization and coding skills (in R, but Python also applies) is highly valued.
* You must be proficient in spoken and written English.
* You are a team player and have a collaborative attitude.


**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,800 staff and almost 6,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 150 FTE (including postdocs and PhD candidates) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

We offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 4 years based on performance. Salary ranges from € 2.770 gross per month in the first year to € 3.539 gross per month in the fourth year based on a full-time position (pay scale P in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities).


Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development and sabbatical leave. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break.


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website. Female researchers are also welcomed to join the Researchers In Science for Equality network of the Faculty if Science (rise.nu).

Dit doen we door te werken aan baanbrekend onderzoek en innovatie gebundeld in 10 internationaal toonaangevende onderzoeks flagships.  

  

Het flaghship PROTECt ME (Proactive Technology-supported Prevention and Mental Health in Adolescence) richt zich op het mentale welzijn van jongeren. Je komt te werken binnen de afdeling Kinder-en Jeugdpsychiatrie/psychologie van het Erasmus MC, een van de toonaangevende partners van het flaghship PROTECt ME. De missie van dit programma is het optimaliseren van het welzijn van alle jongeren, door deze problemen proactief aan te pakken, van genezing naar zorg te gaan, en emotionele problemen op te sporen voordat ze de kop opsteken en levens negatief beïnvloeden.  

  

Als promovendus ga je werken aan het beter identificeren van dynamische risicofactoren van emotionele problemen met behulp van geavanceerde realtime maatregelen, smartphone- en draagbare technologie en datamodellering. Onderdeel van dit project is het opzetten en uitvoeren van een nieuw onderzoek onder adolescenten met behulp van diverse innovatieve eHealth instrumenten. Je begeleidt een team studenten dat aan dit nieuwe onderzoek werkt. Samenwerking binnen ons multidisciplinaire team met clinici, datawetenschappers, industrieel ontwerp, machine learning en AI-experts zal van cruciaal belang zijn om onze doelen te bereiken.  

  

Over PROTECt ME:  

Maatschappelijk probleem. 13-25% van de Nederlandse jongeren (12-25 jaar) lijdt aan depressie of angst. Dergelijke mentale gezondheidsproblemen hebben langdurige negatieve gevolgen, waaronder schooluitval, een slechtere lichamelijke gezondheid en een grotere ongelijkheid. Mentale gezondheidsproblemen kosten de Nederlandse samenleving jaarlijks 2 miljard euro. Adequate en tijdige identificatie en behandeling zijn momenteel onmogelijk vanwege lange wachtlijsten, tijdrovende monitoringprocedures en het gebrek aan gepersonaliseerde, proactieve preventiestrategieën. Daarom zijn systematische veranderingen in onze benadering van de geestelijke gezondheidszorg voor jongeren hard nodig.  

  

Wetenschappelijke ambitie: Het welzijn van Nederlandse jongeren van 12 tot 25 jaar optimaliseren door:


* (WP 1) het verbeteren van de vroege identificatie van mentale gezondheidsproblemen, met behulp van geavanceerde realtime maatregelen, smartphone- en draagbare technologie, en datamodellering;
* (WP 2) het verbeteren van de besluitvorming over wie welke interventie nodig heeft en wanneer, door professionele expertise te combineren met kunstmatige intelligentie;
* (WP 3) het creëren en evalueren van nieuwe technologiegedreven proactieve interventies (bijv. eHealth). Onze geïntegreerde aanpak betrekt belanghebbenden en eindgebruikers bij elke stap (WP 4)

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!



One very important note….don't hold back! Even if you think you don't meet 100% of the criteria listed in this job role, we still encourage you to apply. We believe that everyone should have equal access to opportunities and want to ensure we provide an inclusive experience, so do let us know if there is anything else we can do to support your application process.

----------------


Are you passionate about investigating workforce challenges from the perspective of psychology, health sciences and medicine? Are you interested in applying these disciplines in clarifying risks of physicians’ stress to their work performance in providing patient care? If so, we invite you to join our team as a PhD student to unravel the impact of job demands, job resources and physicians’ work stress on diagnostic errors in emergency medicine.


**Job description**
-------------------


Emergency medicine physicians see patients who urgently need care. One of their key tasks is to determine the severity of the situation and identify possible diagnoses. This diagnostic process is challenged by diseases with variable presentations, while emergency physicians deal with interruptions and time pressure in a stressful work environment. This environment is characterized by abundant job demands (e.g. workloads) – and a lack of job resources (e.g. perceived support). Prolonged exposure to such demands and (lack of) resources increases work stress. This is especially problematic as excessive work stress hinders physicians in performing well in providing care, yet it is unknown how the diagnostic process specifically is affected. Therefore, there is a knowledge gap on whether and how stressed physicians exposed to excessive job demands and limited resources are more likely to commit more diagnostic errors.


This knowledge gap is addressed in the current PhD trajectory, by clarifying how job demands and resources, and work stress affect physicians’ diagnostic performance in emergency medicine. Your primary task as a PhD student involves conducting scientific research together with your supervisory team. This involves coordinating the data collection of studies and performing data analyses. Furthermore, you will be tasked with the writing of scientific articles, which will culminate into your PhD thesis. In addition to research tasks, you will have the opportunity to enrol in relevant courses that align with both the project requirements and your personal academic interests and you will be able to teach in our Bachelor Health Sciences and/or Master Health Care Management.


The research is a collaboration of the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management (ESHPM) and the Erasmus MC.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* A research master or master degree in psychology, health sciences, human resource studies, (interdisciplinary) social sciences or a related discipline.
* Interest in (occupational health) psychology, health care quality and the work environment of physicians.
* Strong analytical and research skills.
* Experience with quantitative research and statistical analyses, including computer skills (e.g. SPSS, Stata, SAS or R)
* Interest in qualitative research
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English and preferably also Dutch.
* You should be able to work both independently and as a member of a large multidisciplinary team (psychologists, sociologists, health scientists, physicians).


**Employment conditions and benefits**
--------------------------------------


We offer you an internationally oriented and varied job in an enthusiastic team, with excellent working conditions in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU).


The start date of this position is 1 October 2024 (or in mutual agreement) and you will be basedat at campus Woudestein at Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM). This position is for 1 fte. The salary ranges from a minimum of € 2.770 to a maximum of € 3.539 gross per month Scale PhD on a fulltime basis (38 hours), in accordance with the CAO-NU. The contract is entered into for the duration of 1.5 year, which will be extended with a second term of 2.5 years if the candidate performs well.


Everything else we offer you, you can find below!


* Everything you need for a **good work-life balance**: the option to work from home in consultation with your manager, 41 days of paid leave with a 40 hour contract, 8% holiday pay and an 8.3% end-of-year bonus, and a significant discount on a subscription for our on-campus sports centre!


* **Sustainable, inclusive and diverse work environment** with an open culture, where you can be yourself and we pay attention to each other and to the world around us. Make the most of our bicycle budget, or join networks such as Young@EUR, FAME or QuEUR.


* Time and space for your development in the broadest sense: development days and a personal career budget and free access to our university library.


* Good pension with ABP that EUR contributes 2/3rds towards, discounts on various collective insurances with Zilveren Kruis Achmea, Loyalis, and Allianz, and compensation for travel, working from home and home internet use.


* Are you currently combining your job with parenthood, or do you want to do so in the future? EUR offers partially paid parental leave and fully paid additional birth leave for partners, and our campus features a daycare (daycare not paid for by EUR).


* Moving to the Netherlands for your job with EUR? Then you may be eligible for the 30%-ruling if you meet the requirements of the Belastingdienst (Dutch tax agency), and with our Dual Career Programme we will also help your partner find the right job for them.

Je maakt de vertaalslag tussen beleid en data analyse, en vice versa. Je geeft advies over datavraagstukken en je ontwikkelt nieuwe oplossingen. Je bent een vraagbaak voor je collega's.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



Afdeling Beleidsinformatie zorgt ervoor dat de vier directies binnen het DG Digitalisering en Overheidsorganisaties (DGDDOO) de juiste informatie tot hun beschikking hebben om effectief beleid te voeren. Dat doen we door de juiste gegevens binnen de Rijksoverheid samen te brengen en te analyseren. Om dit goed te kunnen doen onderhouden we nauw contact met de verschillende departementale contactpersonen.  

We geven gevraagd en ongevraagd advies aan onze beleidscollega's op basis van verkregen inzichten. We maken terugkerende rapportages zoals de Jaarrapportage Bedrijfsvoering Rijk, maar doen ook ad hoc analyses of uitgebreider onderzoek. We zijn werkzaam op de verschillende terreinen van bedrijfsvoering zoals inkoop, duurzaamheid, ICT, personeel, facilitair en huisvesting.


De zes directies van het DG Digitalisering en Overheidsorganisaties (DGDOO) die de afdeling ondersteunt zijn: Digitale Overheid (DO), Digitale Samenleving (DS), CIO Rijk, Programma Open Overheid, Ambtenaar en Organisatie (AO), en Inkoop-, Facilitair en Huisvestingsbeleid Rijk (IFHR).



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.

HBO BACHELOR
**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


In nauwe samenwerking met de operationeel liaisons, de data-analist en je collega-ontwikkelaars werk je aan innovatieve oplossingen die onze collega’s in de operatie (opsporing, intelligence en handhaving) ondersteunen om meer rendement te halen uit operationele informatie. Door het inzichtelijk maken van grote hoeveelheden data geef je jouw collega’s handvatten om nieuwe complexe vraagstukken op te pakken of bestaande operationele vragen beter en sneller te kunnen beantwoorden. Denk aan de informatie die op telefoons van verdachten wordt gevonden, maar ook aan de banktransacties waarin criminele activiteiten gevonden kunnen worden. Je beoordeelt vragen vanuit de operatie en speelt een belangrijke rol in het bieden van advies en handelingsperspectief aan operationele teams. Je krijgt een uitdagende en afwisselende functie binnen een maatschappelijk relevante organisatie, in een collegiaal en gemotiveerd team dat samen met jou wil bouwen aan innovatieve oplossingen.  

  

Als software developer bij TROI heb je maatschappelijke impact en draag je bij aan applicaties en tools die het bijvoorbeeld mogelijk maken dat grote criminelen worden gestopt, vermiste personen worden teruggevonden of verdachten van ernstige misdrijven worden opgespoord.


**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


Als teamlid van TROI werk je onder andere samen met de TROI-teams van de andere eenheden en met het Team Business Intelligence en Kwaliteit (BI&K) in Den Haag. TROI houdt zich bezig met het inzichtelijk maken van de relevante informatie uit ‘big data’, brengt deze informatie samen en levert een bijdrage aan het komen tot tools, applicaties, analyses, inzicht en handelingsperspectief. TROI experimenteert met innovatieve methodieken en samen met jouw collega’s denk je buiten de bestaande kaders, om te komen tot realistische en passende oplossingen.  

  

TROI Den Haag bestaat uit twee volwaardige subteams die onderling samenwerken en tezamen één geheel vormen. In beide teams worden zowel ad hoc vragen uit lopende onderzoeken opgepakt (het werkproces support/zaaksondersteuning) als grotere projecten die breder inzetbaar zijn binnen bijvoorbeeld de opsporing (het werkproces development). Hoewel beide werkprocessen veel raakvlakken hebben en in elkaar kunnen overlopen, ligt jouw rol voornamelijk binnen het werkproces support.  

De ambities zijn groot en het enthousiasme om goede tools te ontwikkelen is bij elke medewerker aanwezig. Het team bestaat uit diverse specialisten, zoals UX/UI designers, front- en backend developers, testers, data scientists, analisten en specialisten op het gebied van de opsporing en ander operationeel politiewerk. Deze specialisten hebben elkaar nodig om een goed product voor de operatie neer te zetten. We zijn als team volop in ontwikkeling en hebben momentum binnen de organisatie om op inhoud en proces innovatief te werken. Kernwoorden passend bij ons team: innovatief, ‘outside the box’, ondernemend, positief kritisch en ontwikkelen. Daarnaast delen we de drive om anderen te helpen.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**About us**
------------


*Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden is the Dutch national research institute for biodiversity and systematics. With our collection of 43 million specimens, one of the world's largest natural history collections, and our state-of-the-art research facilities we develop the (inter)national research infrastructure for species, identification and monitoring. We closely collaborate with many Dutch universities, research institutes, industry, and government. We host over 150 researchers including 15 academia embedded professors and about 50 PhD students and 30 postdocs. We are an international hub for capacity building: training and educating students and experts, the new generation of modern taxonomists. We present the history of our planet, and the diversity of life on Earth, through permanent and temporary museum exhibitions, educational programmes, and online presence, with more than 500,000 visitors per year. All in all, a unique combination of science and culture in the Netherlands and elsewhere in the world!*


The effects of climate change and biodiversity loss are being felt worldwide. Despite the available biodiversity knowledge and the many organisations aiming for nature conservation, the Netherlands suffers more biodiversity loss than most European countries. To translate the increasing political need to stop further biodiversity loss and work towards solutions, governments and industry in the Netherlands (and Europe) urgently need up-to-date knowledge on all facets of biodiversity and supporting data. This requires a radical new integrated approach to monitoring technologies, new monitoring and assessment tools, and more scientific research.


Naturalis is in the middle of this development. We host one of the world's largest and most important natural history collections, a physical reference collection with unlimited potential for biodiversity research. We enhance our digital collection with digital twins, broadening our specimen based digitization concept with species-based digitization activities. We build a national research infrastructure that will enable science to identify species faster, monitor them more easily and gain better insights into interaction networks and ecosystems. The scientific results will enable the government and companies to better protect biodiversity in the Netherlands.


We are, therefore, expanding our scientific research on Dutch species in the coming years, focusing in particular on research integrating molecular techniques, imaging techniques and data science (AI) to enhance species recognition and detection. Naturalis wants to be able to identify and monitor all Dutch species. This means we face the exciting challenge to accelerate the discovery, identification, and description of species in our soil, rivers, sea and air that so far have escaped our attention. With ARISE, eDentity and Noordzeker we will have the conditional infrastructural building blocks and facilities to build the research infrastructure. Still a lot of scientific research needs to be done to integrate the building blocks into a fully operational research infrastructure and to develop it towards a radical new approach of discovering, identifying and monitoring all Dutch species in a way that can be scaled to include European or even global biodiversity.


Find out more about our research, labs and collection.


**Positions**
-------------


We are seeking two ambitious, enthusiastic, innovative scientists to strengthen our research on Dutch species, actively supporting the development of our national research infrastructures. We will challenge you to develop your leadership skills and to set up your own line of research. You will be expected to acquire project funding for new research, participate in outreach activities and mentor PhD students and postdocs.


**General requirements****and skills**

**Specificaties vacature**
--------------------------


### **Locatie(s):**


Den Haag
### **Organisatieonderdeel:**


Eenheid Den Haag
### **Vakgebied(en):**


Intelligence, Opsporing
### **Niveau:**


HBO BACHELOR
**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


In nauwe samenwerking met de operationeel liaisons, de data-analist en je collega-ontwikkelaars werk je aan innovatieve oplossingen die onze collega’s in de operatie (opsporing, intelligence en handhaving) ondersteunen om meer rendement te halen uit operationele informatie. Door het inzichtelijk maken van grote hoeveelheden data geef je jouw collega’s handvatten om nieuwe complexe vraagstukken op te pakken of bestaande operationele vragen beter en sneller te kunnen beantwoorden. Denk aan de informatie die op telefoons van verdachten wordt gevonden, maar ook aan de banktransacties waarin criminele activiteiten gevonden kunnen worden. Je beoordeelt vragen vanuit de operatie en speelt een belangrijke rol in het bieden van advies en handelingsperspectief aan operationele teams. Je krijgt een uitdagende en afwisselende functie binnen een maatschappelijk relevante organisatie, in een collegiaal en gemotiveerd team dat samen met jou wil bouwen aan innovatieve oplossingen.  

  

Als software developer bij TROI heb je maatschappelijke impact en draag je bij aan applicaties en tools die het bijvoorbeeld mogelijk maken dat grote criminelen worden gestopt, vermiste personen worden teruggevonden of verdachten van ernstige misdrijven worden opgespoord.


**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


Als teamlid van TROI werk je onder andere samen met de TROI-teams van de andere eenheden en met het Team Business Intelligence en Kwaliteit (BI&K) in Den Haag. TROI houdt zich bezig met het inzichtelijk maken van de relevante informatie uit ‘big data’, brengt deze informatie samen en levert een bijdrage aan het komen tot tools, applicaties, analyses, inzicht en handelingsperspectief. TROI experimenteert met innovatieve methodieken en samen met jouw collega’s denk je buiten de bestaande kaders, om te komen tot realistische en passende oplossingen.  

  

TROI Den Haag bestaat uit twee volwaardige subteams die onderling samenwerken en tezamen één geheel vormen. In beide teams worden zowel ad hoc vragen uit lopende onderzoeken opgepakt (het werkproces support/zaaksondersteuning) als grotere projecten die breder inzetbaar zijn binnen bijvoorbeeld de opsporing (het werkproces development). Hoewel beide werkprocessen veel raakvlakken hebben en in elkaar kunnen overlopen, ligt jouw rol voornamelijk binnen het werkproces support.  

De ambities zijn groot en het enthousiasme om goede tools te ontwikkelen is bij elke medewerker aanwezig. Het team bestaat uit diverse specialisten, zoals UX/UI designers, front- en backend developers, testers, data scientists, analisten en specialisten op het gebied van de opsporing en ander operationeel politiewerk. Deze specialisten hebben elkaar nodig om een goed product voor de operatie neer te zetten. We zijn als team volop in ontwikkeling en hebben momentum binnen de organisatie om op inhoud en proces innovatief te werken. Kernwoorden passend bij ons team: innovatief, ‘outside the box’, ondernemend, positief kritisch en ontwikkelen. Daarnaast delen we de drive om anderen te helpen.


Hoewel de standplaats Voorburg is, wordt er van je verwacht dat je daarnaast op diverse locaties werkzaam bent, waarvan het hoofdbureau in Den Haag een veel voorkomende zal zijn. Het kan voorkomen dat je voor het werk moet reizen en eventueel voor een periode op een andere locatie werkzaamheden verricht. In overleg bestaat de mogelijkheid om de werkzaamheden deels vanuit huis te verrichten.


**Wie ben jij?**
----------------


Met enthousiasme, leergierigheid en gedrevenheid zoek je altijd naar de beste en juiste oplossing. Je bent allround inzetbaar als software developer, van het bouwen van grotere tooling tot het schrijven van een script op maat. Vanuit jouw passie voor dit vak blijf je op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen op het gebied van programmeren. Als persoon ben je gewend om het initiatief te pakken en eigenaarschap te tonen, maar blijf je altijd een teamspeler. Je vindt het leuk om in een team te werken waarin ieder zijn eigen expertise heeft en waar je elkaar aanvult. Ook weet je van aanpakken en werk je graag in een Agile omgeving waarin het snel en adequaat reageren op operationele vragen centraal staat. Het opbouwen en inzetten van jouw netwerk is een eigenschap die je beheerst. Je kunt snel schakelen en effectief werken onder druk en binnen strakke deadlines. Verder ben je analytisch sterk en denk je in oplossingen, waarbij je grote brokken informatie of grote opgaven weet op te splitsen in kleine, concrete stappen. Je bent communicatief vaardig waardoor je collega's mee kan nemen in jouw wereld en je kunt ook doorvragen naar de behoeften van de opsporingsteams en informatieorganisatie.


Verder beschik je over:


* hbo (bachelor) werk- en denkniveau\*, bij voorkeur op basis van een opleiding op het vlak van informatica;
* minimaal 1 jaar ervaring met software-ontwikkeling met Python, Javascript en SQL/NoSQL databases;
* bij voorkeur ervaring met Django;
* bij voorkeur affiniteit met C-sharp en/of Angular;
* bij voorkeur ervaring en/of affiniteit met data-analyse;
* een rijbewijs B;
* goede beheersing van de Nederlandse en Engelse taal in woord en geschrift.

Het behalen van de opleiding is een vereiste om deze functie uit te kunnen oefenen. Hier vind je alle informatie met betrekking tot de selectieprocedure, het assessment en de opleiding.

Na het voltooien van de opleiding bieden we je een tijdelijke aanstelling aan, waarbij een proeftijd van één jaar van toepassing is. Na deze proeftijd volgt zo snel mogelijk een vaste aanstelling.


Verder kun je het volgende van ons verwachten:

Een deel van je tijd houd je je bezig met het (door)ontwikkelen van onze chatbot Ziv. Je ontwikkelt de dialogen, waarbij je verantwoordelijk bent voor het correct herkennen van klantvragen uit de data en het stellen van de juiste vragen (vanuit de chatbot) om op maat gemaakte antwoorden te bieden. Dit vereist het gebruik van verschillende technieken, variërend van IBM Watson Assistant tot LLM’s zoals ChatGPT. Hiervoor is een uitstekende programmeervaardigheid, NLP/NLU kennis en het kunnen vertalen van klantbehoeftes naar oplossingen vereist. Verder vind je het leuk om je te verdiepen in de nieuwste technieken rondom chatbots, zoals de OpenAI services, die beschikbaar zijn binnen Achmea.

 **Hoe ziet je dag eruit?**


Je bent bezig met het implementeren van een nieuw dialoog voor Ziv die gevoed wordt vanuit ons 360 graden klantbeeld. Naast de technische uitdaging om dit voor elkaar te krijgen, wil je je collega’s in je multidisciplinaire team overtuigen dat jouw dialoog opzet gaat helpen om de klantbehoeftes in te vullen. Hiervoor geef je in de middag een presentatie waarin je ze meeneemt in de dialoog opzet en hoe deze in de praktijk werkt. Na deze geslaagde meeting bespreek je de verdere ontwikkeling van de code guidelines met je collega data scientists om zoveel uniform te werken binnen jullie data science processen.

***Explainable AI for Crowd Dynamics: Predict and Assess Risk with Data. Join us to develop AI models for better decision-making in crowd crisis management.***

  


Job description


A major challenge in crises is the combination of complexity, time pressure and moral decisions. AI has the potential to support crowd crises decisions, yet the increasing use of AI has led to a debate about the legal and ethical implications.



In this PhD project, our primary focus is to harness the capabilities of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to better understand and manage crowd dynamics by integrating diverse data sets that include contextual information such as weather conditions, social media sentiment, and specific event characteristics. The objective is to develop predictive models that not only forecast crowd behaviors under various scenarios but also explain the underlying reasons for such predictions to facilitate transparent decision-making. This involves creating advanced AI algorithms capable of handling real-time data, ensuring data accuracy, and overcoming the challenges posed by the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of crowd movements. By improving the interpretability of AI outputs, stakeholders—from event organizers to city planners and emergency response teams—can make more informed decisions, enhancing safety and efficiency during large-scale public events.



The research will proceed through several progressive phases, each building upon the insights and technologies developed in the preceding one. Initially, we will focus on the development and validation of predictive and forecasting models for crowd management, utilizing regression trees, ensemble models, and techniques like XGBoost for feature selection and interpretability. Subsequent phases will involve the integration and categorization of risks using XAI to assess and predict potential incident scenarios and their impacts. This multi-disciplinary approach will extend into crowdsourcing and gamification strategies to collect diverse data, which will be used to continuously train and refine our models. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust, scalable system that not only predicts and categorizes risks but also provides actionable, data-driven advice on crowd management interventions. These interventions will be optimized through continuous learning frameworks and evolutionary algorithms, ensuring that the system evolves in response to new data and changing environments.



The position is a part of the AI-COMPASS team of three PhD researchers that will collectively research crowd crisis management at the TU Delft. This position is embedded at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) and will be jointly supervised with the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management (TPM). As such, the candidate will be joining a vibrant and growing community. You will be supervised by Prof. Serge Hoogendoorn and Prof. Tina Comes, and you will closely collaborate with Dr. Sascha Hoogendoorn-Lanser. This embedding ensures access to a broad network of partners in research, policy and practice. You may also gain experience in supervising MSc students and engage in teaching and training. Via our network and tailored mentoring, we will create opportunities for you to develop your career through support for conferences, collaborations and training possibilities.


Requirements


You are a highly motivated and enthusiastic researcher with the ambition to conduct high-quality interdisciplinary research that pushes the boundaries of human-centred AI research in crises. Specifically:


* You have a Master’s degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, or a related field.
* You have strong programming skills and experience with machine learning tools and techniques.
* You have excellent analytical and problem-solving abilities
* You have excellent study results and excellent command of English. Dutch language skills are a plus.

You will work on the project “Ice-ocean interactions in West Antarctica during rapid transitions in past warm climates”. In this position, you map out in detail the geographic distribution of dinoflagellate cyst species and organic geochemical biomarkers around West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula.


**Your job**
------------


You are expected to generate organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst assemblage data from surface sediment samples available at the British Antarctic Survey. In addition, the project involves the generation of organic geochemical biomarker data from the same surface sediment samples, both with the aim of improving their accuracy as proxy for surface oceanographic conditions. Alongside this, there are opportunities to generate sedimentological and inorganic geochemical data as well, which are indicative of both ocean and ice dynamics. Towards the end of the project, you will contribute to the application of the improved proxies to reconstruct surface ocean change during prominent deglaciation phases in West-Antarctica.


The position is part of a larger interdisciplinary project, that includes a PhD candidate that focuses on the paleoceanographic reconstructions during the Pleistocene and Pliocene, with whom you will closely collaborate. Both positions are funded by the Dutch National Science Foundation NWO in a special call of the Polar Programme in collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey. The positions are based in the Marine Palynology & Paleoceanography group at the Department of Earth Sciences in Utrecht, NL. Regular visits to the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK, are foreseen.

This project really seeks a problem-solver, someone who isn’t let down by the first disappointment. You demonstrate the capability to contribute yourself to the planning and organisation of your work as well as that of the PhD, with a keen interest in taking initiatives for the direction in which the projects develop.


You must have successfully completed a PhD programme in Earth Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Biology, micropaleontology, palynology or a related discipline by the time the position starts. You have:


* experience in palynology/micropaleontology, including microscope work (required);
* experience in working in a laboratory (required);
* evident passion for teamwork, and willingness to travel (also abroad);
* adequate social/verbal/communication skills.


Preferably, you also have:


* a strong interest in paleoclimate/paleoceanography;
* experience in proxy development;
* experience in (in)organic geochemistry.

**About us**
------------


A better future for everyone. This ambition motivates our scientists in executing their leading research and inspiring teaching. At Utrecht University, the various disciplines collaborate intensively towards major strategic themes. Our focus is on Dynamics of Youth, Institutions for Open Societies, Life Sciences and Pathways to Sustainability. Sharing science, shaping tomorrow.


Utrecht University’s Faculty of Geosciences studies the Earth: from the Earth’s core to its surface, including man’s spatial and material utilisation of the Earth – always with a focus on sustainability and innovation. With 3,400 students (BSc and MSc) and 720 staff, the faculty is a strong and challenging organisation. The Faculty of Geosciences is organised in four Departments: Earth Sciences, Human Geography & Spatial Planning, Physical Geography, and Sustainable Development.


The department of Earth Sciences conducts teaching and research across the full range of the solid Earth and environmental Earth sciences, with activities in almost all areas of geology, geochemistry, geophysics, biogeology and hydrogeology. The department hosts a highly international tenured staff of over 50 scientists and more than 110 PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers. Our research programme spans four intertwined themes: Climate & Life, Earth interior, Earth materials, and Environmental Earth Sciences. We house or have access to a wide variety of world-class laboratories.


The Marine Palynology & Paleoceanography group focuses with four permanent staff members on paleoceanographic and paleoenvironmental reconstructions in the entire Phanerozoic, specifically by looking at organic microfossils, usually in close collaboration with additional disciplines in the department and abroad. There is a close link between this project and the paleoclimate research within the virtual Netherlands Earth System Science Centre (NESSC), which focuses on tipping points within the climate system, and its successor, the Earth System Feedback Research Centre, which will run at least until 2035. This brings together a large cohort of PhD candidates in a national highly interdisciplinary and strongly collaborative (paleo-)climate community.


The department and its facilities are located at Utrecht Science Park. Utrecht is the fourth largest city in the Netherlands with a population of nearly 360,000 and forms a hub in the middle of the country. Its historical city centre and its modern central station can easily be reached from the Science Park by public transport or by a 15-minute bicycle ride. Utrecht boasts beautiful canals with extraordinary wharf cellars housing cafés and terraces by the water, as well as a broad variety of shops and boutiques.

There is a close link between this project and the paleoclimate research within the virtual Netherlands Earth System Science Centre (NESSC), which focuses on tipping points within the climate system, and its successor, the Earth System Feedback Research Centre, which will run at least until 2035. This brings together a large cohort of PhD candidates in a national highly interdisciplinary and strongly collaborative (paleo-)climate community.


The department and its facilities are located at Utrecht Science Park. Utrecht is the fourth largest city in the Netherlands with a population of nearly 360,000 and forms a hub in the middle of the country. Its historical city centre and its modern central station can easily be reached from the Science Park by public transport or by a 15-minute bicycle ride. Utrecht boasts beautiful canals with extraordinary wharf cellars housing cafés and terraces by the water, as well as a broad variety of shops and boutiques.

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.  

  

Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?  

  

Naast een afgeronde Bachelor of Master en enkele jaren werkervaring zijn dit de specifieke skills die we zoeken:

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

As a data platform engineer, you will be working on our data platform named Thor. With Thor, we want to create a self-service, metadata driven data platform where data producers can share their data with the data consumers without the platform team being the bottleneck. This means that we are working hard to enable our users so they can do as much as possible themselves and we can focus on improving and optimizing our pipelines and codebase.

 **A few cool new features we have recently implemented:**

* Smart Scheduling that dynamically changes data pipeline configuration based on historical statistics
* A versioned data platform that allows the product to scale to other brands
* Documentation that writes itself


If you want to know more about how it is to work in this team, read: https://werk.ah.nl/colleagues/charlotte-van-der-scheun/

* You optimize performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency of data pipelines and analytics workloads on Databricks
* You enable data producers with self-service capabilities on our data platform granting them the freedom to autonomously share their data to the rest of the organization for data driven insights
* You stay informed latest developments on technologies and industry trends, and evaluate their potential impact on our data platform strategy

 **Your new team and office.**

We want to leverage data and technology to future-proof food shopping and give our customers the accessibility to healthy food more easily available for everyone.

Our teams work in a hybrid way: both from home as well as in the office. We are located right next to the train station of Zaandam.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**Faculteit/Dienst:** Faculteit der Natuurw., Wiskunde & Informatica
**Opleidingsniveau:** Master
**Functie type:** Promotieplaats
**Sluitingsdatum:** 18.08.2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13165
We have two positions available for a PhD Student in Cellular imaging and in Neuroscience. The two positions are funded by a grant from NWO “Visualizing and manipulating synaptic AMPA-receptor plasticity with a new molecular toolkit”. The two PhD students are expected to closely collaborate within this project.  


The two positions are embedded respectively in the following two UvA/SILS research groups:  


Molecular Cytology studies the dynamic architecture of living cells. By employing genetic encoded fluorescent biosensors we analyze the molecular interactions between signaling molecules and flow of information across and in the plane of the membrane of living mammalian cells. We aim to understand how cells respond to internal and external cues using advanced microscopy tools.  


**Project 1**: Engineering of novel tools for visualization and manipulation of signaling molecules that drive synaptic plasticity.  


This project builds on our efforts to engineer biosensors ad optogenetic tools that can be used in relevant complex biological systems to interrogate signaling networks. In this project protein engineering and microscopy-based screening will be applied to generate new biosensors that have lifetime contrast, as these have advantageous properties for quantitative imaging in complex systems. In addition, we aim to generate genetically encoded components that can manipulate cAMP levels or other signaling components that potentially control synaptic AMPA-receptor plasticity.  


Cellular and Computational Neuroscience is part of the SILS Neuroscience theme and investigates the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity mechanism that underlie learning and memory, at the level of cellular and network neuroscience using electrophysiological, live-imaging, pharmacological and molecular techniques.  


**Project 2**: Understanding the synaptic plasticity mechanisms that underlie memory retrieval  


In this project the synaptic plasticity processes will be examined that underlie memory retrieval in the hippocampus. We hypothesize that noradrenaline signalling selectively increases the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP at actively communicating synapses, thereby increasing conductance of AMPA-receptors at these synapses. To study these molecular processes, whole-cell electrophysiology will be combined with live-imaging and optogenetics. This project is directly relevant to increase our understanding of how memories can be reactivated and why memory retrieval is impaired in early Alzheimer’s disease.

The trajectories are constructive and lead to high quality, cost-effective systems with predictable properties (functionality, timing, reliability, power dissipation, and cost).


Philips Image Guided Therapy is a business category within Royal Philips. The Image Guided Therapy department focuses on developing innovative medical devices and solutions that enable minimally invasive and image-guided procedures in the field of healthcare. These technologies are designed to help healthcare professionals perform procedures such as interventional cardiology, radiology, and surgery with greater precision and efficiency. Philips Image Guided Therapy solutions often incorporate advanced imaging, data analytics, and visualization technologies to enhance patient care and improve clinical outcomes. https://www.philips.com/healthcare/e/image-guided-therapy.

The Faculty of Science and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) are looking for:

**PhD candidate | Environmental impact assessment of pollution at the ecosystem level (0.8-1.0 fte)**

**Vacancy number: (14994)**


**Background**


The freshwater system and its adjacent ecosystems host countless species because of their need of water. These are the earths’ natural capital and drivers of many ecosystem services we humans depend on. At the same time, the presence and effects of anthropogenic stress in the aquatic environment are multitude and ubiquitous. These include the omnipresence of chemical pollution such as the use of agricultural chemicals.


To relatively quickly assess the impacts of chemicals a standard risk assessment framework is in place. While valuable, the frameworks often lacks ecological realism. Researchers from Leiden University therefore experiment in outdoor freshwater experimental systems with natural food webs such as the “Levend Lab” (EN: “Living Lab”, https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/livinglab) to identify how biodiversity responds to the impacts of pesticides, fertilizers, invasive species and nanomaterials.


Using ecological theory, a large array of different experimental and statistical analytical methods are currently in practice to perform and analyze such experiments. The key challenge for the PhD candidate is to test these different forms of experimental and statistical analytical methods to identify stressor - ecosystem function relationships. The research will likely entail measuring different forms of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functionality followed by statistical modelling to infer causality of stressor impacts and their propagation through the ecosystem.


We invite prospective candidates to unravel the intricate network of species interactions between each other and their environment. The candidate will use new analytical methods and develops models and interpretation scenarios to identify how pollution impacts species and their role in ecosystem functionality.

**Key tasks:**

* *Perform* mesocosm pollution experiments in the ‘Levend Lab’ facility of Leiden University
* *Further develop* and test different types of statistical analyses at the community to ecosystem level
* *Advance* ecological theory by identifying the anthropological and natural drivers of species and their roles in ecosystems

**Selection criteria:**

* You should have an M.Sc. in a relevant field (environmental science, biology, ecology and/or ecotoxicology), but we also consider candidates from other related scientific fields.
* Experience with experimental field and laboratory skills and (aquatic) organism identifications are highly valued
* Strong background and interest in statistical analyses, data management, visualization and coding skills (in R, but Python also applies) is highly valued.
* You must be proficient in spoken and written English.
* You are a team player and have a collaborative attitude.


**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,800 staff and almost 6,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 150 FTE (including postdocs and PhD candidates) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

We offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 4 years based on performance. Salary ranges from € 2.770 gross per month in the first year to € 3.539 gross per month in the fourth year based on a full-time position (pay scale P in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities).


Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development and sabbatical leave. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break.


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website. Female researchers are also welcomed to join the Researchers In Science for Equality network of the Faculty if Science (rise.nu).

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work.

* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;

* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;

Van werkstress tot machineveiligheid en van hybride werken tot gevaarlijke stoffen. Arbo is het platform dat arboprofessionals ondersteunt in hun dagelijks werk. Door ze te informeren over ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken. Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.  

  

**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.



Als hoofdredacteur Arbo ben je onderdeel van de centrale redactie van het ‘professionals portfolio’ van VMN media, waar ook PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb onderdeel van zijn. Samen zijn we een team van 14 personen.

 **Wat krijg je:**

* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.



Verder nog handig om te weten: het gaat om een functie van 36 uur per week. Het kantoor van VMN media staat in Zeist.
