Then this is the perfect job for you!
  
Knab was founded in 2012. We are an online bank, but one run by real people. We are known for being different because we want to do things differently. Simpler, smarter, and more affordable for our customers. By combining smart technology with a healthy dose of common sense, we create financial services that meet your needs. We add sublime, personal service to this, creating something unique in the financial sector.  

  

**Your role and responsibilities**  

Are you passionate about problem solving and combining the use of different tools in your daily work? And are you interested in the interest rate risk and enjoy improving processes? As a Senior ALM Specialist you will be responsible for managing and modelling interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) in a small and engaged team.  

  

Furthermore, the role will include at least the following:


* Managing the interest rate risk through hedging and designing optimal risk steering;
* Developing and refining interest rate related models (e.g. non-maturing deposits, cash flows, prepayments, mortgage pipeline, hedge accounting);
* Shaping decision-making, policies and analyses for senior management;
* Reporting the IRRBB and FX position to ALCO;
* Staying up-to-date with the latest changes in regulation (i.e. EBA, BCBS 239) related to IRRBB management;
* Enhancing reporting processes with regard to the automation and quality of the reported data;
* Assisting junior team members in their professional development.


The current interest rate environment and changes in EBA IRRBB regulation make it a very dynamic and exciting time to be part of a first-line of defence ALM team. The combination of the current economic climate, a flat-structured bank and a wide range of projects offer you a great opportunity to grow professionally and develop a holistic view on interest rate risk of the bank.  

  

**The team**  

The Asset and Liability Management & Methodology (ALM&M) team’s goal is to deliver on Knab’s strategy by optimizing the balance sheet of Knab. We do this by ensuring that the interest rate risk and funding positions of Knab are managed within the boundaries set in the strategies for those risks whilst not losing sight of the profitability of the bank.  

  

We believe in assigning ownership instead of tasks and, as a result, everyone within the ALM&M team gets the chance to own and be in the lead of a focus area within our team. This creates a flat structure which enables people to take initiative and develop their professional career on their own terms.  

  

On a personal side, we are a fun and multi-national team of curious and knowledgeable people. We perceive work as a challenge to improve ourselves and the bank. We like to work together and learn from each other through regular knowledge sharing sessions. We also enjoy spending time together outside of the work (e.g. having a drink or a game of padel.  

  

**Your profile**  

To be successful in this role, this is the kind of traits we have in mind:


* Completed masters degree in (Quantitative) Finance, Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics or similar;
* 5-7 years of relevant working experience in financial modelling, ALM or balance sheet management;
* Experience with Python, R, VBA (Excel) or C++ is a must, SQL is a plus;
* Experience with ALM / risk software solutions such as QRM or Ambit Focus is preferred;
* Ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and concise way;
* Self-starter with the ability, agility and motivation for self-learning;
* Excellent control of the English language, both written and verbally. Dutch is a bonus.


Did you know that according to research, women are less likely to apply than men when they don't meet all the job requirements? What a shame. Because, in our view, 'the perfect candidate' is a myth. So, if you have the drive to grow in aspects of this role, we look forward to your application.  

  

**This is Knab and this is what we offer you**  

Come as you are. Knab is an open workplace with positive vibes. We are inclusive of all nationalities, races and genders. We feel comfortable to bring our authentic whole selves to work and like you to do so too.  

  

If you come to work with us, Knab will become a significant part of your life. Therefore, we make sure the ambiance is just as exciting as your job. If you have any questions regarding this role or the process, please feel free to reach out to us.

=====================

* **We are on a mission** to make programming biology easy. We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.
* We're an **experienced team**. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!
* We're focused on building the **best possible team culture**. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.
* We offer **top of the market** salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.


**Responsibilities**:


As a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:

* Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools
* Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations
* Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process
* Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain
* Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.
* Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem

**Need to haves**
=================

* Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills
* You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.
* You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer\*, or even implement a UI plugin.
* You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.
* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**
=================

* Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.
* A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.
* You have worked with databases or big data systems.
* You have designed user interfaces and are familiar with one or more of the popular frameworks.
* You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.
* Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Cradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.**  

  

We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.


You will be joining a high-growth, highly ambitious startup with an experienced founding team, whose motivation is building a more sustainable world using biology. We are backed by some of the most well known investors and industry veterans.

The sub-team focusing on ESG Data has been active for almost a year. As a member of this team, the goal is to collaboratively build an ESG Data platform with IT Developers to supply the team involved in Sustainable Finance Regulation Modelling with the necessary data to monitor ESG risk.  

  

Given the significance that regulatory authorities attribute to modelling and the underlying data, this role is challenging and impactful. The Sustainable Finance Regulation project is a new and excellent opportunity to become familiar with this development. Tasks related to this project, which involve building the platform, include:  

  

* Inventory of the playing field with all stakeholders and parties involved;
* Collection of all data requirements for the models;
* Gap analysis of the data requirements for the SFR regulation and the data already available on the platform;
* Planning of the delivery of the required data;
* Actual delivery of dataset to the consumers.


  

Once the platform is ready, you will be involved in the data collection process. Your duties will encompass technical aspects such as SQL and Python programming, performing Data Quality analyses, and integrating datasets. Simultaneously, you'll be working on documentation and utilizing your communicative skills for stakeholder alignment. Active participation in frequent team meetings, where knowledge-sharing and progress transparency are key, is also expected. In this role, everything revolves around data modelling, along with related activities:  

  

* Discussing data requirements for different ESG risk models and reports with the modellers and reporting analysts;
* Make an inventory of the relevant databases within the bank and gain access to them;
* Combine tables (merge / link) and aggregate data in SQL and Python;
* Apply Data Quality Analysis, for example, course over time, missing values, extreme values;
* Investigate the plausibility of the new data;
* Document the data sourcing process and descriptive statistics and discuss this with the business parties;
* Additionally, there are many ad hoc activities, and you will regularly participate in cross-departmental projects. Your ability and willingness to collaborate are crucial for success in this role. You naturally take initiative, organize work effectively, and eagerly work with others to deliver tangible results. You possess a practical, analytical approach and strong communication and presentation skills. Being a robust team player, you take responsibility for your work. In the dynamic environment in which you operate, you have the ability to get all stakeholders on board.

-------------------

 **Do you want to commit to a critical challenge and help to shape our future?**


We keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages, and configuration errors.


We are looking for a team member who is driven by technical challenges and the urge to always find better and more efficient ways of delivering services to the customer.  

  

**What will you do?**


In the role as SRE engineer you will combine the skillset of dev teams and operations teams by applying a software engineering approach to IT operations.


To succeed in this role it is important that you are self-driven, exact, analytic, critical and know how to prioritize. You are not only an expert in your field but you also have social competence and understand the business needs. You always challenge yourself and others to improve. You are also open for suggestions from others and can also give your own.


You are a team player and have a hands-on mindset, a strong customer- and problem-solving orientation. You show fast results, and you have demonstrated good communication skills, especially in an international organization. You need to be able to work independently in an international team that meets more virtually than physically.

  

  

**Your tasks and responsibilities:**

**Maintaining Applications to Help Operations and Support Teams**


As a SRE you are in charge of proactively implementing and maintaining infrastructure and business applications. This can be anything from provisioning servers, updating systems, deploying new software, providing pre-emptive maintenance to monitoring and alerting to code changes in production. A site reliability engineer can be tasked with building a homegrown tool from scratch to help with weaknesses in software delivery or incident management.


You must always be looking to improve quality and efficiency and cut costs.

**Fixing Support Escalation Issues**


Similarly to the point above, a site reliability engineer can be expected to spend time fixing support escalation cases.

**Optimizing On-Call Rotations and Processes**


More times than not, site reliability engineers will need to take on-call responsibilities and improve system reliability through the optimization of on-call processes. You will help add automation and context to alerts – leading to better real-time collaborative response from on-call responders. Additionally, you will update runbooks, tools and documentation to help prepare your on-call team members for future incidents.

**Documenting “Tribal” K****nowledge**


As you gain exposure to systems in both staging and production, as well as all technical teams, you will take part in work with software development, support, IT operations and on-call duties – meaning you will build up a great amount of historical knowledge over time. Instead of keeping this knowledge in the mind of one team or one person, as SRE you are expected to document much of what you know. Constant upkeep of documentation and runbooks can ensure teams get the information they need right when they need it.

**Conducting Post-Incident Reviews**


Without thorough post-incident reviews, you have no way to identify what’s working and what’s not. As such you will be participating in post-incident reviews, documenting your findings and taking action on your learnings.


Maybe also add \""provision new servers\""... it is attractive to have a more technical approach to woo away developers and coordinators!

 **Location**  

  

Katowice, Gliwice, Amsterdam or Solna

**Jouw profiel**
----------------

 **Who are you?**  

  

As our Site Reliability Engineer you:

* Are an expert in your field, strong technical and analytical skills, can solve impossible problems.
* Have the ability to translate complicated technical matters into simple understandable language.

* Have thorough knowledge of operating systems (Linux/Windows 2019 and up).
* Work with Agile methodology.
* Have experience in troubleshooting and root cause analysis.

Next to this you bring:

* Experience in a large international environment is desirable.

 ***We’re on this journey together:*** Working at a successful startup isn’t the same every day, as we constantly grow and innovate, we face new challenges. It’s important that we embrace this journey but also positively support each other. In practice, this can range from pair programming to travelling and celebrating together.

 ***We do it right:*** When you’re moving fast it can be tempting to constantly cut corners to things done. But this results in a product that is a struggle to work with and has unhappy users. We make that extra effort to be proud of what we’re building; understand the problem we’re solving, write one more test or tackle technical debt.

 ***We are empowered to act, challenge and lead:*** To work effectively as a team everyone must have a voice and feel they can stand up and be counted. As a software engineer at Returnista we want you to feel empowered. That could mean proposing new ideas, fixing things without seeking permission or challenging the CEO.

 ***We are intrepid:*** We want our engineers to show initiative and to innovate. Intrepid Friday’s give us the opportunity to work on things that might not ostensibly be the highest priority, but can make a big difference to our product or how we work.

### **What we offer**

* Contribute towards the drafting of key findings, research reports and articles.
* Suggest ways to improve methodologies, scoring guidelines, research workflows, and analytical techniques.

* At least three years of professional research experience in relevant fields.

* Strong verbal and written English communication skills; able to write clearly and concisely for professional audiences. Additional language skills are a plus.
* Solid grasp of applied statistics and data analysis as well as familiarity with database querying and spreadsheets. Ability to script in R or Python is a plus.

* Strong interest in research, especially on corporate performance on sustainable development and the business and policy environments that shape that performance.

* Potential to thrive in a teal culture based on self-managed teams, able to take initiative, self-reflect and collaborate with colleagues.
* Comfortable in a globally inclusive, multi-cultural, fast-paced, agile, and virtual/hybrid environment that promotes flexibility whilst being able to meet deadlines.

**What are you going to do**  

The Postdoc will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.  

The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and one Postdoc, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).

* Supervise RA’s and PhD’s working on the project;
* Draft pre-registrations and submit ethics reviews.
* Conduct data-analysis and prepare results for publications;
* Draft articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals;

Contribute to the Connected Minds Lab and the wider scientific community through collaborations, workshops, presentations/talks, attending conferences.

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=8b635dac2bd0c1f2,indeed,Data Analyst,Orbisk,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Orbisk,"Utrecht, UT, NL","parttime, fulltime",2024-07-31,,,,,True,,,,"**Our employees talk trash all day, every day.**

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**Assistance and Advisory Service (AAS)**



The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) is NATO's principal C3 capability deliverer and CIS service provider. It provides, maintains and defends the NATO enterprise-wide information technology infrastructure to enable Allies to consult together under Article IV, and, when required, stand together in the face of attack under Article V.



To provide these critical services, in the modern evolving dynamic environment the NCI Agency needs to build and maintain high performance-engaged workforce. The NCI Agency workforce strategically consists of three major categorise's: NATO International Civilians (NIC)'s, Military (Mil), and Interim Workforce Consultants (IWC)'s. The IWCs are a critical part of the overall NCI Agency workforce and make up approximately 15 percent of the total workforce.



**Role Background**

----------------


Are you a bachelor student within a technical study, such as Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, and are you looking for an apprentice internship? Do you enjoy programming? Are you skilled in MATLAB or Python? Would you like to apply your theoretical knowledge in a real world setting and gain some practical experience? Then this internship might be interesting to you!

**Background information**
--------------------------


The Metrology Leveling department is part of the Development and Engineering sector of ASML. Our primary focus is on measuring each silicon wafer prior to exposure inside the Twinscan, generating a surface map with nanometer precision. In addition, we also play a role in the calibration of the Twinscan itself and maintain the control of the ""measure sequence"", which includes both our measurements and those from other departments, such as Horizontal Alignment. Stage alignment (SA) is the functionality that is used to determine the position (and shape) of plates of the wafer stage with respect to the metro frame. These plates are used as a reference for other measurements - both on measure and on expose side. Which plate or plates are measured, on which plate reticle alignment is done and the type of measure sequence (Production, Robust, etc.) differs per platform.

**Your assignment**
-------------------


With the introduction of a new Stage Alignment sequence in software, we also need to update the diagnostics tool used to analyze and visualize data from the machine. One of the biggest diagnostics tools, FlatNG, needs to be updated to handle the analysis and visualization of data from this new sequence. This will allow customers to help troubleshoot their systems themselves or with the help of the local office. Therefore, this assignment consists of adding this new functionality to the diagnostics tool. Additionally, some other tasks may include fixing bugs in the tool or even attempting to link the measure sequence and stage alignment sequence tooling dashboards.

**Your profile**
----------------


To be a match for this internship, you:

* Are busy with your bachelor's in Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, or in a related technical study;
* Are skilled in MATLAB and/or Python;

De Algemene Rekenkamer doet onderzoek naar uiteenlopende maatschappelijke onderwerpen. Bijvoorbeeld gelijke kansen in het mbo, de werking van het Nederlandse witwasbeleid of de energietransitie. Kom jij ons team van data-specialisten versterken met kwantitatief onderzoek naar deze of andere onderwerpen? Lees dan verder.


**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Op basis van je ruime ervaring met kwantitatief beleidsonderzoek lever je een bijdrage aan het onderzoek naar het functioneren en presteren van de rijksoverheid. Bijvoorbeeld door kansen voor doelmatigheidsonderzoeken waarin data-analyse een grote rol speelt te herkennen en deze te vertalen in onderzoeksvoorstellen. Je werkt hierin samen met collega’s met minder statistische kennis (medeonderzoekers, maar ook onze bestuurders). Je voert gesprekken met mensen die werken bij overheidsorganisaties om te inventariseren welke mogelijkheden en beperkingen er zijn voor data-analyse in het onderzoek en gebruikt deze inzichten voor het opstellen van een haalbaar plan van aanpak. Vervolgens zorg je ook tijdens de uitvoering van het onderzoek voor de succesvolle uitvoering van de geplande analyses en stuurt wanneer dat nodig is bij. Tot slot weet je de complexe uitkomsten te vertalen naar duidelijke aanbevelingen voor bijvoorbeeld de onderzochte partijen, Tweede Kamerleden en/of verantwoordelijk bewindspersonen.


**Over de Algemene Rekenkamer**
-------------------------------


Wij onderzoeken of de rijksoverheid zinnig, zuinig en zorgvuldig omgaat met publiek geld. Het is onze wettelijke taak de inkomsten en uitgaven van het Rijk te controleren. Op Verantwoordingsdag, de derde woensdag in mei, rapporteren we aan het parlement wat onze bevindingen zijn. Op basis van ons oordeel kan het parlement besluiten of het decharge verleent aan het kabinet. Daarnaast brengen we rapporten uit over onderzoeken naar beleid van ministers. Zo helpen we Kamerleden te bepalen of dat beleid werkt.

**Het team**
------------


Binnen de Algemene Rekenkamer houdt de Data Hub (ca 10 fte en onderdeel van de directie Audit & Data) zich bezig met het bevorderen van data-analyse binnen de organisatie en in onderzoek.


Het team bestaat uit kwantitatief onderzoekers en business informatie analisten met verschillende disciplinaire achtergronden. Voor dit team zoeken we een kwantitatief onderzoeker beleidsonderzoek met ervaring in het toepassen van kwantitatieve methoden en technieken van onderzoek om inzicht te krijgen in de effectiviteit en efficiëntie van beleid. Samen zorgen we voor:


* De ondersteuning van onderzoeksteams met de voorbereiding en uitvoering van onderzoeksprojecten waarin kwantitatieve methoden een belangrijk onderdeel vormen. We geven sturing aan (deel)projecten. En maken daarbij gebruik van wetenschappelijk verantwoorde werkwijzen.
* Methodologisch advies in de ontwerpfase van nieuwe onderzoeksprojecten. We zijn proactief en brengen onze methodische kennis ook goed over aan collega’s die over minder kwantitatieve kennis beschikken.
* Het vergroten van datavaardigheden van collega’s binnen de Algemene Rekenkamer. Denk aan het helpen van een collega met code review of het geven van cursussen en ontwikkelen van ondersteunende materialen. Maar ook aan het organiseren van kennisuitwisseling, zoals deep dives binnen de organisatie en met nationale en internationale partners.

### **Profiel**


Als business controller ben je samenwerkend, initiatiefrijk, analytisch sterk en beschik je over overtuigingskracht. Je bent een snelle denker die durft om zich kritisch op te stellen. Daarnaast ben je ondersteunend en verbindend, met een sterk vermogen om advies te geven. Je kunt zowel zelfstandig als in teamverband werken. Je hebt een stevige persoonlijkheid en uitstekende mondelinge en schriftelijke communicatieve vaardigheden.  

  

Specifieke functie eisen:


* Je hebt affiniteit en ervaring met data-analyses en weet registratieve (o.a. boekhoud) systemen conceptueel snel met elkaar te verbinden en data uit deze te vertalen naar bruikbare inzichten op strategisch en tactisch niveau.
* Je beschikt over excellente Excel vaardigheden. Modellen opstellen met behulp van PowerBI of PowerQuery, PowerPivot en af en toe wat VBA, is jouw ding.
* Ervaring met/ kennis van SQL of R, is een pluspunt.
* Ervaring binnen een onderwijs- of onderzoekinstelling is een pluspunt.

  

 

Bekijk hier de voorwaarden voor indiensttreding bij Erasmus MC.


  
### **Wat bieden wij**

  

* Een jaarcontract met uitzicht op een vast dienstverband.
* Een bruto maandsalaris tussen de € 4.678,- en € 6.402,- (schaal 11) bij een volledige werkweek van 36 uur.
* Doorgroeimogelijkheden en opleidingen.
* Gedeeltelijk thuiswerken behoort tot de mogelijkheden, net als 4 x 9 uur werken.
* Een 13e maand die we in november uitkeren en een reiskostenvergoeding.

To scale up prevention of leprosy supported by PEP services research, innovation and building up an evidence based track record are required.

Je gaat ons helpen om het speelveld van vastgoed volledig op zijn kop te zetten. We denken dat de data revolutie dat mogelijk maakt en willen daar een serieuze bijdrage aan leveren. De beschikbaarheid van data zal meer fundament leggen onder elke vastgoedbeslissing. Het kan nu evidence-based (en tsja, als het kan dan moet het ook).

Je gaat onze opdrachtgevers helpen met het nemen van goed onderbouwde beslissingen. Je gaat data opsporen, ontsluiten en presenteren. Door slimme algoritmen zorg je er voor dat onze opdrachtgevers tot betere inzichten komen. Kortom: je gaat je data-skills inzetten om echte problemen op te lossen. Begrip van de context is daarvoor noodzakelijk. Vaak werk je dan ook samen met onze vastgoedspecialisten, samen komen jullie tot de beste oplossing.

Je pioniert samen met een team aan onze innovaties. Het zou mooi zijn als je ervaring hebt met ETL en R, maar daar kunnen we je ook bij helpen. Je werkt meestal aan drie of vier projecten tegelijkertijd. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan de ontwikkeling van tooling voor assetmanagement, de waardering van woningportefeuilles op basis van open data of een benchmark van het voorzieningenniveau van gemeenten. Sommige projecten zijn kort en intensief, andere projecten vereisen een langere aanloop. Het mooie van consultancy is dat je alleen wordt ingehuurd voor de spannende projecten. De projecten die er toe doen.

Je komt in aanraking met allerlei soorten opdrachtgevers en allerlei type vraagstukken in een steeds veranderende context. Die afwisseling en uitdaging maakt dat je snel leert. Daarnaast kun je er van op aan dat onze ervaren data specialisten je helpen in jouw ontwikkeling.

Geen eindeloze overleggen, trage besluitvorming en overlopende email-box maar alle tijd en ruimte om echt met mijn vak bezig te zijn. Elke dag weer. Mijn vastberadenheid om ook echt impact te maken sluit naadloos aan bij de rest van het team. Samen zetten we de schouders er onder en zorgen we dat het lukt.”*

Leoniek Driessens

*“Ervaring of functie zijn van ondergeschikt belang, het draait om de inhoud. Dat merkte ik al in de eerste maand van mijn afstudeerperiode: ik ging meteen mee op een driedaagse ‘field-trip’ bij een corporatie in Groningen. En daar werd ook nog verwacht dat ik een serieuze bijdrage zou leveren aan het project. Mijn collega’s dagen me elke dag uit om een nog betere adviseur te worden. Soms door me te helpen maar soms ook door me bewust even te laten verzuipen en me te leren om zelf tot oplossingen te komen.”*

Als data analist ben je verantwoordelijk voor het uitvoeren van statistische analyses op allerlei databronnen die we binnen en buiten VeiligheidNL tot onze beschikking hebben. Dat kan ons eigen Letsel Informatie Systeem zijn of bijvoorbeeld ambulancedata en politiedata. Je gebruikt deze data om inzicht te krijgen in de problematiek van verkeersongevallen. Je deinst niet terug voor grote hoeveelheden data en zet ze probleemloos om in de juiste analyses, visualisaties en conclusies. Je verwerkt dit in rapportages die leesbaar en inzichtelijk zijn.

Samen met je collega’s zorg je voor een consistente manier van analyses. En wellicht zie je kansen voor verbetering van onze analyses, visualisaties en de kwaliteit van onze data.

De data analist heeft hierin een belangrijke taak om op basis van de juiste analyses tot de gewenste inzichten te komen. Daarnaast werk je veel samen met collega data analisten, onderzoekers, data engineers, de data manager en data scientists van de andere onderzoekthema’s binnen VeiligheidNL.

Ernstig letsel voorkomen is beter dan genezen. VeiligheidNL (het kenniscentrum letselpreventie) is daar iedere dag mee bezig. Wij zetten ons in om het leven van mensen veilig(er) te maken en stimuleren samen met onze partners veilig gedrag en een veilige leefomgeving, zodat de kans op ernstig letsel in alle fasen van een mensenleven verkleind wordt. Dit doen we binnen zes letselpreventiethema’s. We zijn aanwezig in alle fasen van een mensenleven vanaf de geboorte met het letselpreventiethema kinderveiligheid tot en met de laatste fase in een leven met het thema valpreventie bij ouderen. We zijn ook actief door het leven heen om gehoorschade door hard geluid terug te dringen, zetten stevig in op het terugdringen van sportblessures en dragen bij aan de verkeersveiligheid en veilig productgebruik in Nederland.

Vanuit ons kantoor in Amsterdam werken we met een team van ruim 70 collega’s samen met overheidsinstellingen en private organisaties. Wij zijn trots op onze open en professionele cultuur en we strijden voor maximale impact.

**Wat neem je mee?**

* WO werk- en denkniveau waarin onderzoeksmethodologie en epidemiologie goed zijn vertegenwoordigd.
* Ervaring op het gebied van SPSS, Python, R en/of vergelijkbare tooling. Ervaring met dashboarding, bijvoorbeeld PowerBI, is een pré.

**Max hours per week:** 38,00  

**Apply until:** 09/15/2024  


A fully funded PhD position is available at the Department of Animal Ecology, Netherlands Institute of Ecology, in the group of Dr. Melissah Rowe. The PhD candidate will work on an ERC-funded project where the overarching aim is to determine whether reproductive microbiomes impact host fitness and evolution in wild animals and reveal the role of host genetics and immune functioning in shaping reproductive microbiome variability.  

Over the last decade we have seen a veritable explosion of work on the microbiome. This work has revealed the importance of the microbial communities in the gut, oral cavity, and skin for host biology. Indeed, microbiomes are emerging as fundamental modulators of host phenotype, fitness, and evolution. But what about microbes in the reproductive system: how does the ‘reproductive microbiome’ impact host fitness and evolution? Which microbes have the largest effects? And what factors determine whether these microbes are present? Studies of host-associated microbial communities have largely ignored the reproductive microbiome, especially in wild animals. This ERC-funded project will address these outstanding questions in order to elucidate the causes and – more importantly – the consequences of variation in reproductive microbiomes.  


**What you will be doing**
In this project, the student will use quantitative genetics to test the hypotheses that (a) variation in the microbiome is linked to individual fitness in a wild population, and (b) microbiome diversity and/or composition is heritable. The successful candidate will make use of a wild house sparrow population residing on a remote island in the Atlantic (Lundy Island), where the genetic pedigree is of high density, allowing the estimation of quantitative genetic parameters from data of a few generations.  

The PhD position will involve fieldwork on wild birds to collect samples for the characterisation of host microbiomes and quantification of reproductive success of males and females, as well as laboratory analysis, bioinformatic and statistical analysis of data, manuscript preparation, and supervision of students. There is scope for the candidate to develop complementary avenues of research that may involve additional tasks.  


**What you will be contributing**
We are looking for a highly motivated, independent, and productive person, who thrives in a collaborative and international environment and is willing to work in the field and the lab and contribute intellectually to the project. The candidate should hold a MSc degree in ecology/evolution, molecular biology, microbial ecology, or a related discipline by the time of starting the position. The candidate must have excellent communication skills, including writing and presentation of research, and must be fluent in English, as this is the working language of the group.
Experience with bird field work is highly preferred; The candidate will be expected to, after initial training, conduct fieldwork on Lundy Island for a few months every year (https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/lundyisland/).
The candidate should also have an interest in quantitative analysis, be comfortable working with big datasets, and have some experience with R statistical software and linear mixed models.  


**What do we offer**
This PhD project will be embedded in the Rowe Group within the Department of Animal Ecology at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW), located in Wageningen, the Netherlands. The candidate will also work with the larger ERC project team, including postdocs and research assistants, based at the NIOO. The project will be in close collaboration with Dr Julia Schroeder (Julia.schroeder@imperial.ac.uk) from Imperial College London.
The student will receive training and supervision in all aspects of the work, from field work and molecular laboratory techniques, to statistical analysis and bioinformatics. We provide resources to join workshops aimed at improving specific skills e.g. bioinformatics, and for travel to conferences.
This is a temporary appointment, initially for 1 year and upon satisfaction to be prolonged for a maximum of 4 years (1.0 FTE).

**De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie!**

**Wie zoeken wij?**

Voor ons hoofdkantoor in Amersfoort zoeken wij per direct een AI Solutions Developer.

In deze rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verkennen en implementeren van de mogelijkheden van generative AI, zoals ChatGPT, om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren.

Je hebt een relevante WO-opleiding afgerond of bijna afgerond, zoals Informatica of Data Science, en beschikt over aantoonbare kennis en interesse op het gebied van AI, machine learning en data-analyse. Daarnaast heb je sterke analytische vaardigheden en ben je in staat om complexe technische problemen op te lossen. Ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python, R of Java is een vereiste, evenals kennis van cloud computing en ervaring met platforms zoals AWS, Azure of Google Cloud.

Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief samen te werken in een team zijn van essentieel belang. Je bent proactief, leergierig en kunt goed omgaan met veranderingen en uitdagingen. Daarnaast heb je een sterke drive om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en ICT-management.

**Wat ga je doen?**

Deze functie is nieuw binnen Lab21, wat betekent dat je een grote invloed hebt op de invulling ervan. Je zult een onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren. Als Junior ICT Manager speel je een belangrijke rol bij het implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen binnen ons bedrijf. Je werkt nauw samen met verschillende teams om de behoeften van de organisatie in kaart te brengen en technologische oplossingen aan te dragen. Je analyseert en optimaliseert bestaande systemen en processen en identificeert kansen om AI-technologieën toe te passen.

**Plaats in de organisatie:**

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

Werken binnen het beleidskader Jeugd brengt veel dynamiek met zich mee. Er spelen uitdagingen m.b.t. de bekostiging van de jeugdzorg, de instroom van jeugdigen in de jeugdzorg is ongekend groot en de problematiek wordt steeds complexer. Dit vraagt om interventies, maar ook om een beleidswijziging om de jeugdzorg op de lange termijn betaalbaar te houden. Onlangs is in de Raad de Leeuwarder Jeugd Agenda vastgesteld. In deze Jeugd Agenda staan zowel de interventies als ook de voorstellen voor wijzigingen in de regulering van de jeugdzorg. Beide vergen een analyse om te komen tot de juiste keuzes en monitoring om te kunnen observeren of de wijzigingen ook het gewenste effect hebben.

Je werkt hierin samen met collega’s met minder statistische kennis (medeonderzoekers, maar ook onze bestuurders). Je voert gesprekken met mensen die werken bij overheidsorganisaties om te inventariseren welke mogelijkheden en beperkingen er zijn voor data-analyse in het onderzoek en gebruikt deze inzichten voor het opstellen van een haalbaar plan van aanpak. Vervolgens zorg je ook tijdens de uitvoering van het onderzoek voor de succesvolle uitvoering van de geplande analyses en stuurt wanneer dat nodig is bij. Tot slot weet je de complexe uitkomsten te vertalen naar duidelijke aanbevelingen voor bijvoorbeeld de onderzochte partijen, Tweede Kamerleden en/of verantwoordelijk bewindspersonen.

**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Data zijn voor het werk van de Algemene Rekenkamer een essentieel bron van informatie. Doordat de Rijksoverheid de afgelopen jaren in sterke mate is gedigitaliseerd, zijn er steeds meer data beschikbaar die onmisbaar zijn voor onze audit en onderzoekswerkzaamheden. De Algemene Rekenkamer heeft wettelijke toegang tot al deze data. En gebruikt deze bijvoorbeeld voor het jaarlijkse verantwoordingsonderzoek om transparant inzicht te bieden in de financiële en bedrijfsvoering van de Rijksoverheid. In ons data-analyse team (de Data Hub) ontwikkel je informatieproducten om onze collega-onderzoekers te ondersteunen in hun werkzaamheden met relevante inzichten uit beschikbare databronnen.


Naast het programmeren en analyseren fungeer je als business informatie analist als schakel tussen de business en de data. Je zoekt het contact met je collega’s op, doorgrondt de klantvraag en identificeert de vraag achter de vraag. Je weet je weg te vinden in grote hoeveelheden data en kan hieruit de informatie destilleren die antwoord biedt op deze vragen. Je biedt oplossingen in de vorm van een eenmalige data-analyse of de ontwikkeling van generiek informatieproducten, zoals een periodieke rapportage of interactief dashboard die al snel onmisbaar worden in het werk van onze collega’s. Veel van ons werk bevat vertrouwelijke informatie en is voor intern gebruik. Maar twee openbare voorbeelden zijn:


* De coronarekening
* Ons geld ontcijferd


Het ontwikkelen doe je in samenwerking met onze data-engineers, ontwerpers en ook onderzoekers of accountants die als opdrachtgever of gebruiker betrokken zijn. We werken op dit moment vooral in R-(shiny) voor onze producten. We werken hard aan de inzet van producten of methodieken op basis van bijvoorbeeld PowerBI voor dashboards of een standaard werkwijze voor de uitrol van producten. Gezien de huidige samenstelling van het team gaat de voorkeur uit naar een kandidaat met de technische ervaring die nodig is om deze ontwikkelingen door te zetten.

Bijvoorbeeld een onderzoek bij de grootste subsidieverstrekkers van het rijk waar we de relevante data opvragen/onttrekken voor een probleemanalyse. Deze kan als input kan dienen voor een verdiepend (meer kwalitatief) onderzoek.

Wil jij werken in een dynamische omgeving met werk wat er echt toe doet? Ben jij die Projectleider die de MIVD op IV/ICT gebied verder kan helpen? Lees dan verder!



De Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD) is gericht op het tijdig leveren van een geïntegreerd actueel, betrouwbaar, onpartijdig, voorspellend en exclusief product (strategisch, tactisch en operationeel) op het gebied van inlichtingen, contra-inlichtingen en veiligheid. De MIVD doet dit primair voor de ondersteuning van de besluitvorming door de politieke, ambtelijke en militaire leiding van Defensie, maar ook andere afnemers worden bediend.



De MIVD maakt onderdeel uit van het Ministerie van Defensie. De dienst ondersteunt bij het gereedstellen van onze eenheden en bij militaire missies door het tijdig leveren van betrouwbare inlichtingen. Dit vindt plaats in nationaal en internationaal verband.



De MIVD bestaat, naast een directie, uit stafafdelingen, operationele afdelingen en ondersteunende afdelingen. Je komt te werken bij de Unit IT. Een hoogwaardige IV/ICT-omgeving is voor de MIVD van vitaal belang. De Unit IT is de leverancier van eigentijdse informatiesystemen ter ondersteuning van de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsprocessen van de MIVD. Kernwaarden zijn daarbij klantgerichtheid, adaptief vermogen en resultaatgerichtheid (effectief, efficiënt, veilig en rechtmatig). In de praktijk is er sprake van multidisciplinaire IT-teams die integraal verantwoordelijk zijn voor een groep van diensten, applicaties en systemen. De unit omvat tevens de disciplines business analyse en architectuur. Ook worden nationaal en internationaal relaties onderhouden op het gebied van informatievoorziening, in het bijzonder ten behoeve van militaire operaties en voert de unit IT-projecten uit.



Werken bij de MIVD is interessant, soms spannend maar bovenal werk dat er toe doet! Je komt in aanraking met nieuwe technologische ontwikkelingen en krijgt opdrachten die het beste in jou naar boven halen.



Taken  

Als projectleider vorm je een belangrijke schakel in de optimale samenhang tussen de inlichtingen- en bedrijfsprocessen en IT en werk je aan de voortdurende verbetering hiervan. Jij brengt vernieuwing en realiserend vermogen in een omgeving die voortdurend in beweging is. De projectleider zal worden belast met alle aspecten van de uitvoering van IV- en ICT-projecten. Dit loopt van het initiëren, definiëren, ontwerpen en voorbereiden van deze projecten, via het daadwerkelijk leiden van (complexe) projecten en het implementeren en realiseren van de plannen, tot het verzorgen van nazorg en het afsluiten van projecten. Het betreft projecten van variërende omvang.  

Je geeft op effectieve en transparante wijze leiding aan multidisciplinaire teams en houdt toezicht op werk van derden. Jouw drijfveer is om de MIVD nieuwe mogelijkheden te bieden om de dienst op kortere en middellange termijn effectiever te maken. Ook benut jij kansen die zich aandienen door technologische ontwikkelingen, bijvoorbeeld door innovatie te stimuleren. Met je solide achtergrond ben je in staat verschillende rollen te vervullen, bijvoorbeeld die van adviseur, (deel)projectleider, kwaliteitsbewaker of system integrator.  

Als persoon ben je nieuwsgierig en zoek je naar de laatste mogelijkheden in de markt en luister je naar ideeën uit de eigen organisatie. Jij weet deze op waarde te schatten en kansen te identificeren alsook de strategische en de praktische implicaties van verbeteringen duidelijk voor het voetlicht te brengen. Je treedt daarbij op als verbinder tussen de verschillende technische specialisten, de (DevOps) teams en de vertegenwoordigers van de gebruikersorganisatie. Dit alles met oog voor de uitdagingen van vandaag en de ambities van de toekomst.



Deze functie is geplaatst in onze locatie Eibergen, waar je veel samenwerkt in een groeiend team met een brede taak. Het accent ligt binnen het team op netwerk- server- en werkplek-beheer en technisch en functioneel applicatiebeheer, binnen een complexe omgeving met specifieke systemen / applicaties. Omdat het een kleinere locatie met beperkte specialistische functies betreft wordt van je verwacht dat je het geen probleem vindt om regelmatig de inhoud in te duiken, vooral in de opstartfase van een project. Je werkt daarbij onder andere samen met een analist, een informatiebeveiligings-expert en ICT-beheerders. Met de servicemanager stem je de overdracht vanuit project naar beheer af. Je onderhoudt een nauwe band met je collega-projectleiders en andere collega’s die op een andere locatie werkzaam zijn, onder andere over de werkwijze rond projecten.



We zijn het Scaled Agile Framwork (SAFe) aan het implementeren en je denkt met ons mee over de rol die de projectleider hierin in de toekomst heeft. Dit kan betekenen dat je rol er anders uit komt te zien met de jaren.

-------------------------------------------------------



Defensie  

Het ministerie van Defensie is een operationele en uitvoerende organisatie. Hoofddoel is het gereed stellen en beschikbaar houden van operationele eenheden en de succesvolle inzet daarvan, zowel in nationaal als internationaal verband.



Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD)



De Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD) is onderdeel van het ministerie van Defensie. De dienst ondersteunt bij het gereedstellen van de eenheden en bij militaire missies en vredesoperaties. Hiervoor verwerven we wereldwijd inlichtingen en veiligheidsinformatie op strategisch, tactisch en operationeel niveau. De MIVD speelt zo een cruciale rol bij de besluitvorming door de militaire leiding en de politieke top.



Werk je bij de MIVD, dan doe je werk dat er echt toe doet. Je draagt bij aan het beschermen van de Nederlandse belangen en de nationale veiligheid. Bovendien werk je in een zeer dynamische omgeving.

Defensie  

Het ministerie van Defensie is een operationele en uitvoerende organisatie. Hoofddoel is het gereed stellen en beschikbaar houden van operationele eenheden en de succesvolle inzet daarvan, zowel in nationaal als internationaal verband.



Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD)



De Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD) is onderdeel van het ministerie van Defensie. De dienst ondersteunt bij het gereedstellen van de eenheden en bij militaire missies en vredesoperaties.

De MIVD speelt zo een cruciale rol bij de besluitvorming door de militaire leiding en de politieke top.



Werk je bij de MIVD, dan doe je werk dat er echt toe doet. Je draagt bij aan het beschermen van de Nederlandse belangen en de nationale veiligheid. Bovendien werk je in een zeer dynamische omgeving. We doen er alles aan om te zorgen dat je op jouw vakgebied up-to-date blijft, bijvoorbeeld door middel van opleidingen en kennisuitwisseling met onze partnerdiensten.



Omdat je bij de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdienst werkt en met gevoelige informatie te maken krijgt, kun je de inhoud van je werk niet met je vrienden en familie bespreken. Maar wel met je collega’s. Daarom bouw je een bijzondere band op met hen. Er heerst een sterke onderlinge verbondenheid die er mede voor zorgt dat de meeste mensen lang bij de organisatie blijven werken. En allemaal werken we aan hetzelfde doel: de fysieke en digitale veiligheid van 17 miljoen Nederlanders.

JBS ondersteunt de business in de acceptatie en het dagelijks gebruik van IV-oplossingen en organiseert het proces om dit mogelijk te maken.

### **Bijzonderheden**


Wees terughoudend met het bekendmaken dat u voor de MIVD wilt werken. Dit levert mogelijk risico’s voor u op.  

Een veiligheidsonderzoek is onderdeel van de sollicitatieprocedure.

**About the team:**
  

  

Markel International operates in the Wholesale insurance market, via the Lloyd's platform in London, as well as in Commercial SME markets through the National Markets ('NM') division, with offices across the UK, Canada, and Europe. The NM Analytics team works across the entire NM division and is a multi-disciplinary team consisting of data scientists, data engineers and actuaries.
  

  

The team is embedded within the business and works closely on a day-to-day basis with expert underwriters, claims handlers, finance, actuarial, sales, operations, and management. This close interaction is key to delivering detailed solutions quickly, to the people that need them.
  

  

The team is organised into three pillars: Data Science & Engineering, Portfolio Management and Technical Pricing.

Specifically, the role will focus on supporting diverse product lines across NM to drive our growth ambitions to 2030, whilst maintaining underwriting profitability.
  

  

The NM Analytics team has strong a track record in cloud data engineering and data science. The team will support you with the creation and implementation of data pipelines and data models, ensuring the highest standard in data quality, integrity, and governance, as we seek to minimise time spent on data cleaning and preparation. However, some data wrangling skills, along with knowledge of Python and SQL, are required for this role, as we endeavour to build reproducible data and model workflows using leading cloud technology.
  

  

Working together to achieve this will allow you to focus on the key day-to-day tasks, including assisting with individual risk pricing, development and maintenance of pricing models, portfolio modelling, profitability analysis and the production of management information across the business. You will work to analyse our ever-developing data, telling the story and delivering insights from our emerging experience to key stakeholders such as the reserving team, finance, and management.
  

  

A solid understanding of statistics is key; the candidate could have a background in statistics, actuarial science, or data science for example. As we expand our business, we look to continuously improve upon our existing pricing methodologies. A desire to investigate new technologies and modelling techniques will be an advantage for this role.
  

  

**What we ask of you:**
  

  

The candidate will support both the NM Lead Pricing Expert and the local offices through working on the following:

In het Operations-domein ondersteun je onze winkels, supply chain en e-commerce Operations met analytics en data Science-oplossingen. Zo maken we onze operatie nog efficiënter en duurzamer met integrale supply chain-oplossingen en operationele procesoptimalisaties zoals routing, slotting en planning.

* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse-aanpakken; je gaat creatief op zoek naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* Jouw verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen van data-analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

* Een afgeronde WO-opleiding met data- en/of statistische basis zoals Econometrie, Operations Research, Wiskunde, Informatica of Business Analytics
* Circa 0 – 2 jaar werkervaring als Analyst of equivalent
* Ervaring met werken met grote databases (SQL / PySpark)
* Ervaring met het oplossen van business vraagstukken met data analytics en/of data science technieken d.m.v. Python / R. Dit is een must!
* Ervaring met object georiënteerd programmeren (Python/Javascript) is een pre
* Ervaring met visualisatie tools zoals Power BI is een pre
 **En, niet onbelangrijk, ben je:**  

* Proactief; je geeft zowel gevraagd als ongevraagd advies
* Sterk in het adviseren van de business en meenemen van stakeholders
* Communicatief sterk; je weet complexe informatie aan een niet-technisch publiek uit te leggen

Een data junkie bij Victa denkt in codes (SQL, Python), ziet in alles structuren en datamodellering (Kimball, Data Vault) of is verslaafd aan data analytics. En omdat een echte data junkie zich niet makkelijk laat definiëren of in een hokje drukken hebben we bij Victa niet zozeer functies maar rollen en specialisaties die je kunt vervullen.

  



**Rollen van een data junkie:**

* Data Analytics Consultant (BI Consultant)
* Data Engineer / Developer (DevOps)

**Wat wij je bieden?**

  

  

Wij faciliteren je volledig in je data begeerte en stimuleren je geest door je te laten werken aan uitdagende opdrachten en met gave klanten. We hebben een dynamische en innovatieve klantgerichte outside-in organisatie waarbij we met markt leidende software en oplossing het beste voor onze klanten bereiken. Dit doe je natuurlijk niet alleen maar met een team van vakidioten die net zo verslaafd zijn aan data.


Afkicken is wat ons betreft ook niet nodig. We leven in een wereld waarin data steeds belangrijker is en bieden je daarom een zekere toekomst. Om voorop te blijven lopen in de markt experimenteren wij continu met nieuwe ontwikkelingen en zoeken we steeds naar nieuwe verslavingsgebieden.

De overgang naar duurzame en betrouwbare energievoorziening brengt flinke uitdagingen met zich mee. Dat vraagt om slimmer werken en nieuwe oplossingen. Daarom heeft Alliander in haar operationele afdelingen veranderteams zitten die samen met de business deze noodzakelijke veranderingen mogelijk maken.


Jij gaat aan de slag binnen en het team ProjectPuzzler. Het ProjectPuzzler team ontwikkelt en beheert een optimizer tool voor de planning van monteurs op projecten voor de realisatieketens, zoals GVR&N, Onderhoud & Storingen, en de resourceplanning van Strategische Resource Management. Via deze tool werkt het team nauw samen met het operationele team in (planners en projectmanagers) om de voorbereidingsfase (3-24 weken tot uitvoer) van de planning uit te voeren. Ons doel is om voldoende, waardevoller en planbaar werk naar de uitvoering te brengen.


Samen met BCG hebben we de Proof of Concept (PoC) fase afgerond en het project is op dit moment in de MVP-fase. Het team is nu opgesplitst in een business- en een development team, vanwege het grote aantal betrokken analisten, data scientists en data engineers. Jouw rol is om ervoor te zorgen dat beide teams goed op elkaar zijn afgestemd. Samen met de scrum master zorg je ervoor dat het team na deze fase samensmelt tot één scrum team, waar jij de Product Owner van wordt.


Het energienet van de toekomst maken we voor iedereen, mét iedereen . En als Product Owner werk jij hieraan mee. Zo ben jij bezig met het:

* ontwikkelen van een visie en deze samen met het team omzetten in acties met als doel kort-cyclisch zoveel mogelijk waarde te realiseren.
* prioriteren van de backlog met als doel focus aan te brengen in een overzichtelijke roadmap van het ontwikkelteam.
* het bedenken en uitvoeren van de juiste implementatiestrategie; enthousiasmeren en inspireren van het ontwikkelteam en stakeholders.
* uitdragen van de AGILE werkwijze om in samenwerking met je scrummaster een zelfsturend team neer te zetten.
* afstemmen met andere Product Owners van andere teams om zo afhankelijkheden tussen teams beheersbaar te maken.

**Jij maakt het net completer bij Alliander**

Wist je dat we bij Alliander uit verschillende bedrijven bestaan? Samen met Liander, Qirion, Qterra, Dep, Firan en Entrnce ontwikkelen én beheren we het energienet voor miljoenen inwoners van Nederland. En met de huidige energietransitie is dat hard werken. Dat doen we met de hulp van ruim 8.000 vakmensen. Dankzij deze talenten hebben wij het volste vertrouwen in de energietoekomst van Nederland. Samen met jou maken wij dat mogelijk.


Een mindset waarin alleen het beste goed genoeg is, kan alleen als jij genoeg energie hebt. En de juiste werkomgeving geeft jou dat. Als Product Owner werk je vanuit één van de veranderteams binnen Grootverbruik, Grote Werkpakketten, Kleinverbruik, Onderhoud & Storingen of Strategisch Resource Management. Daar werk je aan mooie verbeterprojecten met betrokken & eerlijke collega’s!

**Jij maakt het net energieker**


Werken aan een organisatie die toekomstproof is. Dat doe je vanuit je eigen kracht en talent. En dat doe je bij ons. Draag jij daaraan bij met jouw flexibiliteit in een veranderende omgeving? Super! Zeker als je dit aanvult met:

* een aantal jaren ervaring als Product Owner binnen een complexe en uitdagende omgeving
* WO werk- en denkniveau;
* ervaring met advanced analytics tools/ it-producten;
* minimaal 5 jaar ervaring met SAFe of Scrum; certificering als Product Owner is een sterke pré.
* affiniteit met de energiewereld en data-sience.

**Voor jou net beter geregeld**


Daarvoor krijg jij op basis van een 38-urige werkweek:

* een salaris van € 4.955,- tot € 6.800,- bruto per maand.
* jaarlijks een individueel keuze budget (IKB) van 18% (fulltime) of 12,8% (parttime) van je bruto jaarsalaris. Dit is inclusief 8% vakantietoeslag. Je kunt dit bedrag uit laten betalen, maar je kunt er bijvoorbeeld ook extra vrije dagen voor kopen. Jij kiest wat bij jou past.
* een eindejaarsuitkering in december van 6% van de uitbetaalde maandsalarissen in het huidige kalenderjaar.
* een pensioenopbouw bij ABP, speciaal voor de overheid en het onderwijs. Wij betalen 70% van jouw pensioenpremie.
* werken waar dit voor jou het beste werkt, als je functie dit toelaat. Vanaf kantoor of vanuit eigen huis. Werk je vanuit huis, dan ontvang je hiervoor een thuiswerktegemoetkoming.

Our main office is in Rotterdam next to the iconic Erasmus bridge. We work hybrid with a minimum of 2 days a week at the office, Mondays in Rotterdam and Thursday in Amsterdam.You’re also able to work from other KPN offices and working from home is also supported.

* You are able to explain your solution in layman's terms

**Wat krijg je**
**van ons?**
-----------------------------


Of course, as an employer, we also have a lot to offer you. Here’s what you can expect from us:

* A gross monthly salary ranging from a minimum of €4.478,- to a maximum of € 6.734,- based on a 37-hour work week, offcourse depending on your work experience,
* Flexible working hours up to 40 hours per week, potentially increasing your gross salary by up to 8.5%.

**Vorm de onmisbare schakel in de energiemarkt**


#### **Werk vol energie**

  


Base64 is een enthousiast team binnen de waardestroom IT Foundation. Het team is verantwoordelijk voor de oplevering van generieke bouwblokken op het gebied van integratie. De bouwblokken worden gebruikt door de EDSN DevOps-teams. Een essentieel onderdeel van de oplossingen die worden aangeboden is Self Service (bij voorkeur declaratief via GitOps). Dit houdt in dat teams de bouwblokken kunnen gebruiken zonder dat ze afhankelijk zijn van IT Foundation. Ons team is dienstverlenend en heeft veel contact met andere teams, we letten daarom ook op de benodigde softskills.



Naast Base64 zijn team Spark, WhoAmI en Fundamentum onderdeel van deze waardestroom. Spark heeft als scope cloud (AWS) infrastructuur, observability en delivery pipelines. WhoAmI is verantwoordelijk voor Identity & Access Management. Fundamentum houdt zich bezig met data-engineering en data analytics.

  


Een kernaspect binnen IT Foundation is bouwblokken op te leveren die zorgen voor business wendbaarheid en snelheid van realisatie (time-to-market). Kortom, wendbare oplossingen die in snelle korte en kleine iteraties ontwikkeld kunnen worden (integrate early & integrate often + working complex systems evolve from simple working systems

  

#### **Dit ga je doen**


* **Verbetering van bouwblokken voor teams:** Je ontwikkelt en verfijnt bouwblokken die teams binnen het bedrijf kunnen gebruiken om efficiënter te werken en betere resultaten te behalen. Door constant te itereren en te verbeteren, help je bij het creëren van een robuuste en flexibele technologische basis.
* **Beheer van de API-gateway:**  

Als beheerder van de API-gateway zorg je ervoor dat de communicatie tussen verschillende systemen soepel verloopt en dat de veiligheid en betrouwbaarheid van de API's worden gehandhaafd. Je voert regelmatig onderhoud uit en implementeert best practices om ervoor te zorgen dat de gateway optimaal presteert.
* **Uitbreiding van Kafka-infrastructuur:** Je werkt aan het uitbreiden van de Kafka-infrastructuur, met behulp van Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK), om te voldoen aan de groeiende vraag naar real-time gegevensverwerking en -uitwisseling. Door schaalbaarheid en betrouwbaarheid te waarborgen, draag je bij aan de veerkracht van het systeem.
* **Ontwikkeling van File Gateway voor gegevensuitwisseling:** Je draagt bij aan de ontwikkeling van de File Gateway, een essentieel onderdeel binnen de energie sector voor het uitwisselen van datasets. Door te werken aan verbeteringen en nieuwe functionaliteiten, help je bij het faciliteren van naadloze gegevensuitwisseling en samenwerking binnen de sector.
* **Samenwerking en backlogbeheer:** Je werkt nauw samen met het team en de product owner om ervoor te zorgen dat de backlog van taken goed wordt beheerd en voorbereid is voor uitvoering. Door effectieve communicatie en planning zorg je ervoor dat het team zijn doelen kan bereiken en waarde kan leveren aan de organisatie.
* **Samenwerking met DevOps-teams:** Je werkt samen met andere DevOps-teams om ervoor te zorgen dat de ontwikkelde bouwblokken en infrastructuren naadloos aansluiten bij de behoeften van andere teams. Door middel van overleg en samenwerking help je bij het creëren van een geïntegreerd ecosysteem van tools en processen.
* **Implementatie van CI/CD-pipelines en GitOps-proces:** Je bouwt en onderhoudt Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines om applicaties snel en betrouwbaar naar productie te brengen. Met behulp van een declaratief GitOps-proces, zoals helm en argo, automatiseer je implementaties en zorg je voor consistente en herhaalbare releases.


**Gedreven op het maken van impact**
------------------------------------


#### **Hier krijg je energie van**

  


Jij bent een breed inzetbare Platform Engineer met een can-do mentaliteit, die geïnspireerd wordt door een innovatieve omgeving zoals we hebben bij team Base64. Je bent een DevOps-er die het werk wat je oplevert ook daadwerkelijk owned. Je hebt een primaire focus op ontwikkeling (DEV) en een klein deel op OPS. Het DEV-werk dient dusdanig te zijn uitgevoerd, dat er bijna geen OPS-werk nodig is.


#### **Dit neem verder je mee**


* Je hebt een nieuwsgierige geest als het gaat om het verkennen van nieuwe technologieën, ongeacht of je al een doorgewinterde medior bent of een ervaren senior.
* Ervaring in softwareontwikkeling, bij voorkeur met Golang, waarbij je als medior al enige ervaring hebt en als senior diepgaande expertise hebt ontwikkeld.
* Vertrouwdheid met het GitOps-concept (alles als code), waarbij je als medior je kennis aan het opbouwen bent en als senior al een stevige basis hebt in het implementeren van GitOps-praktijken.
* Ervaring met het beheren van Kubernetes, met name Red Hat Openshift, en Kubernetes Operators, waarbij je als medior al begint te navigeren en als senior een schat aan ervaring hebt opgebouwd.
* Kennis van Gitlab CI-pipelines en het uitrollen met ArgoCD, waarbij je als medior je eerste stappen zet en als senior al volledig vertrouwd bent met deze tools.
* Begrip van netwerkprotocollen, inclusief load balancers, (m)TLS, certificaatbeheer en DNS, waarbij je als medior je kennis aan het uitbreiden bent en als senior een diepgaand begrip hebt ontwikkeld.
* Ervaring met monitoringtools zoals Grafana en Prometheus, waarbij je als medior begint te experimenteren en als senior uitgebreide ervaring hebt.
* Je bent van nature een teamspeler, waarbij je als medior graag samenwerkt en als senior anderen begeleidt en ondersteunt.
* Een HBO-diploma is vereist, maar we hechten vooral waarde aan je intrinsieke motivatie en passie voor technologie, ongeacht je ervaringsniveau.


#### **Pre's**


* Ervaring met Terraform
* Ervaring met AWS
* Ervaring met (C)IAM
* Een WO-diploma.



Als je nog niet aan alle vereisten voldoet, moedigen we je nog steeds aan om te solliciteren en je enthousiasme te tonen voor het leren en groeien in deze rol.

Office**Job Description**

**Applications Development Scientist Transmission Electron Microscopes**


Our Mission is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. As one team of 100,000+ colleagues, we share a common set of values - Integrity, Intensity, Innovation, and Involvement - working together to accelerate research, solve complex scientific challenges, drive technological innovation, and support patients in need.


Innovative materials play essential roles in safety, clean energy, transportation, human health, and industrial productivity. To fuel continued innovation, researchers want to deepen their understanding of the physical and chemical properties of materials (morphological, structural, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical). Whether discovering new materials, solving analytical problems, improving processes, or assuring product quality, electron microscopy can provide insight at all scales and modalities. The discoveries resulting from materials science research help enhance researchers’ ability to successfully correlate structural properties with functional performance. In turn, this insight helps commercial enterprises innovate products and processes to gain important time-to-market and cost advantages.


At Thermo Fisher Scientific, Diversity & Inclusion is vital to the future success of our organization. It is not just something we do; it is who we are. It enables our colleagues to openly share the wide range of perspectives they represent, creating an environment where differences are truly valued, authenticity is a state-of-being, and everyone feels they belong and can do their best work.

Wij maken van Albert Heijn het beste omnichannel Food & Tech bedrijf en willen digitaal gemak voor iedereen. We testen en experimenteren, zijn innovatief en verleggen grenzen. Voor die reis hebben wij het Data Talent Track. Een track waarin wij jouw carrière als Data Analyst bij Albert Heijn een vliegende start geven binnen onze Digital Analytics afdeling. Is dit echt iets voor jou? Word dan de nieuwe Data Analyst in ons Data Talent Track!

  

  

**Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst ken jij onze klant het beste. Deze kennis verkrijg je door gebruik te maken van data (zoals bijvoorbeeld data over koopgedrag), om zo de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van data-oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk met de nieuwste data analytics technieken. Je maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Analytics & Data Science team, en bent daarmee onderdeel van de grotere Analytics community binnen Albert Heijn. Je beweegt makkelijk tussen Tech, Data Science en de business teams, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data analytics toepassingen. Je maakt impact als Data Analist door:

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

  



**Dit doe je als Data Analyst Digital**

Het Digital domein richt zich op digitale relevantie, experimentation, eCommerce en klantloyaliteit. Hiervoor voeren we data-analyses uit of ontwikkelen wij dataproducten om onze e-commerce en Digital-afdelingen te ondersteunen met inzichten rondom onze klanten, het verbeteren van e-commerce en het verbeteren van de customer journey. Denk daarbij aan projecten zoals het relevanter maken van onze aanbiedingen (Mijn Bonus Box) of marketing, inzichtelijk maken van de omnichannel customer journeys en het analyseren van onze spaarprogramma’s.

  



**Jouw ontwikkeling in het Data Talent Track**


Het Data Talent Track is een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen die je helpen om jouw professionele vaardigheden te ontwikkelen. Zo zijn er trainingen zoals persoonlijk leiderschap en het efficiënter schrijven van code, maar ga je bijvoorbeeld ook een dagje meehelpen in de winkel of bouw je mee aan de ideeën van de toekomst in een Hackathon. Wil je meer weten over hoe het Data Talent Track eruitziet? Neem dan vooral ook eens een kijkje hier.

 **Dit breng je mee**


Als grootste supermarkt van Nederland vullen we met meer dan 100.000 medewerkers dagelijks zo'n 5 miljoen borden. En als het aan ons ligt, doen we dat binnenkort ook samen met jou als onze Data Analyst. Zeker als je de broodnodige pro-activiteit en resultaatgerichtheid naar Albert Heijn meebrengt. Jij bent gedreven, staat sterk in je schoen en de ambitie spat van je af. Ook heb je:

En, niet onbelangrijk, ben je:

* Proactief; je geeft zowel gevraagd als ongevraagd advies
* Sterk in het adviseren van de business en meenemen van stakeholders
* Communicatief sterk; je weet complexe informatie aan een niet-technisch publiek uit te leggen

 **De beste ingrediënten voor een betekenisvolle baan**

* Een salaris van max € 4000,- per periode van 4 weken (afhankelijk van je ervaring)
* Een winstuitkering oplopend van 45 tot 130% van je gemiddelde periodesalaris

We sparen samen voor een heel goed pensioen. En wij betalen ruim 5 keer zo veel als jij. Zo ben je ook later verzekerd van een goed inkomen* Je kunt 45 (ja, vijfenveertig) dagen vrij nemen; 25,5 vaste vakantiedagen en 19,5 ADV dagen. Veel plezier!
* Je ontwikkelt je even snel als de tech waar we mee werken. Dankzij feedback loops met de best & the brightest tech savvy collega’s. En door actief bij te dragen aan de AH Technology community – plons in een zee aan kennis en inzichten!

* Een werkgever die het beste van twee werelden combineert: de kansen die je met een corporate associeert plus de autonomie en de “to boldly go where no person has gone before” drive die scale-ups kenmerkt
* De kans om miljoenen mensen gezonder, lekkerder en makkelijker te laten eten

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack.

Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)

**Fijne pre's:**

* Kennis van jaarrekeningcontrole

----------------


Are you a bachelor student within a technical study, such as Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, and are you looking for an apprentice internship? Do you enjoy programming? Are you skilled in MATLAB or Python? Would you like to apply your theoretical knowledge in a real world setting and gain some practical experience? Then this internship might be interesting to you!

**Background information**
--------------------------


The Metrology Leveling department is part of the Development and Engineering sector of ASML. Our primary focus is on measuring each silicon wafer prior to exposure inside the Twinscan, generating a surface map with nanometer precision. In addition, we also play a role in the calibration of the Twinscan itself and maintain the control of the ""measure sequence"", which includes both our measurements and those from other departments, such as Horizontal Alignment. Stage alignment (SA) is the functionality that is used to determine the position (and shape) of plates of the wafer stage with respect to the metro frame. These plates are used as a reference for other measurements - both on measure and on expose side. Which plate or plates are measured, on which plate reticle alignment is done and the type of measure sequence (Production, Robust, etc.) differs per platform.

**Your assignment**
-------------------


With the introduction of a new Stage Alignment sequence in software, we also need to update the diagnostics tool used to analyze and visualize data from the machine. One of the biggest diagnostics tools, FlatNG, needs to be updated to handle the analysis and visualization of data from this new sequence. This will allow customers to help troubleshoot their systems themselves or with the help of the local office. Therefore, this assignment consists of adding this new functionality to the diagnostics tool. Additionally, some other tasks may include fixing bugs in the tool or even attempting to link the measure sequence and stage alignment sequence tooling dashboards.

**Your profile**
----------------


To be a match for this internship, you:

* Are busy with your bachelor's in Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, or in a related technical study;
* Are skilled in MATLAB and/or Python;
* Are solution oriented and have a hands-on mentality;
* Have logical reasoning and a proactive mindset;
* Have good communication skills in English (verbal and written).


This is an apprentice internship for 4-5 days a week (3 days onsite) with a duration of 3 to 6 months. The start date is as soon as possible, October 2024.

**Please note that we can only consider students who are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship.**

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Je gaat werken als journalist/redacteur voor **Assurantie Magazine (AM),** het grootste onafhankelijke nieuwsplatform voor financieel dienstverleners. Van verzekeraar tot hypotheekverstrekker en van schadebehandelaar tot pensioenadviseur; AM is al ruim 40 jaar de go-to nieuwsbron voor de verzekeringsbranche. Het is een competitieve, dynamische wereld vol botsende belangen, maar ook een branche met talloze mooie innovaties en maatschappelijke uitdagingen, zoals: hoe verzekeren we de energietransitie, en de steeds grotere cybercrime dreiging?


In deze rol:


* Draag jij met je spraakmakende, diepgravende artikelen en scoops bij aan structurele groei van het aantal betalende abonnees.
* Werk je voor AMweb.nl, waarmee je focus op digitale media ligt en je mede op basis van data je vervolgstappen bepaalt.
* Ben je binnen de redactie owner van je eigen dossiers die vallen onder belangrijke thema’s voor de verzekeringsbranche.
* Ben je als journalist actief betrokken bij de sector. Je kent onze doelgroep door en door, en je onderhoudt je netwerk goed.

* Je hebt journalistieke ervaring, en een portfolio van artikelen en verhalen waar je trots op bent.
* Je bent nieuwsgierig, onderzoekend en kritisch en verdiept je graag in de hete hangijzers en trends binnen de branche.
* Je houdt van de afwisseling die werken op een redactie meebrengt, je vindt het leuk mee te denken over en te schakelen tussen het schrijven van nieuwsberichten en scoops enerzijds en inhoudelijke artikelen die diepgravend onderzoek vragen anderzijds.
* Je hebt kennis van de financiële dienstverlening, of bovengemiddelde interesse en de wil om snel alles te weten te komen over onze doelgroep.


**Ons aanbod**


* Bij VMN kom je om te leren, de ruimte om je journalistieke ideeën te realiseren, en voor de goede werk/privé balans. Wij werken hybride en je hebt veel vrijheid om je eigen werkweek in te delen.
* Wij organiseren veel sociale en inhoudelijke bijeenkomsten, waar je ook de andere VMN collega’s ontmoet, zo kun je leren van en ervaringen uitwisselen met andere journalisten/redacteuren en externe sprekers of trainers. Hoogwaardige journalistiek is de kern van onze organisatie: hierin investeren vinden we belangrijk.

 **Vacature**

**Communicatiemedewerker GGD** **(24 uur)**

 **Hoe ziet jouw toekomstige werkdag eruit?**  

Je start de werkdag goed met een lekkere kop koffie. Samen met je collega’s praat je bij over het weekend. Maar niet te lang, want aan het begin van de ochtend heb je meteen de weekstart van de GGD. Samen met je communicatiecollega’s bespreek je welke gezondheidsonderwerpen je de komende periode uitlicht. Dit doe je aan de hand van de omgevingsscan waarop je aanhaakt bij de behoefte van de inwoners, de contentplanning en ons jaarplan.


Hierna ga je gelijk aan de slag met het maken van content. De nieuwe social mediacampagne moet namelijk vandaag worden ingepland. Jij weet als geen ander hoe je met creatieve content de doelgroep kan bereiken. Naast je eigen kennis en ervaring, gebruik je hierbij de data en resultaten van eerdere, gelijksoortige campagnes.


De tijd vliegt en voor je het weet is het lunchtijd. Je loopt een rondje met je collega’s om even de benen te strekken. Als je terugkomt start een online meeting met een projectleider over een nieuwe voorlichtingscampagne. Je stelt vragen over doel, doelgroep en adviseert vervolgens over middelen.


Na de meeting neem je de tijd om je mail bij te werken. Je ontving een vraag van een journalist. Samen met de inhoudsdeskundige die de woordvoering doet, formuleer je de antwoorden op de vragen. Later deze week begeleid je het persmoment. Het laatste uur voer je een maandelijkse analyse uit om het gebruikersgedrag op de websites in beeld te brengen. Dit geeft weer nieuwe inzichten om de website te optimaliseren. Voldaan klap je je laptop dicht en verheug je je op morgen. Want morgen is weer een nieuwe dag die totaal anders kan zijn!

**Wat ga je doen?**  

Binnen onze veiligheidsregio hebben we de unieke combinatie van gezondheid (GGD) én veiligheid (Brandweer, Crisisbeheersing). Als communicatiemedewerker richt jij je op operationele taken van de GGD. Jouw werkgebied is breed en omvat afgebakende, uitvoerende werkzaamheden waarbij je nauw samenwerkt en spart met je communicatiecollega's.


Daarnaast zijn we een crisisorganisatie, wat betekent dat je ook bereid bent deel te nemen aan een communicatiepiket tijdens crisissituaties. Gemiddeld ben je 8 tot 10 keer per jaar een week lang bereikbaar en beschikbaar voor communicatieve werkzaamheden tijdens crisissituaties. Dit doe je samen met andere collega's die piket hebben die week.

**Jouw taken:**

* Content creatie: realiseren van boeiend en inspirerende content voor onze online en offline kanalen.
* Verhalen vertellen: complexe info omzetten in begrijpelijke en pakkende verhalen die onze doelgroep raken en betrekken.
* Social media: beheren van social media kanalen, toffe posts maken en interactie aangaan met onze volgers.
* Content organiseren: campagnes plannen en coördineren die ons merk en werk in de spotlight zetten.
* Huisstijl bewaken: bewaken en versterken van onze huisstijl in alle communicatie-uitingen
* Media contacten: opbouwen en onderhouden van relaties met de media, en zorgen voor positieve publiciteit en zichtbaarheid.
* Data checken: communicatiekanalen en communicatiecampagnes analyseren en data gebruiken om onze strategieën te verbeteren.
* Samenwerken: met verschillende teams en vormgever om communicatieprojecten van start tot finish te brengen.

**Wat breng je mee?**

* Diploma in communicatie of een vergelijkbare studie.
* Ervaring met traditionele en moderne communicatiemiddelen en campagnes.
* Top skills voor het maken pakkende teksten en beelden waarmee je onze doelgroep raakt.
* Sterk in vormgeving en bekend met tools, zoals Canva.
* Creatief brein met scherp oog voor detail.
* Sterke verbale en schriftelijke communicatie.
* Zelfstarter met een proactieve mindset.
* Analytisch vermogen om social media en websitedata om te zetten in slimme(re) communicatie.
* Echte teamplayer die graag samenwerkt.
* Passie voor verhalen vertellen en het bouwen van een sterk merk.
* Coachende vaardigheden en het vermogen om collega's te begeleiden en afdelingen te ondersteunen bij hun communicatie.

**Jouw team:**  

Je werkt in een leuk en enthousiast communicatieteam met 12 collega’s. Een team dat grotendeels bestaat uit jonge professionals, maar ook met enkele collega’s die al langer in het vak zitten. We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**  

Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA. Je komt te werken in een crisisorganisatie vol afwisseling. De coronacrisis, vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne, het hoogwater van de Maas of een grote brand. Wij waren erbij betrokken. Als communicatiemedewerker zit je bij ons nooit stil.


Je kunt je eigen werktijden en werkplek bepalen. Wij werken vanuit vertrouwen waarbij vrijheden en verantwoordelijkheden hand in hand gaan. Er zijn dus volop mogelijkheden om je privé- en werksituatie met elkaar te combineren.


Wij geven je de kans om te werken bij een organisatie met meerdere interessante en uitdagende werkvelden en een divers takenpakket. Binnen ons team zijn verschillende specialisaties aanwezig, waar jij als communicatiemedewerker van kunt leren en aan bij kunt dragen. Je kunt je bij ons helemaal uitleven.

Waarom goede Informatieverstrekking vanuit de RDW belangrijk is?

“Hoe mooi is het dat we overheidsorganisaties helpen hun taken goed uit te voeren? Zo dragen we bij aan een leefbaar en verkeersveilig Nederland.

Werken aan de mobiliteit van morgen  
Van de politie die informatie opvraagt over een kenteken tot een journalist die onderzoeksvragen heeft over kentekens en rijbewijzen in Nederland: als unitmanager zorg jij dat alle externe partijen op tijd de juiste informatie krijgen. Je geeft leiding aan collega’s en zet hen in hun kracht, ontwikkelt strategische plannen en realiseert afspraken en doelen volgens het managementcontract.

Daarnaast ben je teamlid van het managementteam van de afdeling, met wie je het beleid ontwikkelt en afstemt. We zijn volop bezig met de doorontwikkeling van onze afdeling. Jij helpt ons de volgende stap te zetten: je kijkt hoe we onze dienstverlening beter kunnen structureren en professionaliseren, bijvoorbeeld met de inzet van data-intelligence. Je houdt externe ontwikkelingen in de gaten, vertaalt deze naar onze afdeling en je unit en zet kansen voor innovatie om in projecten. Daarvoor werk je nauw samen met ICT-serviceteams om te zorgen dat de oplossingen onze doelen ondersteunen. Ook ben je opdrachtgever van stuurgroepen bij multidisciplinaire projecten.

Dit is jouw thuisbasis

Door je centrale rol in onze organisatie ben je vaak op kantoor te vinden, maar thuiswerken kan ook: jij voelt goed aan wanneer dat kan!

**Team Code**


Team Code houdt zich bezig met ontwerpend onderzoek. We ontwerpen nieuwe technologie en nemen publieke waarden als uitgangspunt: technologie is namelijk niet zomaar een instrument, maar kan het (samen)leven van mensen diepgaand beïnvloeden. Code kijkt hoe technologie de positie van burgers kan versterken: democratisering door middel van digitalisering. Het team bestaat uit software ontwerpers, techniek filosofen en sociale wetenschappers.

**Over Waag Futurelab**


Waag Futurelab doet al bijna 30 jaar onderzoek naar hoe technologie kan worden ingezet voor sociale innovatie. Bekende projecten van Waag zijn o.a. Fairphone, de meest duurzame smartphone ter wereld of De Digitale Stad, een van de allereerste social media platforms van Nederland. Of denk aan Operatie Sigismund, een van de eerste educatieve games in Nederland die leerlingen laat ervaren hoe spannend een archief is en nog steeds wekelijks gespeeld wordt in het Drents Archief.


 Je toekomstige collega Ouarda vertelt over werken bij Waag*: ‘De vrijheid die ik van de organisatie krijg om mijn eigen projecten in te kleuren doet mij heel erg goed. Collega’s waarderen mij, ik kan mezelf zijn en dat maakt het een fijne werkplek.’*


Waag werkt in een team van ontwerpers, kunstenaars en wetenschappers, dat publieke onderzoeksmethoden toepast op technologie en de samenleving. Daarmee stelt Waag zoveel mogelijk mensen in staat mee te ontwerpen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Dat doen we door gezamenlijk opkomende technologie te onderzoeken en onderliggende culturele aannames te bevragen en door alternatieven te ontwerpen op basis van publieke waarden. Zo proberen we bij te dragen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Op waag.org vind je meer informatie over Waag en over de projecten waaraan wij werken.


Diversiteit is cruciaal om technologie en de samenleving meer open, eerlijk en inclusief te maken. Daarom moedigen we kandidaten van diverse culturele achtergronden aan om te solliciteren. Mocht je denken niet aan alle eisen te voldoen, willen we je toch aanmoedigen om te solliciteren. Sommige kwaliteiten zijn niet in bulletpoints te vangen.

**Deadline:** 9 september 2024  

Mocht de geschikte kandidaat zich eerder melden, sluiten we de vacature eerder - dus wacht niet te lang met reageren!

 **Vacature hoofdredacteur Arbo**



Van werkstress tot machineveiligheid en van hybride werken tot gevaarlijke stoffen. Arbo is het platform dat arboprofessionals ondersteunt in hun dagelijks werk. Door ze te informeren over ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken. Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.  

  

**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.



Als hoofdredacteur Arbo ben je onderdeel van de centrale redactie van het ‘professionals portfolio’ van VMN media, waar ook PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb onderdeel van zijn. Samen zijn we een team van 14 personen.

 **Wat krijg je:**


* **Fijn team** – Leuke, betrokken collega’s die samen mooie content voor de doelgroep maken. Binnen het Arbo-team, maar ook in nauwe samenwerking binnen het professionals portfolio.
* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.



Verder nog handig om te weten: het gaat om een functie van 36 uur per week. Het kantoor van VMN media staat in Zeist.
