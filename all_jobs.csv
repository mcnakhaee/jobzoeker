Then we have an opportunity for you.

  



**Job Description**  

In the plastic packaging value chain, there is only limited information available on the plastics in that chain to assess circularity and recyclability goals, especially the use of post-consumer recyclates (PCR) in packaging.

  


Quality specifications, monitoring, and standardisation of materials are common in certain industries like chemistry and pharma but are, at this point, only in an infancy state in plastic waste management. A major challenge when it comes to mechanical recycling of plastics is that the quality of the material is not monitored throughout the whole process. Inline monitoring is however essential for predicting the final quality of PCR.

  


In the MoQuP-R project, we focus on the necessary quality monitoring tools and the application of existing models related to the prediction of recyclate quality in order to increase the use of PCR in packaging. In this project your responsibilities will entail:


* Review literature to identify potential inline analytical methods to monitor quality parameters.
* Adapt laboratory and/or offline analytical techniques to be used inline in polymer processing equipment.
* Propose and execute design changes to polymer processing equipment to enable inline measurements.
* Design experiments using polymer processing equipment and post-consumer plastics to apply and develop monitoring tools.
* Evaluate the different methods in relation to PCR quality.
* Manage a work package in the MoQuP-R project.
* Present your work at international conferences, MoQuP-R consortium meetings, and other events and write scientific papers for international peer-reviewed journals.
* Provide teaching assistance and/or supervision of researchers and students.

  




As a Postdoctoral Researcher you will work in the Circular Plastics team in the Faculty of Science and Engineering located at Brightlands Chemelot Campus in Geleen. You will become part of a young international research group, specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics with a strong polymer science background. Your will work together with Rudinei Fiorio on this exciting topic.

  


**Requirements**  

We expect you to have the following experience, knowledge, and skills:


* A PhD degree in mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, process analysis, mechatronics, or similar;
* Advanced skills in CAD and interfacing sensor data to analysis software (e.g. Python, Matlab, Simulink);
* Good knowledge on analytical techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, GCMS;
* Skills in polymer processing;
* Experience with industry collaborations is considered advantageous;
* Proficiency in both written and spoken English.

Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.
* Masters degree, PhD or equivalent experience in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, etc.).
* We prefer candidates with Deep Learning experience, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. Experience with TensorFlow is a plus.
* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).
* Excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal; the ability to convey your message to team members and other collaborators.

Then this is the perfect job for you!
  
Knab was founded in 2012. We are an online bank, but one run by real people. We are known for being different because we want to do things differently. Simpler, smarter, and more affordable for our customers. By combining smart technology with a healthy dose of common sense, we create financial services that meet your needs. We add sublime, personal service to this, creating something unique in the financial sector.  

  

**Your role and responsibilities**  

Are you passionate about problem solving and combining the use of different tools in your daily work? And are you interested in the interest rate risk and enjoy improving processes? As a Senior ALM Specialist you will be responsible for managing and modelling interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) in a small and engaged team.  

  

Furthermore, the role will include at least the following:


* Managing the interest rate risk through hedging and designing optimal risk steering;

* Shaping decision-making, policies and analyses for senior management;
* Reporting the IRRBB and FX position to ALCO;

The current interest rate environment and changes in EBA IRRBB regulation make it a very dynamic and exciting time to be part of a first-line of defence ALM team.

**The team**  

The Asset and Liability Management & Methodology (ALM&M) team’s goal is to deliver on Knab’s strategy by optimizing the balance sheet of Knab. We do this by ensuring that the interest rate risk and funding positions of Knab are managed within the boundaries set in the strategies for those risks whilst not losing sight of the profitability of the bank.  

  

We believe in assigning ownership instead of tasks and, as a result, everyone within the ALM&M team gets the chance to own and be in the lead of a focus area within our team. This creates a flat structure which enables people to take initiative and develop their professional career on their own terms.  

  

On a personal side, we are a fun and multi-national team of curious and knowledgeable people. We perceive work as a challenge to improve ourselves and the bank. We like to work together and learn from each other through regular knowledge sharing sessions. We also enjoy spending time together outside of the work (e.g. having a drink or a game of padel.  

  

**Your profile**  

To be successful in this role, this is the kind of traits we have in mind:


* Completed masters degree in (Quantitative) Finance, Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics or similar;
* 5-7 years of relevant working experience in financial modelling, ALM or balance sheet management;
* Experience with Python, R, VBA (Excel) or C++ is a must, SQL is a plus;
* Experience with ALM / risk software solutions such as QRM or Ambit Focus is preferred;
* Ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and concise way;

=====================

* **We are on a mission** to make programming biology easy. We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.
* We're an **experienced team**. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!
* We're focused on building the **best possible team culture**. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.
* We offer **top of the market** salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.


**Responsibilities**:


As a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:

* Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools
* Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations
* Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process
* Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain
* Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.
* Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem

**Need to haves**
=================

* Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills
* You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.
* You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer\*, or even implement a UI plugin.
* You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.
* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**
=================

* Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.
* A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.
* You have worked with databases or big data systems.
* You have designed user interfaces and are familiar with one or more of the popular frameworks.
* You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.
* Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Cradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.**  

  

We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.

=====================

* **We are on a mission** to make programming biology easy. We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.
* We're an **experienced team**. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!
* We're focused on building the **best possible team culture**. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.
* We offer **top of the market** salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.


**Responsibilities**:


As a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:

* Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools
* Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations
* Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process
* Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain
* Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.
* Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem

**Need to haves**
=================

* Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills
* You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.
* You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer\*, or even implement a UI plugin.
* You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.
* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**
=================

* Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.
* A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.
* You have worked with databases or big data systems.
* You have designed user interfaces and are familiar with one or more of the popular frameworks.
* You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.
* Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Cradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.**  

  

We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.


You will be joining a high-growth, highly ambitious startup with an experienced founding team, whose motivation is building a more sustainable world using biology. We are backed by some of the most well known investors and industry veterans. Joining us now means you will be getting in on the ground floor; you will have a significant impact on how we shape the company, and success will mean an outsized reward.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=0c48e3966dd23e85,indeed,Site Reliability Engineer (DevOps),Vattenfall,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Vattenfall,"Amsterdam, NH, NL",fulltime,2024-07-23,,,,,False,,,ewa.krajewska@vattenfall.com,"**Over de functie**
-------------------

 **Do you want to commit to a critical challenge and help to shape our future?**


We keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages, and configuration errors.


We are looking for a team member who is driven by technical challenges and the urge to always find better and more efficient ways of delivering services to the customer.  

  

**What will you do?**


In the role as SRE engineer you will combine the skillset of dev teams and operations teams by applying a software engineering approach to IT operations.


To succeed in this role it is important that you are self-driven, exact, analytic, critical and know how to prioritize. You are not only an expert in your field but you also have social competence and understand the business needs. You always challenge yourself and others to improve. You are also open for suggestions from others and can also give your own.


You are a team player and have a hands-on mindset, a strong customer- and problem-solving orientation. You show fast results, and you have demonstrated good communication skills, especially in an international organization. You need to be able to work independently in an international team that meets more virtually than physically.

  

  

**Your tasks and responsibilities:**

**Maintaining Applications to Help Operations and Support Teams**


As a SRE you are in charge of proactively implementing and maintaining infrastructure and business applications. This can be anything from provisioning servers, updating systems, deploying new software, providing pre-emptive maintenance to monitoring and alerting to code changes in production. A site reliability engineer can be tasked with building a homegrown tool from scratch to help with weaknesses in software delivery or incident management.


You must always be looking to improve quality and efficiency and cut costs.

**Fixing Support Escalation Issues**


Similarly to the point above, a site reliability engineer can be expected to spend time fixing support escalation cases.

**Optimizing On-Call Rotations and Processes**


More times than not, site reliability engineers will need to take on-call responsibilities and improve system reliability through the optimization of on-call processes. You will help add automation and context to alerts – leading to better real-time collaborative response from on-call responders. Additionally, you will update runbooks, tools and documentation to help prepare your on-call team members for future incidents.

**Documenting “Tribal” K****nowledge**


As you gain exposure to systems in both staging and production, as well as all technical teams, you will take part in work with software development, support, IT operations and on-call duties – meaning you will build up a great amount of historical knowledge over time. Instead of keeping this knowledge in the mind of one team or one person, as SRE you are expected to document much of what you know. Constant upkeep of documentation and runbooks can ensure teams get the information they need right when they need it.

**Conducting Post-Incident Reviews**


Without thorough post-incident reviews, you have no way to identify what’s working and what’s not. As such you will be participating in post-incident reviews, documenting your findings and taking action on your learnings.


Maybe also add \""provision new servers\""... it is attractive to have a more technical approach to woo away developers and coordinators!

 **Location**  

  

Katowice, Gliwice, Amsterdam or Solna

**Jouw profiel**
----------------

 **Who are you?**  

  

As our Site Reliability Engineer you:

* Are an expert in your field, strong technical and analytical skills, can solve impossible problems.
* Have the ability to translate complicated technical matters into simple understandable language.
* Have experience in building and operating of server virtualization environments.
* Have thorough knowledge of operating systems (Linux/Windows 2019 and up).
* Work with Agile methodology.
* Have experience in troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
* Are able to deal with tight deadlines when they arise.
* Have automation experience with at least one configuration/deployment management system (Ansible, Jenkins pipelines, Azure DevOps…).
* Have experience with at least one of the following scripting languages (Powershell, Shell, Python…).
* Have experience working with GIT.
* Have experience developing CI/CD.

  

Next to this you bring:

* Experience in a large international environment is desirable.
* Experience with containers is a plus.

**Extra informatie**

 **Our offer**  

Good remuneration, a challenging and international work environment, and the possibility to work with some of the best in the field. You will be working in interdisciplinary teams and you can always count on support from committed colleagues. We offer attractive employment conditions and opportunities for personal and professional development.

What we're certain of is this: being part of DeepL means joining a team committed to innovation and the well-being of its employees.


**Meet the team behind this journey**



We are looking for a technical lead for our DevEx function. Working with a team of around 20 people, you will be responsible for building a strong Developer Experience function within the company.

You will be working as part of the Olympus Unit which provides production and platform engineering services to the whole engineering organisation.

 **Your Responsibilities**

  

It all starts with our vision of a strong Developer Experience and enabling teams to work at their best.



You collaborate with the engineering teams across the organisation to understand their needs and come to data-driven decisions on how to improve our engineering department.

**Strategic Leadership:** Responsibilities include leading the strategic direction of the team's engagements and collaborating with stakeholders. While not directly involved in software delivery, the role necessitates a profound understanding of technical architecture, potential challenges, and aligning the team's work with broader organisational goals.

 **Qualities we look for**

* Significant experience in leading Developer Experience roles, focusing on improving DORA metrics
* Leading leaders: The team currently has two engineering managers who will report to you
* Strong engineering background, bonus points if parts of our stack are included:


* C#/.NET with ASP.NET, C++, Typescript, Python or Go

* Experience of initiating and driving large technical projects involving collaboration with multiple teams across an organisation
* 10+ years of hands-on technical experience as an engineer, including experience in large-scale organisations
* Demonstrated ability to influence and mentor teams and individuals across multiple departments or larger organisational structures
* Proactive and proficient in communicating with stakeholders in English, ensuring clear and effective interactions
* Experience with a wide range of observability practices (SLOs, Dashboards, Alerts,..) for business-critical systems

 **What we offer**

* **Diverse and internationally distributed team**: joining our team means becoming part of a large, global community with people of more than 90 nationalities. We're more than just colleagues; we're a group of professionals with a shared mission to connect diverse cultures. Our global presence is growing–we've doubled in size nearly every year, with our employees based in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the US, and Japan, and we continue to expand our network.


* **Open communication, regular feedback**: as a language-focused company, we value the importance of clear, honest communication. We value smooth collaboration, direct and actionable feedback, and believe that leading with empathy makes us better together.


* **Remote work, flexible hours**: whether you're near or in our hubs in cities like Cologne, Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Austin, or Tokyo, or prefer the comfort of your own home, you decide where your office is. We offer remote opportunities, flexible working hours and trust in your productivity, all in sync with your team's general locations and time zones to foster effective and seamless collaboration. Our aim is to integrate your work with your lifestyle, ensuring a balance that respects both your needs and our operational requirements.


* **Regular in-person team events**: we bond over vibrant events that are as unique as our team, from local team and business unit gatherings, to new-joiner onboardings and company-wide events that bring us all together–literally.


* **Monthly full-day hacking sessions**: every month, we have Hack Fridays, where you can spend your time diving into a project you're passionate about and get the opportunity to work with other teams–we value your initiatives, impact, and creativity.


* **Comprehensive health insurance**: your health comes first. With our comprehensive insurance, we'll make sure you're covered from head to toe.


* **30 days of annual leave**: we value your peace of mind. With up to 30 days off (excluding public holidays) and access to mental health resources, we make sure you're as strong mentally as you are professionally.
* **Annual learning budget**: because we never stop learning, we’ve set up an annual budget for your professional development—pick a learning path which contributes to your career development and we'll back you up.

  


**If this role and our mission resonate with you, but you're hesitant because you don't check all the boxes, don't let that hold you back. At DeepL, it's about the value you bring and the growth we can foster together. Go ahead, apply—let's discover your potential together. We can't wait to meet you!**

 ***We do it right:*** When you’re moving fast it can be tempting to constantly cut corners to things done. But this results in a product that is a struggle to work with and has unhappy users. We make that extra effort to be proud of what we’re building; understand the problem we’re solving, write one more test or tackle technical debt.

 ***We are empowered to act, challenge and lead:*** To work effectively as a team everyone must have a voice and feel they can stand up and be counted. As a software engineer at Returnista we want you to feel empowered. That could mean proposing new ideas, fixing things without seeking permission or challenging the CEO.

 ***We are intrepid:*** We want our engineers to show initiative and to innovate. Intrepid Friday’s give us the opportunity to work on things that might not ostensibly be the highest priority, but can make a big difference to our product or how we work.

As a Data Platform Engineer at MSF, you will be responsible for the Azure-based Central Data Hub (CDH).



MSF is an international, independent medical humanitarian organization. We are a non-profit, self-governed worldwide movement of more than 63,000 people.



We provide emergency medical assistance during armed conflict, natural disasters, outbreaks of deadly diseases and assist those who are excluded from healthcare.

We are an organization that remains impartial, knowledgeable, and effective, and this is what makes the difference between life and death.

* At least three years of professional research experience in relevant fields.

**What are you going to do**  

The Postdoc will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.  

The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and one Postdoc, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).

* Supervise RA’s and PhD’s working on the project;
* Draft pre-registrations and submit ethics reviews.
* Conduct data-analysis and prepare results for publications;
* Draft articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals;

Contribute to the Connected Minds Lab and the wider scientific community through collaborations, workshops, presentations/talks, attending conferences.  
* 

**What do you have to offer**  

You are a conscientious and collaborative researcher who prefers to work in a team and has an affinity with computational modeling and programming.

* 

Given that the project is multidisciplinary we cannot expect any candidate to have experience in all the necessary skills but the following are very much appreciated: experience sampling, longitudinal analyses, computational modeling, data donation and NLP (with/without generative AI).  

International candidates are encouraged to apply but must be willing to relocate to the Netherlands for the duration of the position. Due to that we will work with Dutch Youth at least part of the team needs to master the Dutch language, so proficiency in Dutch can be an advantage.

Do you want to help identify how Rabobank can increase its positive impact on nature and reduce its negative impact?

**You and your job**  

As Quantitative Analyst for Biodiversity at RaboResearch you know the secrets of modelling the impact of human activities on nature. This includes combining deep knowledge of top-down models on Nature impact with a good understanding of how bottom-up primary data can be integrated into the picture.

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=8b635dac2bd0c1f2,indeed,Data Analyst,Orbisk,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Orbisk,"Utrecht, UT, NL","parttime, fulltime",2024-07-31,,,,,True,,,,"**Our employees talk trash all day, every day.**

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



De werkzaamheden worden verricht binnen de Divisie Personeel & Organisatie Defensie (DPOD) ressorterend onder het Defensie Ondersteuningscommando (DOSCO).  

De DPOD is één van de divisies van het DOSCO. De DPOD bestaat uit zeven dienstencentra en de MD-groep.



De DPOD ondersteunt de defensieonderdelen met P&O-dienstverlening. Zij biedt daartoe kennis aan over het P&O-functiegebied en verleent diensten aan leidinggevenden, P&O-functionarissen en defensiewerknemers binnen het gehele spectrum van de personele dienstverlening. Hiermee draagt DPOD bij aan de personele gereed stelling van Defensie en het uitvoeren van goed werkgeverschap. De operationele commando’s (OPCO’s) kunnen zich hierdoor maximaal richten op de uitvoering van de primaire taakstelling van Defensie.



Je komt te werken binnen het Dienstencentrum Personeelslogistiek (DC PL) van DPOD.  

Zij verbinden mensen met banen binnen en buiten Defensie en zorgen dat de in-, door- en uitstroom van defensiepersoneel goed verloopt. Zo werken we aan personele gereedstelling, opleiding, trainingen, trajecten voor werkstudenten, maatschappelijke dientijd, en reservistenaangelegenheden. Ook zijn we hét expertisecentrum op het gebied van arbeidsmarktbemiddeling, civiel onderwijs en pre-recruitment. Zij stellen de mens centraal en vormen een brug tussen de burgermaatschappij en Defensie.

Defensie is een van de grootste werkgevers van Nederland en vertoont overeenkomsten met een groot bedrijf. De operationele commando's (zee-, land- en luchtstrijdkrachten), de Marechaussee, het DOSCO en de COMMIT lijken op werkmaatschappijen.


**Defensie Ondersteuningscommando**  

Het DOSCO is de overkoepelende dienstverlener voor de gehele Defensieorganisatie. Elk dienstencentrum heeft zijn eigen expertise. Het DOSCO streeft ernaar de klantgerichtheid te versterken, de dienstverlening te professionaliseren en de doelmatigheid te vergroten.

**Max hours per week:** 38,00  

**Apply until:** 09/15/2024  


A fully funded PhD position is available at the Department of Animal Ecology, Netherlands Institute of Ecology, in the group of Dr. Melissah Rowe. The PhD candidate will work on an ERC-funded project where the overarching aim is to determine whether reproductive microbiomes impact host fitness and evolution in wild animals and reveal the role of host genetics and immune functioning in shaping reproductive microbiome variability.  

Over the last decade we have seen a veritable explosion of work on the microbiome. This work has revealed the importance of the microbial communities in the gut, oral cavity, and skin for host biology. Indeed, microbiomes are emerging as fundamental modulators of host phenotype, fitness, and evolution. But what about microbes in the reproductive system: how does the ‘reproductive microbiome’ impact host fitness and evolution? Which microbes have the largest effects? And what factors determine whether these microbes are present? Studies of host-associated microbial communities have largely ignored the reproductive microbiome, especially in wild animals. This ERC-funded project will address these outstanding questions in order to elucidate the causes and – more importantly – the consequences of variation in reproductive microbiomes.  


**What you will be doing**
In this project, the student will use quantitative genetics to test the hypotheses that (a) variation in the microbiome is linked to individual fitness in a wild population, and (b) microbiome diversity and/or composition is heritable. The successful candidate will make use of a wild house sparrow population residing on a remote island in the Atlantic (Lundy Island), where the genetic pedigree is of high density, allowing the estimation of quantitative genetic parameters from data of a few generations.  

The PhD position will involve fieldwork on wild birds to collect samples for the characterisation of host microbiomes and quantification of reproductive success of males and females, as well as laboratory analysis, bioinformatic and statistical analysis of data, manuscript preparation, and supervision of students. There is scope for the candidate to develop complementary avenues of research that may involve additional tasks.  


**What you will be contributing**
We are looking for a highly motivated, independent, and productive person, who thrives in a collaborative and international environment and is willing to work in the field and the lab and contribute intellectually to the project. The candidate should hold a MSc degree in ecology/evolution, molecular biology, microbial ecology, or a related discipline by the time of starting the position. The candidate must have excellent communication skills, including writing and presentation of research, and must be fluent in English, as this is the working language of the group.
Experience with bird field work is highly preferred; The candidate will be expected to, after initial training, conduct fieldwork on Lundy Island for a few months every year (https://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/lundyisland/).
The candidate should also have an interest in quantitative analysis, be comfortable working with big datasets, and have some experience with R statistical software and linear mixed models.  


**What do we offer**
This PhD project will be embedded in the Rowe Group within the Department of Animal Ecology at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW), located in Wageningen, the Netherlands. The candidate will also work with the larger ERC project team, including postdocs and research assistants, based at the NIOO. The project will be in close collaboration with Dr Julia Schroeder (Julia.schroeder@imperial.ac.uk) from Imperial College London.
The student will receive training and supervision in all aspects of the work, from field work and molecular laboratory techniques, to statistical analysis and bioinformatics. We provide resources to join workshops aimed at improving specific skills e.g. bioinformatics, and for travel to conferences.
This is a temporary appointment, initially for 1 year and upon satisfaction to be prolonged for a maximum of 4 years (1.0 FTE).  


**More information**
For more information, informal enquires can be directed to Dr Melissah Rowe, m.rowe@nioo.knaw.nl. Information on the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) and the Department of Animal Ecology can be found at the website: http://www.nioo.knaw.nl/.

**De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie!**

**Wie zoeken wij?**

Voor ons hoofdkantoor in Amersfoort zoeken wij per direct een AI Solutions Developer.

In deze rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verkennen en implementeren van de mogelijkheden van generative AI, zoals ChatGPT, om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren.

Je hebt een relevante WO-opleiding afgerond of bijna afgerond, zoals Informatica of Data Science, en beschikt over aantoonbare kennis en interesse op het gebied van AI, machine learning en data-analyse. Daarnaast heb je sterke analytische vaardigheden en ben je in staat om complexe technische problemen op te lossen. Ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python, R of Java is een vereiste, evenals kennis van cloud computing en ervaring met platforms zoals AWS, Azure of Google Cloud.

Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief samen te werken in een team zijn van essentieel belang. Je bent proactief, leergierig en kunt goed omgaan met veranderingen en uitdagingen. Daarnaast heb je een sterke drive om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en ICT-management.

**Wat ga je doen?**

Deze functie is nieuw binnen Lab21, wat betekent dat je een grote invloed hebt op de invulling ervan. Je zult een onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren. Als Junior ICT Manager speel je een belangrijke rol bij het implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen binnen ons bedrijf. Je werkt nauw samen met verschillende teams om de behoeften van de organisatie in kaart te brengen en technologische oplossingen aan te dragen. Je analyseert en optimaliseert bestaande systemen en processen en identificeert kansen om AI-technologieën toe te passen.

**Plaats in de organisatie:**

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

**Duration of agreement:** 5 months  

**Apply until:** 11 August 2024  


**What will you be doing?**
Historically-collected, long-term datasets are some of the most valuable assets in ecology and environmental science. Their preservation is of paramount importance, especially in light of ongoing environmental change. Yet many such datasets remain effectively inaccessible because they are not publicly shared or, more concerningly, only exist in non-digital or obsolete formats. The urgency of these issues increases with the age of the data. Indeed, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and Open data biodiversity data from prior to the mid-20th century or exceedingly rare.; further reason to preserve those data that do exist.  


This position forms part of the *NESKAST 1.0* project, with funding provided by the Netherlands Biodiversity Information Facility (NLBIF). In this project, we seek to apply best practices in data management to digitise and FAIRify historical (1922 - 1950) data on the breeding ecology of hole-nesting birds, which are currently stored as paper ledgers in the archives of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW). The data, spanning a nearly 30-year time period in the early professionalisation of ecology and biodiversity monitoring, were rigorously collected and stored by amateur naturalists. The data are especially valuable given their duration and coverage of a time period that is not well-represented by existing long-term studies.In particular, these data, in combination with those from the long-term nest box studies conducted by NIOO-KNAW and its predecessors since 1955, will extend our ability to understand how recent environmental change is impacting the ecology and population persistence of wild birds.  


In this short-term position, the prospective applicant will focus on three primary tasks:
* Digitisation of the historical nest box data — automated data extraction, manual data entry and cross-checking


* FAIRification of the data — generate metadata, apply standard data vocabularies, and map tabular data


* Prepare outreach materials — summarise project results for presentation to NESTKAST 2.0 community
  


**What will you be contributing?**
As part of a team working on data rescue and FAIRification, you will apply your knowledge and skills to digitise and archive the historical data described above. You will develop and implement a script for automated data extraction using script-based approaches in R (or other relevant languages), wrangling the extracted data into tidy, tabular data frames, and evaluating and correcting errors in the compiled datasets. Subsequent work will include the extraction of relevant metadata from the legders, creation of a data dictionary, and application of common data standards to ensure the data meeting FAIR practices. This work will be carried out in close collaboration with team members well-versed in these standards and their application to ecological data, and researchers actively collecting similar data from our long-term studies. You will be involved in preparing a summary presentation on the outcomes of this initiative.  


**Desired qualifications, skills and competences:**
* Basic experience with script-based data wrangling, standarisation, and visualisation, with a preference for the R programming language
* Experience with or knowledge of automated processes for extraction of tabular data from PDF scans of hand-written documents
* Experience with data validation, including assertative programming techniques
* Basic knowledge of or strong interest in data standards and metadata schema relevant in ecology and related disciplines (e.g., DarwinCore, Ecological Metadata Language)
* Strong interest in Open and FAIR research practices, and transparent and reproducible science
* Profiency in English, both written and verbal

  


**What are we offering?**
This technical/research support position will be hosted in the Department of Animal Ecology at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) in Wageningen. The work will be carried out in collaboration with research personnel in the Department spearheading efforts in data rescue and FAIRification, and will link closely with the LTER-LIFE large-scale infrastructure project hosted at the Institute. The employee will work in a vibrant research group and have the opportunity to create strong links with collaborators and partners involved in national Open and FAIR Science initiatives.

De Koninklijke Marechaussee zit zich in voor o.a. de grenspolitietaak, het bewaken en beveiligen van objecten en personen, en de internationale en militaire politietaak. Voor de uitvoering van deze taken is het van belang om een zo gedegen mogelijk beeld te hebben. Door informatie op verschillende internetplatformen en sociale media te zoeken en met elkaar in verband te brengen speel jij als OSINT-analist hierin een belangrijke rol. De online wereld is jouw specialisme. Jij onderkent, verzamelt, interpreteert en analyseert relevante informatie uit publiek toegankelijke bronnen. Dit doe je op basis van een inlichtingenbehoefte en je verliest hierbij de juridische kaders niet uit het oog.  

Als OSINT-analist draag je bij aan bredere intelligencebeelden op trend- en fenomeenniveau en onderzoeken op specifieke thema’s. Je zoekt hierin de samenwerking met mede OSINT-specialisten maar ook met collega’s die vanuit een andere bron of invalshoek bij het onderzoek betrokken zijn. Daarnaast werk je samen met partners van buiten de Koninklijke Marechaussee, waaronder de politie en het OM. Als OSINT-specialist ben jij dus onderdeel van een breed netwerk van collega’s!  

Wij zoeken een scherpe en analytische collega die de juiste informatie weet te vinden en alert is op patronen. Je bent is staat om verbanden te leggen en uit grote hoeveelheden informatie snel en adequaat de juiste informatie te destilleren. Dit doe je o.a. door het gebruik van query’s en data-technieken. Je bent kritisch en goed op de hoogte van de juridische en ethische grenzen van het OSINT werk. Enerzijds vind je het prettig om in een team te werken en in gezamenlijkheid een onderzoek uit te voeren. Anderzijds houd je van pionieren en kun je goed zelfstandig werken. Het OSINT vakgebied is bij ons volop in ontwikkeling dus dat vraagt een grote mate van zelfstandigheid en het om kunnen gaan met vernieuwing.

### **Wie zoeken we**

* Je bent in het bezit van een afgeronde HBO en/of bij voorkeur een afgeronde WO-opleiding. Liefst op gebied van criminologie, veiligheidsstudies, conflictstudies of geschiedenis, maar we staan ook open voor een andere relevante studierichting.
* Je hebt ervaring met of in ieder geval interesse in open-bronnen onderzoek/internetonderzoek.
* Je hebt bij voorkeur analyse-ervaring opgedaan in een vorige functie.
* Je bent zowel een teamspeler als zelfstandig.

### **De organisatie Ministerie van Defensie**


Defensie zet zich in voor de belangen, welvaart en vrijheid van Nederland. We zijn dagelijks actief in binnen- en buitenland. Onze wereldwijde inzet versterkt de internationale samenwerking en zorgt ervoor dat mensen zich in vrijheid kunnen ontplooien. Nu en in de toekomst.



Bij het ministerie van Defensie werken ongeveer 56.000 mensen direct en indirect aan vrede en veiligheid. Het ministerie bestaat uit de Bestuursstaf (het departement), de Koninklijke Marine, de Koninklijke Landmacht, de Koninklijke Luchtmacht, de Koninklijke Marechaussee, het Defensie Ondersteuningscommando (DOSCO) en de Defensie Materieel Organisatie (DMO).



Defensie is een van de grootste werkgevers van Nederland en vertoont overeenkomsten met een groot bedrijf. De operationele commando's (zee-, land- en luchtstrijdkrachten), de Marechaussee, het DOSCO en de DMO lijken op werkmaatschappijen.



Voor Defensie is het helder: gelijke kansen voor iedereen en een open organisatie waar mensen zich prettig en veilig voelen. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat we met een inclusieve organisatie onze taak, Beschermen wat ons dierbaar is, het beste kunnen uitvoeren en voorbereid zijn op ontwikkelingen in maatschappij en de wereld. Als het gaat om de afkomst, geloofsovertuiging, sekse of gender van onze militairen en burgermedewerkers willen we zoveel mogelijk een afspiegeling zijn van ons veelzijdige land.



De Koninklijke Marechaussee is een gendarmeriekorps: een politiekorps met militaire status. De medewerkers zijn zowel militair als politieman of -vrouw. De Marechaussee is in Nederland en wereldwijd inzetbaar voor veiligheid, juist als het erop aankomt. Zij wordt ingezet op plaatsen van strategisch belang. Van luchthavens tot paleizen in Nederland. Van de buitengrenzen van Europa tot oorlogs- en crisisgebieden. Ook treedt de marechaussee op als politie voor Defensie.

### **De afdeling KMAR/LTC/INTELL/A&O**


De werkzaamheden worden verricht binnen het Landelijk Tactisch Commando (LTC) van de Koninklijke Marechaussee. Het LTC heeft tot doel op tactisch niveau uitvoering te geven aan de grenspolitietaak, bewaken & beveiligen en internationale en militaire politietaken. Specifiek worden de werkzaamheden verricht binnen de afdeling Intelligence. Deze afdeling heeft tot doel een actueel intelligencebeeld te leveren in de verschillende planfases ten behoeve van het maken van strategische, tactische en operationele keuzes.

* You will play a central role within ING and your activities will impact ING's overall P&L. Your success will depend on your ability to maintain good relations with our stakeholders, i.e. CRO NL divisions, Finance, the Business Tribes, Group Financial Risk, Model Validation, Group Treasury and also our external stakeholders ECB, DNB and the external auditor of ING.

* An academic degree (MSc or PhD), preferably in Econometrics or other quantitative studies such as Mathematics, Engineering & Physics
* Finished additional professional qualifications in the financial risk field such as CFA, FRM, or the willingness to do so
* Minimum of 7 to 10 years of relevant experience in the financial sector (e.g. banking, insurance, consulting)

**De afdeling -** ***Corporate Dienst Datafundamenten en Analytics***  

De Corporate Dienst Datafundamenten en Analytics (DF&A) werkt voor directies van de Belastingdienst die belast zijn met de fiscale behandeling van burgers en bedrijven én voor bedrijfsvoering. DF&A levert signaalmodellen en informatiedashboards die zijn gebaseerd op de analyse van ‘big data’ en die de organisatie inzicht geven in de mogelijkheden om werkzaamheden slimmer en beter uit te voeren. Zo kunnen op informatie-gestuurde wijze keuzes worden gemaakt in bijvoorbeeld handhavingsstrategieën, behandeladviezen en procesinrichtingen.  

De signaalmodellen en dashboards worden gebouwd door gebruik te maken van innovatieve IT-ontwikkelingen en het koppelen van zeer divers aangeleverde data. DF&A maakt hiervoor gebruik van een zelfontwikkelde methodiek om data op te bouwen tot datafundamenten, die de basis zijn voor de producten.

Dit biedt een unieke combinatie die snel veel kennis en ervaring oplevert en een sterke positie in de markt mogelijk maakt. De aanwezigheid van ervaren collega’s stimuleert jouw ontwikkeling, net als de complexiteit en uitdagingen tijdens opdrachten. Dagelijks sta je voor complexe puzzels en geniet je van de variatie en uitdaging die de opdrachten bieden, waardoor je voortdurend wordt uitgedaagd en gemotiveerd.

Als BI Consultant analyseer je in eerste instantie de informatiebehoefte van de klant en ontwikkel je rapporten en dashboards. Je kunt je specialiseren in het maken van managementinformatie voor diverse bronapplicaties of nieuwe technieken toepassen. Verder kun je je verdiepen in datawarehousing als BI data engineer, een BI-architectuur ontwikkelen als data architect of voorspellingsmodellen maken als data scientist. Ten slotte kun je een adviserende rol aannemen om klanten te helpen bij het bepalen van hun managementinformatiebehoeften.

**Wat je gaat doen**

Er zijn vijf hoofdrollen binnen BI, hoewel titels kunnen variëren. Vaak overlappen deze rollen, wat betekent dat je tijdens een opdracht elementen van meerdere rollen kunt tegenkomen.

In de basis vraag je bij de klant de behoefte naar managementinformatie uit en vertaal je deze naar een rapport of dashboard. Als BI Consultant richt je je op het ontwikkelen van het rapport of dashboard met de beschikbare BI-tool, terwijl je als Data Engineer meer bezig bent met de techniek achter het beschikbaar stellen van de data (en meestal) in de vorm van een datawarehouse.

**Jouw verantwoordelijkheden**

* Je analyseert de informatiebehoefte en data;
* Je ontwikkelt rapporten en dashboards;
* Je ontwikkelt een datawarehouse en bijbehorende ETL-processen;
* Je vertaalt klantvraagstukken naar passende en toekomstbestendige BI-architectuur;
* Je komt tot resultaten waarmee de opdrachtgever echt blij is;
* Je adviseert over het gebruik van managementinformatie.

**Waar wij voor staan**

Bij Solviteers werk je samen met een team van deskundige collega's om complexe IT-vraagstukken aan te pakken. Jouw bijdrage gaat verder dan waarde leveren aan klanten; het draagt direct bij aan positieve maatschappelijke impact. Binnen Solviteers staat professionele groei centraal, maar ook het plezier in samenwerken. Zo kan je naast goed samenwerken met professionals, ook op vrijwillige basis aansluiten bij leuke uitjes die georganiseerd worden door onze personeelsvereniging.

**Jouw ontwikkeling**

Bij Solviteers zijn we ervan overtuigd dat je kunt blijven groeien. In onze op maat gemaakte ontwikkeltrajecten focus je op zowel persoonlijke- als professionele groei. Met specifieke ontwikkelpaden voor elke functie, afgestemd op jouw sterke punten en ambities. Wij bieden trajecten aan waarin je werkt aan het versterken van hard skills, soft skills en praktijkervaring. Bij ons staat jouw groei centraal.

***Wat breng je mee?***

Om succesvol te zijn in deze rol is het belangrijk dat je analytische vaardigheden bezit en creatief bent in het bedenken van oplossingen. Jouw communicatieve vaardigheden en resultaatgerichtheid zorgen er daarnaast voor je dat je nieuwe concepten snel kunt oppakken, goed met stakeholders kan schakelen en flexibel bent in veranderende omstandigheden.

**Wat je verder meeneemt:**

* Je hebt een hbo-/wo diploma, bij voorkeur op het gebied van BI of ICT;
* Je hebt ervaring met BI-tools (Cognos of Power-BI);
* Je hebt ervaring met SQL (Oracle of SQL-server);
* Je hebt ervaring met methodieken zoals Scrum en Agile en hebt affiniteit met het inzichtelijk maken van data.

* Je hebt bij voorkeur kennis van datawarehouse concepten en architecturen zoals Stermodelleren, Kimball en/of Data Vault;
* Je hebt bij voorkeur ervaring met het ontwikkelen van datawarehouses (Oracle of Azure);

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)
* Python en SQL

**Fijne pre's:**

* Kennis van jaarrekeningcontrole

----------------


Are you a bachelor student within a technical study, such as Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, and are you looking for an apprentice internship? Do you enjoy programming? Are you skilled in MATLAB or Python? Would you like to apply your theoretical knowledge in a real world setting and gain some practical experience? Then this internship might be interesting to you!

**Background information**
--------------------------


The Metrology Leveling department is part of the Development and Engineering sector of ASML. Our primary focus is on measuring each silicon wafer prior to exposure inside the Twinscan, generating a surface map with nanometer precision. In addition, we also play a role in the calibration of the Twinscan itself and maintain the control of the ""measure sequence"", which includes both our measurements and those from other departments, such as Horizontal Alignment. Stage alignment (SA) is the functionality that is used to determine the position (and shape) of plates of the wafer stage with respect to the metro frame. These plates are used as a reference for other measurements - both on measure and on expose side. Which plate or plates are measured, on which plate reticle alignment is done and the type of measure sequence (Production, Robust, etc.) differs per platform.

**Your assignment**
-------------------


With the introduction of a new Stage Alignment sequence in software, we also need to update the diagnostics tool used to analyze and visualize data from the machine. One of the biggest diagnostics tools, FlatNG, needs to be updated to handle the analysis and visualization of data from this new sequence. This will allow customers to help troubleshoot their systems themselves or with the help of the local office. Therefore, this assignment consists of adding this new functionality to the diagnostics tool. Additionally, some other tasks may include fixing bugs in the tool or even attempting to link the measure sequence and stage alignment sequence tooling dashboards.

**Your profile**
----------------


To be a match for this internship, you:

* Are busy with your bachelor's in Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, or in a related technical study;
* Are skilled in MATLAB and/or Python;
* Are solution oriented and have a hands-on mentality;
* Have logical reasoning and a proactive mindset;
* Have good communication skills in English (verbal and written).


This is an apprentice internship for 4-5 days a week (3 days onsite) with a duration of 3 to 6 months. The start date is as soon as possible, October 2024.

**Please note that we can only consider students who are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship.**

**Leading with purpose**
------------------------

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

***Met 24 merken binnen VMN media brengen we nieuws, achtergronden en data*** *binnen verschillende branches, zoals bouw, vastgoed, horeca en supermarkten.* ***1,5 miljoen professionals in Nederland gebruiken onze content*** *om betere beslissingen te maken in hun werk en hun organisatie en bedrijfstak vooruit te helpen.* ***Want kennis is de drijfveer van vooruitgang.***


**De rol in hoofdlijnen**  

Je gaat werken als journalist/redacteur voor **Assurantie Magazine (AM),** het grootste onafhankelijke nieuwsplatform voor financieel dienstverleners. Van verzekeraar tot hypotheekverstrekker en van schadebehandelaar tot pensioenadviseur; AM is al ruim 40 jaar de go-to nieuwsbron voor de verzekeringsbranche. Het is een competitieve, dynamische wereld vol botsende belangen, maar ook een branche met talloze mooie innovaties en maatschappelijke uitdagingen, zoals: hoe verzekeren we de energietransitie, en de steeds grotere cybercrime dreiging?


In deze rol:


* Draag jij met je spraakmakende, diepgravende artikelen en scoops bij aan structurele groei van het aantal betalende abonnees.
* Werk je voor AMweb.nl, waarmee je focus op digitale media ligt en je mede op basis van data je vervolgstappen bepaalt.
* Ben je binnen de redactie owner van je eigen dossiers die vallen onder belangrijke thema’s voor de verzekeringsbranche.
* Ben je als journalist actief betrokken bij de sector. Je kent onze doelgroep door en door, en je onderhoudt je netwerk goed.


**Het team**  

We zijn een divers team van ervaren redacteuren, werkstudenten, event organisatoren en sales collega’s. De redactie van vijf redacteuren werkt aan eigen dossiers binnen thema’s zoals Schade, Hypotheken en het Intermediair, maar is ook nauw betrokken bij de AM Top 100 en ons jaarlijkse grote event voor de branche: AMdag.



Onze redactie ontmoet elkaar een vaste dag per week op kantoor, dan hebben we met elkaar ook de wekelijkse inhoudelijke redactievergadering, en daarnaast spreken we flexibel af en werken we samen via Teams.  



  

  

**Wat breng jij mee?**


* Je hebt journalistieke ervaring, en een portfolio van artikelen en verhalen waar je trots op bent.
* Je bent nieuwsgierig, onderzoekend en kritisch en verdiept je graag in de hete hangijzers en trends binnen de branche.
* Je houdt van de afwisseling die werken op een redactie meebrengt, je vindt het leuk mee te denken over en te schakelen tussen het schrijven van nieuwsberichten en scoops enerzijds en inhoudelijke artikelen die diepgravend onderzoek vragen anderzijds.
* Je hebt kennis van de financiële dienstverlening, of bovengemiddelde interesse en de wil om snel alles te weten te komen over onze doelgroep.


**Ons aanbod**


* Bij VMN kom je om te leren, de ruimte om je journalistieke ideeën te realiseren, en voor de goede werk/privé balans. Wij werken hybride en je hebt veel vrijheid om je eigen werkweek in te delen.
* Wij organiseren veel sociale en inhoudelijke bijeenkomsten, waar je ook de andere VMN collega’s ontmoet, zo kun je leren van en ervaringen uitwisselen met andere journalisten/redacteuren en externe sprekers of trainers. Hoogwaardige journalistiek is de kern van onze organisatie: hierin investeren vinden we belangrijk.
* Een diverse en inclusieve werkomgeving, waar iedereen welkom is en waar we voortdurend werken aan het verhogen van ieders werkgeluk.
* Natuurlijk krijg je ook een goed salaris, een keuzebudget van 12%, een goed pensioen, 20 vakantiedagen per jaar op basis van 36 uur per week en de mogelijkheid om tot 3 weken extra vakantie bij te kopen vanuit je keuzebudget, een laptop en telefoon, reiskostenvergoeding (km) of OV Business Card.

Doe met ons mee en maak impact als onze nieuwe communicatiemedewerker!""*

 **Vacature**

**Communicatiemedewerker GGD** **(24 uur)**

 **Hoe ziet jouw toekomstige werkdag eruit?**  

Je start de werkdag goed met een lekkere kop koffie. Samen met je collega’s praat je bij over het weekend. Maar niet te lang, want aan het begin van de ochtend heb je meteen de weekstart van de GGD. Samen met je communicatiecollega’s bespreek je welke gezondheidsonderwerpen je de komende periode uitlicht. Dit doe je aan de hand van de omgevingsscan waarop je aanhaakt bij de behoefte van de inwoners, de contentplanning en ons jaarplan.


Hierna ga je gelijk aan de slag met het maken van content. De nieuwe social mediacampagne moet namelijk vandaag worden ingepland. Jij weet als geen ander hoe je met creatieve content de doelgroep kan bereiken. Naast je eigen kennis en ervaring, gebruik je hierbij de data en resultaten van eerdere, gelijksoortige campagnes.


De tijd vliegt en voor je het weet is het lunchtijd. Je loopt een rondje met je collega’s om even de benen te strekken. Als je terugkomt start een online meeting met een projectleider over een nieuwe voorlichtingscampagne. Je stelt vragen over doel, doelgroep en adviseert vervolgens over middelen.


Na de meeting neem je de tijd om je mail bij te werken. Je ontving een vraag van een journalist. Samen met de inhoudsdeskundige die de woordvoering doet, formuleer je de antwoorden op de vragen. Later deze week begeleid je het persmoment. Het laatste uur voer je een maandelijkse analyse uit om het gebruikersgedrag op de websites in beeld te brengen. Dit geeft weer nieuwe inzichten om de website te optimaliseren. Voldaan klap je je laptop dicht en verheug je je op morgen. Want morgen is weer een nieuwe dag die totaal anders kan zijn!

**Wat ga je doen?**  

Binnen onze veiligheidsregio hebben we de unieke combinatie van gezondheid (GGD) én veiligheid (Brandweer, Crisisbeheersing). Als communicatiemedewerker richt jij je op operationele taken van de GGD. Jouw werkgebied is breed en omvat afgebakende, uitvoerende werkzaamheden waarbij je nauw samenwerkt en spart met je communicatiecollega's.


Daarnaast zijn we een crisisorganisatie, wat betekent dat je ook bereid bent deel te nemen aan een communicatiepiket tijdens crisissituaties. Gemiddeld ben je 8 tot 10 keer per jaar een week lang bereikbaar en beschikbaar voor communicatieve werkzaamheden tijdens crisissituaties. Dit doe je samen met andere collega's die piket hebben die week.

**Jouw taken:**

* Content creatie: realiseren van boeiend en inspirerende content voor onze online en offline kanalen.
* Verhalen vertellen: complexe info omzetten in begrijpelijke en pakkende verhalen die onze doelgroep raken en betrekken.
* Social media: beheren van social media kanalen, toffe posts maken en interactie aangaan met onze volgers.
* Content organiseren: campagnes plannen en coördineren die ons merk en werk in de spotlight zetten.
* Huisstijl bewaken: bewaken en versterken van onze huisstijl in alle communicatie-uitingen
* Media contacten: opbouwen en onderhouden van relaties met de media, en zorgen voor positieve publiciteit en zichtbaarheid.
* Data checken: communicatiekanalen en communicatiecampagnes analyseren en data gebruiken om onze strategieën te verbeteren.
* Samenwerken: met verschillende teams en vormgever om communicatieprojecten van start tot finish te brengen.

**Wat breng je mee?**

* Diploma in communicatie of een vergelijkbare studie.
* Ervaring met traditionele en moderne communicatiemiddelen en campagnes.
* Top skills voor het maken pakkende teksten en beelden waarmee je onze doelgroep raakt.
* Sterk in vormgeving en bekend met tools, zoals Canva.
* Creatief brein met scherp oog voor detail.
* Sterke verbale en schriftelijke communicatie.
* Zelfstarter met een proactieve mindset.
* Analytisch vermogen om social media en websitedata om te zetten in slimme(re) communicatie.
* Echte teamplayer die graag samenwerkt.
* Passie voor verhalen vertellen en het bouwen van een sterk merk.
* Coachende vaardigheden en het vermogen om collega's te begeleiden en afdelingen te ondersteunen bij hun communicatie.

**Jouw team:**  

Je werkt in een leuk en enthousiast communicatieteam met 12 collega’s. Een team dat grotendeels bestaat uit jonge professionals, maar ook met enkele collega’s die al langer in het vak zitten. We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**  

Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA. Je komt te werken in een crisisorganisatie vol afwisseling. De coronacrisis, vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne, het hoogwater van de Maas of een grote brand. Wij waren erbij betrokken. Als communicatiemedewerker zit je bij ons nooit stil.


Je kunt je eigen werktijden en werkplek bepalen. Wij werken vanuit vertrouwen waarbij vrijheden en verantwoordelijkheden hand in hand gaan. Er zijn dus volop mogelijkheden om je privé- en werksituatie met elkaar te combineren.


Wij geven je de kans om te werken bij een organisatie met meerdere interessante en uitdagende werkvelden en een divers takenpakket. Binnen ons team zijn verschillende specialisaties aanwezig, waar jij als communicatiemedewerker van kunt leren en aan bij kunt dragen. Je kunt je bij ons helemaal uitleven. Bij ons ben je in goede handen.

**Je krijgt ook:**

* Een aanstelling voor een jaar voor 24 uur per week, met uitzicht op een vaste aanstelling;
* De mogelijkheid om hybride te werken inclusief bijhorende thuiswerkvergoeding;
* Een bruto maandsalaris tussen € 3.010 en € 4.302 (schaal 8) bij een fulltime dienstverband van 36 uur, afhankelijk van ervaring;
* Mogelijkheden om jezelf te ontwikkelen via trainingen, cursussen en opleidingen;
* Alle faciliteiten om goed te kunnen werken, zoals een laptop en een telefoon;
* Een Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB). Het IKB is 18,63% van je brutoloon. Je kunt het IKB maandelijks naar eigen behoefte inzetten. Hiermee kun je korting krijgen bij een sportschool, een fiets aanschaffen of een extra opleiding volgen. Maar je mag het ook uit laten betalen of er extra vakantiedagen mee kopen

**Communicatiemedewerker GGD (24 uur)**  

  

**Hoe ziet jouw toekomstige werkdag eruit?**  

Je start de werkdag goed met een lekkere kop koffie. Samen met je collega’s praat je bij over het weekend. Maar niet te lang, want aan het begin van de ochtend heb je meteen de weekstart van de GGD. Samen met je communicatiecollega’s bespreek je welke gezondheidsonderwerpen je de komende periode uitlicht. Dit doe je aan de hand van de omgevingsscan waarop je aanhaakt bij de behoefte van de inwoners, de contentplanning en ons jaarplan.
  

  

Hierna ga je gelijk aan de slag met het maken van content. De nieuwe social mediacampagne moet namelijk vandaag worden ingepland. Jij weet als geen ander hoe je met creatieve content de doelgroep kan bereiken. Naast je eigen kennis en ervaring, gebruik je hierbij de data en resultaten van eerdere, gelijksoortige campagnes.
  

  

De tijd vliegt en voor je het weet is het lunchtijd. Je loopt een rondje met je collega’s om even de benen te strekken. Als je terugkomt start een online meeting met een projectleider over een nieuwe voorlichtingscampagne. Je stelt vragen over doel, doelgroep en adviseert vervolgens over middelen.
  

  

Na de meeting neem je de tijd om je mail bij te werken. Je ontving een vraag van een journalist . Samen met de inhoudsdeskundige die de woordvoering doet, formuleer je de antwoorden op de vragen. Later deze week begeleid je het persmoment. Het laatste uur voer je een maandelijkse analyse uit om het gebruikersgedrag op de websites in beeld te brengen. Dit geeft weer nieuwe inzichten om de website te optimaliseren. Voldaan klap je je laptop dicht en verheug je je op morgen. Want morgen is weer een nieuwe dag die totaal anders kan zijn!
  

  

**Wat ga je doen?**  

Binnen onze veiligheidsregio hebben we de unieke combinatie van gezondheid (GGD) én veiligheid (Brandweer, Crisisbeheersing). Als communicatiemedewerker richt jij je op operationele taken van de GGD. Jouw werkgebied is breed en omvat afgebakende, uitvoerende werkzaamheden waarbij je nauw samenwerkt en spart met je communicatiecollega's.
  

  

Daarnaast zijn we een crisisorganisatie, wat betekent dat je ook bereid bent deel te nemen aan een communicatiepiket tijdens crisissituaties. Gemiddeld ben je 8 tot 10 keer per jaar een week lang bereikbaar en beschikbaar voor communicatieve werkzaamheden tijdens crisissituaties. Dit doe je samen met andere collega's die piket hebben die week.
  

  

**Jouw taken:**

* Data checken: communicatiekanalen en communicatiecampagnes analyseren en data gebruiken om onze strategieën te verbeteren.

**Wat breng je mee?**  

* Diploma in communicatie of een vergelijkbare studie.
* Ervaring met traditionele en moderne communicatiemiddelen en campagnes.
* Top skills voor het maken pakkende teksten en beelden waarmee je onze doelgroep raakt.

* Creatief brein met scherp oog voor detail.
* Sterke verbale en schriftelijke communicatie.
* Zelfstarter met een proactieve mindset.
* Analytisch vermogen om social media en websitedata om te zetten in slimme(re) communicatie.
* Echte teamplayer die graag samenwerkt.
* Passie voor verhalen vertellen en het bouwen van een sterk merk.
* Coachende vaardigheden en het vermogen om collega's te begeleiden en afdelingen te ondersteunen bij hun communicatie.

  

**Jouw team:**  

Je werkt in een leuk en enthousiast communicatieteam met 12 collega’s. Een team dat grotendeels bestaat uit jonge professionals, maar ook met enkele collega’s die al langer in het vak zitten. We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.
  

  

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA. Je komt te werken in een crisisorganisatie vol afwisseling. De coronacrisis, vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne, het hoogwater van de Maas of een grote brand. Wij waren erbij betrokken. Als communicatiemedewerker zit je bij ons nooit stil.
  

  

Je kunt je eigen werktijden en werkplek bepalen. Wij werken vanuit vertrouwen waarbij vrijheden en verantwoordelijkheden hand in hand gaan. Er zijn dus volop mogelijkheden om je privé- en werksituatie met elkaar te combineren.
  

  

Wij geven je de kans om te werken bij een organisatie met meerdere interessante en uitdagende werkvelden en een divers takenpakket.

**Functieomschrijving**  

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van het AD in Rotterdam. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data.

De adviezen geef je op drie ‘snelheden’: live, in dag- en weekrapporten en in losse analyses. Op de dag zelf kijk je met een schuin oog mee naar de cijfers en deel je belangrijke actiegerichte inzichten met de redactie. In dag- en weekrapporten geef je duiding aan de cijfers. Naast de dagelijkse taken voer je ook regelmatig diepgravende analyses uit.

  


Je bent een belangrijke sparringpartner voor de chefs en hoofdredactie bij AD en werkt nauw met hen samen.

We werken aan creatieve oplossingen voor complexe vraagstukken. Dat lukt alleen met een fijne werksfeer en met goed teamwork. Naast redactie-analisten zijn er diverse centrale rollen in het team die jou bij je werk zullen ondersteunen.  

  

**Functieprofiel**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.


**VOORWAARDEN**


* salaris, passend bij jouw ervaring;
* 38-urige werkweek, minder uur in overleg;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;
* ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden d.m.v. opleidingen en trainingen;
* We geloven in een gezonde werk-privébalans waarbij je voldoende ruimte krijgt voor jouw welzijn en flexibel werken.

**Who Are We - About Job Squad‍️**
----------------------------------


Job Squad was founded by a couple of young Danish entrepreneurs with a passion for recruitment and HR. One has years of experience in corporate recruitment, the other is a startup obsessed with more than 4 of these young businesses to his name. Both of these young mavericks came together with their shared experiences to create Job Squad, a personal recruitment agency with a corporate twist. Job Squad’s vision was to create career opportunities for Europeans across borders, that will strengthen and develop their personality and career diversity. By breaking down borders and bringing on a wide variety of clients and positions we try to make sure there’s a position and dream destination for everyone.


At Job Squad we like to think of ourselves as professionals without the formality - after all, we are here to help and make sure both job hunt and relocation are as seamless and supportive as possible. Furthermore, we are a big multinational team, living and working in many different countries, but working closely both in and between teams! An internship at Job Squad means that you will become an essential part of the team, and you will have tasks and responsibilities and we expect you to be proactive.

**Team Code**


Team Code houdt zich bezig met ontwerpend onderzoek. We ontwerpen nieuwe technologie en nemen publieke waarden als uitgangspunt: technologie is namelijk niet zomaar een instrument, maar kan het (samen)leven van mensen diepgaand beïnvloeden. Code kijkt hoe technologie de positie van burgers kan versterken: democratisering door middel van digitalisering. Het team bestaat uit software ontwerpers, techniek filosofen en sociale wetenschappers.

**Over Waag Futurelab**


Waag Futurelab doet al bijna 30 jaar onderzoek naar hoe technologie kan worden ingezet voor sociale innovatie. Bekende projecten van Waag zijn o.a. Fairphone, de meest duurzame smartphone ter wereld of De Digitale Stad, een van de allereerste social media platforms van Nederland. Of denk aan Operatie Sigismund, een van de eerste educatieve games in Nederland die leerlingen laat ervaren hoe spannend een archief is en nog steeds wekelijks gespeeld wordt in het Drents Archief.


 Je toekomstige collega Ouarda vertelt over werken bij Waag*: ‘De vrijheid die ik van de organisatie krijg om mijn eigen projecten in te kleuren doet mij heel erg goed. Collega’s waarderen mij, ik kan mezelf zijn en dat maakt het een fijne werkplek.’*


Waag werkt in een team van ontwerpers, kunstenaars en wetenschappers, dat publieke onderzoeksmethoden toepast op technologie en de samenleving. Daarmee stelt Waag zoveel mogelijk mensen in staat mee te ontwerpen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Dat doen we door gezamenlijk opkomende technologie te onderzoeken en onderliggende culturele aannames te bevragen en door alternatieven te ontwerpen op basis van publieke waarden. Zo proberen we bij te dragen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Op waag.org vind je meer informatie over Waag en over de projecten waaraan wij werken.


Diversiteit is cruciaal om technologie en de samenleving meer open, eerlijk en inclusief te maken. Daarom moedigen we kandidaten van diverse culturele achtergronden aan om te solliciteren. Mocht je denken niet aan alle eisen te voldoen, willen we je toch aanmoedigen om te solliciteren. Sommige kwaliteiten zijn niet in bulletpoints te vangen.

**Deadline:** 9 september 2024  

Mocht de geschikte kandidaat zich eerder melden, sluiten we de vacature eerder - dus wacht niet te lang met reageren!


Voor vragen over de vacature kan je contact opnemen met Simone van der Burg (Hoofd afdeling Code) of Tamar ter Steege (interim Hoofd Communicatie) via telefoonnummer: 020 5579898 of e-mail: simone@waag.org / tamar@waag.org

***Met 24 merken binnen VMN media brengen we nieuws, achtergronden en data*** *binnen verschillende branches, zoals bouw, vastgoed, horeca en supermarkten.* ***1,5 miljoen professionals in Nederland gebruiken onze content*** *om betere beslissingen te maken in hun werk en hun organisatie en bedrijfstak vooruit te helpen.* ***Want kennis is de drijfveer van vooruitgang.***

 **Vacature hoofdredacteur Arbo**



Van werkstress tot machineveiligheid en van hybride werken tot gevaarlijke stoffen. Arbo is het platform dat arboprofessionals ondersteunt in hun dagelijks werk. Door ze te informeren over ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken. Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.  

  

**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.



Als hoofdredacteur Arbo ben je onderdeel van de centrale redactie van het ‘professionals portfolio’ van VMN media, waar ook PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb onderdeel van zijn. Samen zijn we een team van 14 personen.

 **Wat krijg je:**


* **Fijn team** – Leuke, betrokken collega’s die samen mooie content voor de doelgroep maken. Binnen het Arbo-team, maar ook in nauwe samenwerking binnen het professionals portfolio.
* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.



Verder nog handig om te weten: het gaat om een functie van 36 uur per week. Het kantoor van VMN media staat in Zeist.


**Je bent overtuigd**
