**Your Impact**
---------------


As the Product Adoption Senior Specialist, Change Management, you will join our People Services Enablement team as part of the global People function driving the transformation of our core People and Payroll processes through digital enablement.
You will work with our global People and Payroll communities as we transform the way we provide services to our firm members. The digitization of core People processes is one of the fundamental ways we are professionalizing our firm and creating an unrivaled environment for exceptional firm function talent.
The role will focus on the rollout and implementation of the ServiceNow People \& Payroll product, a part of the firm’s ServiceNow platform, to enable our People and Payroll process transformation. ServiceNow is the firm’s service management platform that provides transparency to work, increases efficiency, and streamlines global processes. We have undergone intense growth over the past 3 years with great success. We have made substantial impact by enabling self\-help and laying the foundation for generative AI (gen AI) and digital workflows which in turn has driven more increased demand for this product and projects continued growth.
For the next horizon of work, you will drive the overall adoption of ServiceNow People \& Payroll, lead change management, and support the People and Payroll functions to fully adopt this digital platform. This includes working directly with our global community of process leads to understand and anticipate impacts and implications of this technology on roles and responsibilities, processes, and workflows. You will shape, develop, and execute a strategy for changing colleague behavior and ensuring sustainable adoption of this platform across all user communities during and beyond initial implementation.
In this role, we will rely upon your passion for learning, passion for helping others, and aptitude to test, fail and try to come up with solutions that help our end users. This role has potential to grow – on the People side: to serve as a thought partner for our global HR, Payroll and People Operations teams to best utilize this digital solution and develop effective user support strategies; on the technical side, to get exposure to product development and system design and recommend enhancements to the product to encourage deeper user adoption.
For the first year in the role, the focus will split. One focus will be on implementations to expand to more groups such as HR and Payroll into Europe, Middle East, Africa, and others as prioritized by our People leaders. A second focus is working with our product team, user researchers and designers to influence product design and development to take into account product adoption. In parallel, you will help support an existing global group of global users that has on\-going training, documentation, and digital platform needs. Since ServiceNow People \& Payroll enables most processes in the People function, you will actively collaborate across a broad set of domains and teams.
**Your Growth**
---------------


As the Product Adoption Specialist, you will be a key member of the People Services Enablement team, which operates within the broader People Technology group and collaborates closely with the Tech Ecosystem. This team bridges the gap between process and technology, leveraging digital tools to drive people and payroll process transformation, achieve business outcomes, and innovate workflows. Covering the entire firm member lifecycle—from talent acquisition and onboarding to learning, professional development, and talent management—you may also partner with other People Technology product teams to ensure seamless integration and support.
In addition to this, you will work closely with the ServiceNow Center of Excellence and Innovation (CoEI), which unifies digital capabilities across the firm, and collaborate with Tech Ecosystem resources like user research and design to ground your change management plans in user insights and thoughtful design.
In this role, you will focus on driving adoption and engagement with the ServiceNow People \& Payroll platform across a globally distributed team in Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Poland, Spain, and the United States. You will design and execute change management plans for global implementations, develop and deliver tailored training programs, and create communication strategies with supporting materials to engage stakeholders. Acting as an expert and advocate for the system, you will provide ongoing coaching to champion user groups, offer guidance to individual users and teams, and address process gaps through digital solutions.
Lastly, you will monitor user metrics to inform strategies, stay updated on product enhancements, and lead efforts to adopt new features, ensuring the platform evolves to meet user needs effectively.

In this thesis, you will generate synthetic training data by transforming low\-poly 3D models of hands and feet into photorealistic images with labeled key points.

**Areas of Interest:** Generative AI, Controllable Image Generation, Few\-shot Learning


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


The examination of Parkinson’s symptoms is highly labor\-intensive, as it requires multiple trained neurologists to thoroughly analyze hand and leg movements. A group of hospitals aims to extend Parkinson’s treatment in the Netherlands to regions where such care is currently unavailable due to a shortage of trained neurologists. To achieve this, they want to make a pre\-selection through the help of AI on a smartphone. Part of the solution is a pose estimation model to track hand and foot movements. However, the current dataset for training the model is neither large nor diverse enough. The goal is to enrich the dataset with highly varied data while minimizing the need for manual effort.


Important features for detecting hands and feet could be better balanced by enriching the training dataset with synthetic data. To prevent manual labeling of the training data, it would be ideal if the ground truth for tracking key points is synthesized along with the training images. By converting low\-poly 3D models with key point rigs into photorealistic images, a synthetic dataset of labeled training images could be generated. Your task will be to investigate how to transform low\-poly models into photorealistic images using AI.

**The Assignment**
------------------


You will create a training dataset consisting of low\-poly 3D body rigs, focusing on the hands and feet. Next, you will explore transforming these low\-poly models into photorealistic images using a pix2pix GAN model. You may also fine\-tune the model to optimize hyperparameters for generating the best results. Your findings will be documented in a thesis and presented during your thesis defense.

**About us**

Although we take more photos now than ever, we seldom print them out. This neglects all the beautiful captured moments, as among these numerous photos lie precious memories worth printing. Be it the first pictures of your newborn, your niece or nephew, the amazing city trip with friends, or a fun night out.

With klikkie, we help you celebrate life and cherish memories. We aim to inspire you to make time for small moments and enjoy the present – what truly matters. Every month brings new moments, and it's a shame to forget them. Hence, the idea is to enable everyone to print high\-quality photos with minimal effort, month after month.

De complexiteit in de wijk neemt steeds verder toe. Care\- en case\-complexe casuïstiek zijn inmiddels écht van alle dag. Als verpleegkundige bij Sensire richt jij je op de zorg van de toekomst waar (pionieren met) innovatie en digitalisering een belangrijke plaats innemen. Spreekt jou dit aan? Lees dan snel verder!
**Wat ga je doen als verpleegkundige?**  

  

Als verpleegkundige wil jij het liefst aan de slag met zorgtaken waarvoor je bent opgeleid: inventariseren van zorgbehoefte, coördineren van de zorgverlening en uitvoeren van hoog complexe zorg met een combinatie van care\- complex (verpleegtechnisch handelen) en case\-complex (achtergrond/situatie). Door de grote diversiteit aan zorgvragen bij klanten in de wijk is het niet altijd mogelijk om alléén dit type werk te doen, daar moeten we realistisch in zijn. Uiteraard streven we dit wel na.

**Aan de slag in Doetinchem!**


In de regio Doetinchem zijn de teams volop bezig om jou als verzorgende IG nóg meer in je kracht te zetten en jou onderdeel te laten zijn van het verpleegkundig proces. Welke gegevens zijn er nodig? Hoe zetten we de beste zorg voor een specifieke klant neer? Welke ontwikkelingen en kansen zie jij? Allemaal belangrijke informatie die jij hebt omdat je letterlijk binnenstapt bij de klant.


Daarnaast zijn er binnen Sensire volop mogelijkheid om een bijdrage te leveren aan (digitale) zorgtechnologie en zorg op afstand, ook als verzorgende IG. Een mooie kans om naast je dagelijkse werkzaamheden bezig te zijn met de zorg van de toekomst. Samen met de klant ga je na wat er nodig is om mee te kunnen (blijven) doen, zodat de klant het leven kan blijven leiden zoals hij of zij dat graag wil. Een voorbeeld is het inzetten van MIJNSensire. MIJNSensire biedt slimme, vaak digitale zorgoplossingen die het leven van klanten zelfstandiger, prettiger en veiliger maken. Dankzij deze zorgoplossingen krijgen onze klanten de zorg die zij nodig hebben én heb jij de kans om je werk anders in te richten.

 **Over onze teams in Doetinchem**


Doetinchem is een veelzijdige gemeente met in elke wijk een andere sociale mix van bewoners, met alle uitdagingen die daarbij horen. Maar jouw zorgteam is je basis, waar verbinding en gezelligheid belangrijke waarden zijn en de zorgteams van de wijken om je heen nooit ver weg zijn. Echter is het ook belangrijk dat je flexibel bent en een ander team ondersteunt wanneer nodig. We hebben oog voor elkaar en zorgen voor een goede werksfeer waarin we steeds nieuwe inzichten en ideeën opdoen die de kwaliteit van onze zorg ten goede komen. Of je nu een groot of een klein contract hebt, routes of diensten werkt, geregeld samen even koffiedrinken of lunchen en af en toe een teamuitje horen erbij. Zodat je steeds met een goed gevoel jouw wijk in gaat.  

  

**Wie ben jij?**  

  

Werken in de wijk is werken in een uitdagende werkomgeving met veel diversiteit. Je weet eigenlijk nooit wat je achter de deur aantreft. Dat vraagt van jou veel. Snel schakelen en individueel handelen is soms noodzakelijk zonder dat je in de stress schiet. Je draagt hierdoor een grote verantwoordelijkheid. Met een gezonde dosis nieuwsgierigheid weet jij de wensen en behoeften van onze klant feilloos te achterhalen, je weet de juiste prioriteiten te stellen en stemt daar de ondersteuning die je biedt op af. Preventie is een vanzelfsprekend onderdeel van jouw benadering.  

  

  

  

**Praktische zaken**  

  

Om aan de slag je kunnen als verpleegkundige vragen wij een aantal praktische zaken van jou:

* Een afgeronde mbo\-opleiding verpleegkunde niveau 4 of hbo\-V opleiding;
* Je bent in het bezit van een BIG\-registratie en bent minimaal bevoegd voor het uitvoeren van voorbehouden en risicovolle handelingen;
* Je bent in het bezit van een rijbewijs;

Een Verklaring Omtrent het Gedrag (VOG) kun je bij indiensttreding overleggen.  
* 

  

**Zo dragen we bij aan jouw werkgeluk**  

  

Er zijn een aantal zaken waar je zelf de regie op kunt en moet pakken. Je hebt daardoor de vrijheid om keuzes te maken die passen bij jouw persoonlijke situatie en behoeften en zorgen voor een goede balans tussen werk en privé.

* Jij maakt de keuze hoeveel uur per week je wil werken. De planner zet dit naar rato van je contract om naar een aantal diensten van zes of acht uur. Je hoeft hierdoor minder dagen per week te werken en er zijn geen gebroken diensten meer;
* Bij Sensire werken we met diensten van 6 of 8 uur die bestaan uit geplande klantzorg en niet\-geplande tijd om te vullen met directe tijd (GFI, rapporteren en inlezen, overdracht naar collega’s);
* De starttijd van de route binnen de dienst kan variëren. Soms begin je direct bij start van je dienst met de geplande klantzorg. Soms heb je eerst niet\-geplande tijd. Dat geeft veel flexibiliteit;
* Samen met je collega’s ben je verantwoordelijk voor de telefonische bereikbaarheid als onderdeel van je dienst;
* Je hoeft geen nachtdiensten te draaien;
* Je krijgt van ons een chromebook en smartphone in bruikleen.
* De functie verpleegkundige valt in de schaal FWG 45 conform de cao VVT. Afhankelijk van de ervaring die je meebrengt bepalen we de exacte hoogte van jouw salaris.

Als AI/ML Engineer bij Inpact ben je onderdeel van een ambitieus Feature Team dat gespecialiseerd is in het bouwen van innovatieve AI\-oplossingen voor de verzekeringssector. Samen met collega\-experts werk je aan geavanceerde technologieën zoals Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML) en Deep Learning (DL). Dagelijks werkt het feature team aan Inpact.AI, om verzekeringsprofessionals te helpen om snel en effectief grote hoeveelheden data te verwerken, waaronder polissen, claims, rapporten, e\-mails, PDF’s, afbeeldingen en andere vormen van digitale informatie.

In jouw rol ontwerp, ontwikkel en implementeer je ook nieuwe baanbrekende AI\-modellen en oplossingen—zoals Large Language Models (LLM’s) in combinatie met Retrieval\-Augmented Generation (RAG). Je werkt nauw samen met jouw team aan het optimaliseren van prestaties, verhogen van schaalbaarheid en het realiseren van tastbare resultaten die impact hebben.

**Een normale dag bij Inpact**

Bij Inpact helpen we verzekeraars innoveren, zodat zij tijd en focus overhouden voor het échte werk. Als AI/ML Engineer bouw je mee aan de toekomst van verzekeren. Zonder poespas, mét resultaat. Ja, we zijn ambitieus. Maar hier geen overmatig werken of competitie over functietitels. Grote ego's laten we buiten, grootse plannen verwelkomen we met open armen. Daarom nemen we ook aan op ambitie, in plaats van op ervaring. Ons team bestaat uit een hechte club van 100 nuchtere collega's (waarvan zeker 70 tech\-specialisten) met een passie voor technologie, AI en Data Science. We doen niet aan gedoe, we doen vooral heel normaal terwijl we complexe data omzetten naar waardevolle inzichten voor verzekeraars.

**Zo bouw jij mee aan de toekomst van verzekeren**

We hebben het al genoemd: wij zoeken mensen die gewoon goed werk doen. Geen poespas, wél baanbrekend werk. Geen opschepperij, wél trots op wat we samen bereiken. En als AI/ML Engineer verwachten we dat je:

* Een relevante wo\-opleiding hebt in Data Science, Informatica, Wiskunde, Kunstmatige Intelligentie of Econometrie.
* Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring hebt met frameworks en tools voor machine learning en deep learning, zoals PyTorch en Sklearn.
* Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring hebt met Large Language Models(LLM), waaronder fine\-tuning, prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\-systemen.

* Een pré als je ervaring hebt met cloudplatforms (bijv. AWS, Azure, GCP).
* Ervaring met data engineering pipelines.
* Proactief, analytisch en samenwerkingsgericht bent.

### **Introduction**


Are you eager to research and develop Visual Analytics techniques for Event Sequence exploration and analysis? Are you curious how to combine and explore the synergy between Visualization and Process Mining? In this project we aim to transform the way we analyze and visualize complex processes.

### **Job Description**


The field of process mining, a branch of business process management, revolves around discovering, analyzing, and optimizing business processes. It does so by extracting insights from event logs, structured records that capture sequences of activities, such as steps in a loan approval workflow, product purchases by customers, or patient journeys across hospitals. However, traditional process mining techniques focus primarily on control\-flow, which describes the chain of activities. This singular focus often neglects other dimensions of processes, such as the time between activities and the time required for specific steps, the spatial distribution of tasks across locations, or the intricate relationships between resources and attributes involved in the processes. For example, in a supply chain scenario, understanding delays, warehouse locations, and inventory attributes is crucial, but often omitted in basic control\-flow analysis. Process mining, as it stands today, is primarily based on computational techniques and algorithms to analyze and optimize processes. Methods such as process discovery, conformance checking, and performance analysis rely on algorithmic approaches to extract patterns, detect deviations, and identify inefficiencies from event logs. Although these techniques have proven effective in providing data\-driven insights, they often fail to use visualization as a powerful means of interpretation and communication. Most process mining tools provide static and linear representations, such as process models (DFGs, BPMN) or Gantt charts, which are primarily suited for experts familiar with these abstractions. This limited use of visualization overlooks the potential for dynamic, interactive visual tools that can make complex process data accessible to a broader audience, enabling intuitive exploration and deeper understanding of multi\-faceted process attributes, such as time, resources, and contextual dependencies and correlations.


In contrast, the field of visual analytics focuses on developing tools and techniques to support the interpretation of complex, multi\-dimensional data. It provides concepts and techniques to explore and analyze event sequences, allowing patterns and anomalies to emerge intuitively. For example, visualizations such as timelines, Sankey diagrams, or network diagrams make it possible to uncover dependencies and bottlenecks in event sequences. Despite their shared goal of deriving actionable insights from event sequence data, process mining and visual analytics have largely operated in parallel, leaving significant opportunities for synergy unexplored.


By integrating the two domains, process mining can benefit from visual analytics’ expertise in handling multi\-faceted data. Visualizations that incorporate temporal, spatial, and relational aspects can unlock deeper insights into processes. Conversely, visual analytics can leverage process mining techniques to enhance guidance and evaluation during data exploration. For instance, capturing event logs while users interact with visualization tools can provide valuable feedback to refine analytical techniques.


The challenge lies in merging these disciplines effectively, combining their strengths to fully realize the potential of multi\-faceted data for visual process analytics. This project tackles this open problem, aiming to create a unified framework that harmonizes these complementary fields, transforming the way we analyze and visualize complex processes.


In this project, the focus is on developing Visual Analytics techniques for event sequence exploration and analysis to enable Multi\-Faceted Visual Process Analytics. The project is performed within the Visualization cluster under the supervision of dr.ir. Stef van den Elzen and dr. Fernando Paulovich.


The visualization cluster (https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/visualization\-3\) at TU/e has a strong track record in visualization and visual analytics for high\-dimensional data. It has generated several award\-winning contributions at major visualization conferences (IEEE VIS, IEEE InfoVis, IEEE VAST, EuroVis); several successful start\-up companies (MagnaView – now UiPath and SynerScope); and a number of techniques that are used on a large scale worldwide.

### **Job Requirements**


We are looking for a candidate who meets the following requirements:

* You are enthusiastic about research in Visual Analytics, Event Sequence Visualization, and Process Mining.
* You have experience with or a strong background in Visualization or Visual Analytics. Preferably you finished a master’s in Computer Science, (Applied) Mathematics, or Electrical Engineering.
* Expertise in the field of Process Mining/Event Visualization is a plus but not mandatory.
* You have strong programming skills in object\-oriented GUI languages (Qt/C\+\+, Java, Python,...)
* You have good communication skills and are able to work in a multidisciplinary team.
* You are creative, critical, analytical, hardworking, and persistent.
* You have a good command of the English language (knowledge of Dutch is not required).

### **Conditions of Employment**


A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:

* Full\-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no\-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.

### **Job Description**


Generative artificial intelligence is disrupting many domains, including communication, education, and academic research. Recently, some companies and research initiatives have proposed that generative AI could – perhaps should – be used in healthcare, both for discovering new medical technologies and for patient treatment. In terms of research, generative AI can find trends and patterns in vast quantities of medical research, synthesising data and making new medical discoveries. In terms of improving medical care, LLMs have the potential to be integrated into the doctor\-patient relationship. They can summarise consultations, and offer ongoing medical advice, and independently provide mental health services.


Using LLMs and other kinds of generative AI in healthcare comes with serious ethical issues. The most challenging of these is privacy, but ethical issues also include: the ability of these technologies to generate misleading or unreliable information to healthcare practitioners, the emergence of “responsibility gaps” in the healthcare system, and issues of social and epistemic justice among different patients and users. Some of these ethical challenges are similar to risks in other domains, but the challenges of applying generative AI in healthcare potentially comes with distinct harms. Unreliable healthcare information can have devastating consequences, which may be magnified if the design of LLMs do not take the privacy of the highly sensitive data they deal with into account as well as issues of justice and responsibility.


This PhD will begin by examining the key ethical challenges of privacy, reliability, justice and responsibility, showing how these ethical risks can be minimised or mitigated. This will prepare the candidate to develop a new ethical framework that outlines how generative AI can be ethically deployed in various kinds of healthcare. The candidate can either choose to focus on how generative AI can be used in medical research or how LLMs can provide new tools for doctors and patients. The candidate will also be responsible for sharing ethical insights with the other partners in the MedGPT consortium (see below for details). Additionally, an interest in analysing the use of generative AI in healthcare from the perspective of philosophy of science or intercultural philosophy would be a plus, although not a requirement.

**Funding \& Institutional Embedding**


This PhD position is part of the *Medical GPT: Revolutionising Healthcare with Ethical AI* project (MedGPT). The candidate will be supervised by Matthew J. Dennis (TU/e), Vlasta Sikimić (TU/e), Filippo Santoni de Sio (TU/e), and they will be hosted by Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Philosophy \& Ethics Group. The candidate will be responsible for working with other stakeholders in the MedGPT project, and will be encouraged to collaborate with other researchers in the consortium.

**Philosophy \& Ethics Group**


TU/e’s Philosophy and Ethics (P\&E) group connects philosophy and ethics to emerging technologies and innovation. Researchers in the P\&E group primarily study innovative technologies and technology\-related problems in detail to enable empirically informed analyses that are meaningful to philosophers, researchers across disciplines, and other societal stakeholders. To do this, the group has established close interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers from groups in the TU/e School of Innovation Sciences, as well as with mechanical engineers, climate scientists, and archaeologists, among others. The group’s expertise covers a variety of philosophical sub\-disciplines, including applied ethics, normative ethics, meta\-ethics, philosophy of science and technology, and epistemology. More information about P\&E can be found here: https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research\-groups/innovation\-sciences/philosophy\-ethics

### **Job Requirements**

* A master’s degree (or an equivalent university degree) in philosophy or related discipline.
* A research\-oriented and impact\-orientated attitude.
* Ability to work as part of a team of researchers working on similar topics, but from different disciplines.
* Interested in collaborating with governmental, policy, and industry stakeholders.
* Fluent in spoken and written English.
* We particularly welcome applications from candidates belonging to groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in academia, including, but not limited to, women and ethnic minorities.

### **Conditions of Employment**

* A year\-end bonus of 8\.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
* High\-quality training programs and other support to grow into a self\-aware, autonomous scientific researcher. At TU/e we challenge you to take charge of your own learning process.

-------------------

**“Kunstmatige Intelligentie voor het waterbeheer in centraal Nederland”**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Kunstmatige Intelligentie (AI) is een techniek die sinds de jaren '50 wordt toegepast. De lancering van ChatGPT heeft gezorgd dat deze techniek in een enorme stroomversnelling is gekomen. Exemplarisch hiervoor is dat ChatGPT binnen 5 dagen al 1 miljoen gebruikers had terwijl een platform als Netflix hier 3\.5 jaar over deed.


Bij HDSR zijn we bezig met de ontwikkeling van een modern data platform met bijbehorende tooling. De aanwezigheid van deze centrale plek maakt het mogelijk om nieuwe technieken, zoals generatieve AI, te gaan ontwikkelen en testen. Recent is er een haalbaarheidsstudie over tooling voor Generative AI uitgevoerd, een zogenaamde Proof of Concept (PoC). De resultaten van deze studie hebben bijgedragen aan intern beleid om (generatieve) AI binnen de juiste kaders en volgens de juiste richtlijnen te gebruiken.


Een aanbeveling die er ligt om het gebruik van AI binnen de organisatie verder vorm te geven is om ***een interne AI\-werkgroep op te zetten***. Deze AI\-werkgroep faciliteert een centrale plek in de organisatie waar kennis over AI ingebracht en opgehaald kan worden, waar vragen kunnen worden gesteld en waar innovatieve ideeën op het gebied van AI uit kunnen worden gewisseld. Een onderdeel van deze stage is om mee te werken aan het opzetten van deze interne AI\-werkgroep.


Daarnaast zijn er nog ***legio andere mogelijke AI Use Cases*** die uitgevoerd kunnen worden. We genereren bijvoorbeeld documentatie over de objecten die het watersysteem reguleren en controleren (het beheerregister) binnen onze huidige administratieve\-, ingenieurs\- en waterbeheer\-werkzaamheden. Of er is in de werkvoorbereiding informatie nodig die intern en extern gedeeld kan worden. Naast deze onderwerpen zijn er ook nog andere toepassingsmogelijkheden, zoals bijvoorbeeld het omzetten van 2\-dimensionale naar van 3\-dimensionale tekeningen of het analyseren van dronebeelden om zwakke plekken in onze dijken te lokaliseren.


***In overleg met jou*** zullen we ***nog een onderwerp kiezen voor een PoC met generatieve AI***. Hierna zal een introductie volgen van de betrokken collega's om daarna de techniek in te duiken en te ontwikkelen. Er zullen regelmatig momenten voor feedback ingepland worden met de betrokken collega's uit de afdelingen en je zal dagelijkse begeleiding krijgen om te zorgen dat de te ontwikkelen producten ook voldoen aan de interne eisen. Hierbij kunnen verschillende werkmethodieken (bv. Agile, scrum, DevOps, Lean Six Sigma) aan bod komen die houvast geven, en waarvoor ruimte voor verdere verdieping is.


**In dit team kom je te werken**
--------------------------------


Je komt te werken in het Informatie \& Kennis (I\&K) team wat onderdeel is van Ontwikkeling, Strategie \& Advies (OSA). Binnen het I\&K team doen we wetenschappelijk en toegepast onderzoek.

This PhD project offers a unique opportunity to work in an internationally recognized research centre and gain valuable research experience at a top\-ranked European university. As a PhD candidate, you will develop your own research project in consultation with the supervisory team. You will conduct independent and original academic research and report results via peer\-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and ultimately a PhD dissertation. The PhD thesis is to be completed within four years. You are also requested to teach.



You will work with the following supervisory team:

* Dr. Eedan Amit\-Danhi (co\-promoter)
* Dr. Scott Eldridge (promoter)


The PhD Project  

This PhD project investigates disinformation at the intersections of gender, visual communication, and political discourse. It studies how women politicians’ intersectional identities are targeted in false and misleading content. As generative AI tools are becoming more accessible and often materialize as deepfakes, disinformation campaigns’ visual and multimodal aspects pose new challenges for political representation and democratic discourse. Through an interdisciplinary approach combining political communication and media studies with a focus on gender and visual disinformation, this PhD project will examine the distinguishing features of gendered multimodal disinformation, its perception by audiences, and its impact on women in the political sphere targeted by it.



Methodologically, research in this project employs qualitative methods, incorporating a systematic literature review, multimodal discourse analysis, media diaries, focus groups, and in\-depth interviews with women who have been targeted by disinformation campaigns. This comprehensive approach contributes to a better understanding of how disinformation campaigns target women in the political context, potentially discouraging them from pursuing public careers. This is a particular concern given that women are underrepresented in prominent political positions, holding head\-of\-state positions in only 23% of countries. When they do reach these positions of power, women politicians are often subject to backlash when they do not meet gender\-stereotypical expectations.



You will be asked to


* Develop your own research project in consultation with the associated supervisors.
* Conduct independent and original academic research.
* Report results via peer\-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and ultimately a PhD dissertation.
* Conduct a total of 0\.4 FTE teaching spread over the second, third, and fourth years of your appointment.
* Complete the PhD in the specified timeframe, namely four years.
* Contribute to scientific and public engagement.


Note: This call does not specify the geographical scope of this PhD project; options include data collection related to Latin America, the United States/Canada, Central/Northern Europe, or the Levant. The final focus of empirical work will be decided based on the expertise and interest of the PhD candidate in consultation with the supervisory team. Consider this when preparing your research proposal (for further guidance, see the section “Application”).

Deze afstudeeropdracht gaat over het overstijgen van traditionele app\-ontwikkeling door het gebruik van generatieve AI en chatbots. Je taak is het creëren van een chatbot die persoonlijke, reisgerelateerde vragen van reizigers beantwoordt, rekening houdend met privacy en toegankelijkheid. Dit project biedt een unieke kans om praktische ervaring op te doen in een snel evoluerend veld.**

**Interessegebieden:** Generative AI, Chatbots, Mobility, Accessibility


Deze afstudeeropdracht maakt onderdeel uit van het afstudeerproject Sustainable Public Integrated Transport Solution (SPITS). Met dit project zetten we ons in om voor reizigers de ideale reiservaring\-oplossing te bieden, het OV veel toegankelijker te maken en een stuk duurzamer.


Een routeplanner voor het openbaar vervoer moet inclusief zijn, geschikt voor alle leeftijden en toegankelijk voor mensen met beperkingen. Het implementeren van een routeplanner als mobiele app is slechts een van de mogelijke benaderingen. Het gebruik van een app brengt echter uitdagingen met zich mee, waaronder investeringen in ontwikkeling, testen, onderhoud en distributie. Bovendien moet een app geschikt worden gemaakt voor verschillende platformen, denk hierbij aan oude en nieuwe telefoons en verschillende besturingssystemen. Dit kost veel tijd en geld, resources die we ook anders kunnen inzetten om het OV toegankelijk en duurzaam te kunnen maken.


Met de opkomst van generatieve kunstmatige intelligentie komt de chatbot opnieuw in de schijnwerpers te staan. Het voordeel van chatbots is hun veelzijdigheid, waardoor ze eenvoudig kunnen worden geïntegreerd in diverse apparaten, zoals WhatsApp of spraakassistenten, zonder dat er direct een app aan te pas komt. Bovendien hebben deze slimme chatbots de capaciteit om gepersonaliseerde communicatie te bieden aan elke individuele reiziger, waardoor de toegankelijkheid van informatie wordt verbeterd.

**De opdracht**
---------------


Jij gaat aan de slag met het ontwikkelen en trainen van een chatbot in een proof of concept. Je maakt gebruik van reizigersdata uit publieke bronnen zoals TOMP. Tijdens het ontwikkelproces zul je je verplaatsen in de schoenen van een reiziger om deze nieuwe vorm van gebruikersinteractie te verkennen en de reiziger nog beter van dienst te kunnen zijn. Bij het ontwerpen van de chatbot moet je rekening houden met aspecten zoals privacy en toegankelijkheid, en je moet in staat zijn om de kwaliteit en toegankelijkheid continu te kunnen controleren.

Het maken en delen van podcasts en video’s kost echter best veel tijd. Hoe groot is het deel dat we in dit proces zouden kunnen automatiseren? Dat ga jij onderzoeken en vervolgens bouwen.**

**Interessegebieden:** Software development, Applied AI, Python, Generative AI


Het met passie opnemen van de kennis in een podcast en/of video’s is pas het begin. Na de opname zijn er veel handmatige en tijdsintensieve verwerkingen nodig om deze klaar te maken om te delen en promoten via social media platformen. Er is al een eerste aanzet gedaan voor het ontwikkelen van het Augmented Multimedia Platform (AMP) om delen hiervan te automatiseren. Denk hierbij het beschrijven van de opname (transcript), samenvatten, titel voorstellen, artikel creatie etc.


Maar dat is slechts het begin. Er zijn nog vele andere features die veel waarde kunnen toevoegen aan het platform. Denk hierbij automatische correctie van gastnamen in de transcript, het genereren van images en slides ter promotie, creatie van snippet (video/audio) als teaser etc. Hierna moet de content ook nog daadwerkelijk gedeeld worden, waarbij we via verschillende social media kanalen ruchtbaarheid geven aan de publicatie. Periodiek wordt de publicatie ook nog opnieuw gedeeld, waarbij we steeds andere quotes uit de opname halen.

**De opdracht**
---------------


Onderzoek welke passende technologieën er zijn om de uitdagingen van de audio/video verwerkingen en verrijkingen te automatiseren. Daarnaast wil je de gebruiker ondersteunen bij het delen van de content via social media kanalen. Bouw een Proof of Concept van de software oplossing voor de verrijking van de podcast/video content. Flexibiliteit, gebruiksvriendelijkheid en uitbreidbaarheid zijn van essentieel belang.


Onderzoeksvragen zijn afhankelijk vanuit jouw interesse en op basis van de features van de opdrachtgever. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn:

* Hoe kunnen visuele verrijkingen gemaakt worden voor de podcast op basis van transcriptie?
* Hoe kan het platform verrijkt worden met publicatie mogelijkheden en scheduling naar social media platformen?
* Hoe kan het platform doorontwikkeld worden naar multi user?
* Hoe kun je specifieke audio/video snippets creëren op basis van user input?
* Hoe kun je het platform uitbreiden met de auto correctie van podcast host en gast namen en biografieën?

De eerste versie van het AMP is ontwikkeld met onder andere Python \& Django en werkt onder andere met behulp van Whisper voor de transcriptie en ChatGPT\-4 voor de tekst modificatie. Deze opzet kan als basis gebruikt worden voor de PoC. De nieuwe features kunnen ook apart ontwikkeld worden om ze op een later moment te integreren.

-------------------

**“Kunstmatige Intelligentie voor het waterbeheer in centraal Nederland”**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Kunstmatige Intelligentie (AI) is een techniek die sinds de jaren '50 wordt toegepast. De lancering van ChatGPT heeft gezorgd dat deze techniek in een enorme stroomversnelling is gekomen. Exemplarisch hiervoor is dat ChatGPT binnen 5 dagen al 1 miljoen gebruikers had terwijl een platform als Netflix hier 3\.5 jaar over deed.


Bij HDSR zijn we bezig met de ontwikkeling van een modern data platform met bijbehorende tooling. De aanwezigheid van deze centrale plek maakt het mogelijk om nieuwe technieken, zoals generatieve AI, te gaan ontwikkelen en testen. Recent is er een haalbaarheidsstudie over tooling voor Generative AI uitgevoerd, een zogenaamde Proof of Concept (PoC). De resultaten van deze studie hebben bijgedragen aan intern beleid om (generatieve) AI binnen de juiste kaders en volgens de juiste richtlijnen te gebruiken.


Een aanbeveling die er ligt om het gebruik van AI binnen de organisatie verder vorm te geven is om ***een interne AI\-werkgroep op te zetten***. Deze AI\-werkgroep faciliteert een centrale plek in de organisatie waar kennis over AI ingebracht en opgehaald kan worden, waar vragen kunnen worden gesteld en waar innovatieve ideeën op het gebied van AI uit kunnen worden gewisseld. Een onderdeel van deze stage is om mee te werken aan het opzetten van deze interne AI\-werkgroep.


Daarnaast zijn er nog ***legio andere mogelijke AI Use Cases*** die uitgevoerd kunnen worden. We genereren bijvoorbeeld documentatie over de objecten die het watersysteem reguleren en controleren (het beheerregister) binnen onze huidige administratieve\-, ingenieurs\- en waterbeheer\-werkzaamheden. Of er is in de werkvoorbereiding informatie nodig die intern en extern gedeeld kan worden. Naast deze onderwerpen zijn er ook nog andere toepassingsmogelijkheden, zoals bijvoorbeeld het omzetten van 2\-dimensionale naar van 3\-dimensionale tekeningen of het analyseren van dronebeelden om zwakke plekken in onze dijken te lokaliseren.


***In overleg met jou*** zullen we ***nog een onderwerp kiezen voor een PoC met generatieve AI***. Hierna zal een introductie volgen van de betrokken collega's om daarna de techniek in te duiken en te ontwikkelen. Er zullen regelmatig momenten voor feedback ingepland worden met de betrokken collega's uit de afdelingen en je zal dagelijkse begeleiding krijgen om te zorgen dat de te ontwikkelen producten ook voldoen aan de interne eisen. Hierbij kunnen verschillende werkmethodieken (bv. Agile, scrum, DevOps, Lean Six Sigma) aan bod komen die houvast geven, en waarvoor ruimte voor verdere verdieping is.


**In dit team kom je te werken**
--------------------------------


Je komt te werken in het Informatie \& Kennis (I\&K) team wat onderdeel is van Ontwikkeling, Strategie \& Advies (OSA). Binnen het I\&K team doen we wetenschappelijk en toegepast onderzoek.
