https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=ffae4899aa0d0e69,indeed,Computer Science | Data Science Graduation Internship: Probability Causality Analysis in Complex Systems,ASML,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Asml,"Veldhoven, NB, NL","fulltime, internship",2024-05-03,,,,,False,,,,"**Introduction**
----------------

Are you a master student looking for your graduation project in industry? Is your study related to Computer Science or Data Science in the engineering domain? Do you have proven experience with Data Analytics? This assignment could be interesting for you!


**Background information**
--------------------------

ASML has thousands of lithography machines operating 24/7 at chip factories throughout the world. Due to their extreme accuracy, problems with lithography machines occur quite regularly. Downtime in a high-end chip factory is extremely costly: nominal costs for customers can be $20 per second of unscheduled downtime.  



  

Performance problems on these machines are manually diagnosed mainly by constantly measuring (at sample intervals of minutes/hours/days) thousands of signals generated inside the machine. These signals are collected daily for all ASML machines in the field. In the past, this kind of data has mainly been used by human experts.  



  

The ambition is to transition to structural automated monitoring whereby software helps capture the knowledge of the experts to allow generalists to deal with common failure modes. Some parameters are monitored and can give an indication of the likelihood of the cause. However, several parameters can represent an anomaly and one event can be caused by several causes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a methodology that better covers all these issues and leads to the most probable cause.


**Your assignment**
-------------------

You will analyze and compare methods to determine the probable causality between symptoms and failure mode from a large population of ASML machines in such a way that shift the decision taking from expert to model based. The goal is to find the most effective method.


This helps disseminate knowledge, check “known” assumptions and, where possible, the system should makes unexpected behavior (“strangely enough X leads to Y”) explicit. This helps empirically investigate complex system behavior and discover forgotten or unknown dependencies. We would prefer actual working examples of the techniques/ideas/approaches discussed.


*This position requires access to controlled technology, as defined in the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. § 730, et seq.). Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such controlled technology prior to beginning work. Business demands may require ASML to proceed with candidates who are immediately eligible to access controlled technology.*

**Your profile**
----------------

To be the perfect match for this assignment, you:


* are a master student in Computer Science, Data Science or something related, within the engineering domain;
* have relevant experience in maintenance, Python and data analytics;
* have good communication and analytical skills, a hands-on attitude, and you deal well with uncertainty. Furthermore, you are proactive and you have a good knowledge of English, both written and spoken.
* have a sufficient motivation to work on this assignment. Hence, a cover letter is required.

This assignment is suitable for a master student looking for a graduation assignment. The minimum duration is 6 months, preferably 5 days per week (minimum 3 days on-site). The starting date is September 2024.


*Please note that we can only consider students who are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship.*

**Change the world – one nanometer at a time**
----------------------------------------------

Become an intern at a Dutch company that’s a global industry leader. You’ll gain valuable experience in a highly innovative environment – one that sparks your imagination and creativity. In addition to a monthly internship allowance of maximum €600 (plus a possible housing and free public transport), you’ll get practical guidance from experts in the field and the chance to work in and experience a dynamic team environment.


**ASML - be part of progress**
------------------------------

ASML is a high-tech company headquartered in the Netherlands. We manufacture the complex lithography machines that chipmakers use to produce integrated circuits, or computer chips. What we do is at the heart of all the electronic devices that keep us informed, entertained and connected. Every day, you use electronics that simply wouldn’t exist without our machines.


Behind ASML’s innovations are engineers who think ahead. The people who work at our company include some of the most creative minds in physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, chemistry, mechatronics, optics, mechanical engineering, computer science and fields which are not technical oriented.


We believe we can always do better. We believe the winning idea can come from anyone. We love what we do – not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard.


**Students - getting ready for real-world R&D**
-----------------------------------------------

We’re a global team of more than 40.000 people of 140 different nationalities and counting. Headquartered in Europe’s top tech hub, the Brainport Eindhoven region in the Netherlands, our operations are spread across Europe, Asia and the US.


In such an environment, your colleagues may be sitting next door, or they could be thousands of kilometers away in a different country – or even working for a different company.


An internship at ASML is the opportunity to get to know not only the world of industrial-strength R&D, but yourself – you’ll discover just what excites you most. Will you design a part of the machine, or make sure it gets built to the tightest possible specifications? Will you write software that drives the system to its best performance, or work side-by-side with the engineers of our customers in a fab, optimizing a system to the requirements of the customer?


**Diversity and inclusion**
---------------------------

ASML is an Equal Opportunity Employer that values and respects the importance of a diverse and inclusive workforce. It is the policy of the company to recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. We recognize that diversity and inclusion is a driving force in the success of our company.

**Data Engineer**

  

Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.

  

Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

 **Job Description**

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

  

Till now, teams within DDP have been ingesting the data of the Data Producers into the data platform, supporting the Data Consumers with accessing the data and even creating datasets for them. This is changing in the coming months, where we move towards our new Data Strategy. So, what is the change you might think?

  

Well, as stated Thor is designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers, meaning that Data Producers can onboard their own data in a Self-Service manner, without having a dedicated team within DDP doing this for them. This makes the data flow easier, where a Data Consumers requests the data to the Data Producers, and they ensure it's delivered for them.


Besides ensuring that data ingestion gets easier, DDP is also working on various enablement blocks on the data platform, to make the life of our Consumers easier when it comes to data preparation for data products they work on. You can think of having a standardized package that builds up a DataMart in a few clicks. It is not there yet but soon to come!

  

So, what will be your job…

  

We are looking for Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen. An inhouse self-built engine for creating DataMarts and datasets on top of our self-service data platform Thor.

  

You as a data engineer will join a team of Data Engineers that has been exploring all the options there are in the market concerning the creation of a DataMart.


We have various types of Stakeholders, such as Data Analyst, Data Scientists but also PowerBI users.  

Our aim is to create a DataMart engine which can be deployed across the organization, allowing consumers to have data modelled like they were used to in our old Data Warehouse called Pallas.

  

We finished testing our first two PoC’s earlier this year, which was a success! The DataMart engine is now being worked on to go to Production by the end of quarter 2, 2024 and many use cases are waiting for this to happen.


To be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataMart Engine, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!

  

That is why we need you!

 **Key Responsibilities**

  

* Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation for the DataMart Engine
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Ensure the DataMart is being built in such manner that it’s a (versioned) package we can deliver, as we won’t be owning the DataMart.
* Train others in making right usage of DataMart engine
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting
* Changes of DataKitchen engine version made available via pull mechanism.

  



**Requirements**

  

* >7 years’ work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* Very experienced with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of Data Modelling, Orchestration and Observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience;
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!;
* Flexible working hours;
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy;
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee;
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train;
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year;
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits;
* A company laptop and telephone.

 **Ready to contribute to our mission?**  

Do you want to play an active role in changing the food retail landscape as we know it? Then hop on board and join us on our expedition. Would you like to learn more first, before you apply to Albert Heijn? We’re happy to tell you everything about this vacancy! An assessment might be part of our selection process.

**Introduction**
----------------

Are you a master student looking for your graduation project in industry? Is your study related to Computer Science or Data Science in the engineering domain? Do you have proven experience with Data Analytics? This assignment could be interesting for you!


**Background information**
--------------------------

ASML has thousands of lithography machines operating 24/7 at chip factories throughout the world. Due to their extreme accuracy, problems with lithography machines occur quite regularly. Downtime in a high-end chip factory is extremely costly: nominal costs for customers can be $20 per second of unscheduled downtime.  



  

Performance problems on these machines are manually diagnosed mainly by constantly measuring (at sample intervals of minutes/hours/days) thousands of signals generated inside the machine. These signals are collected daily for all ASML machines in the field. In the past, this kind of data has mainly been used by human experts.  



  

The ambition is to transition to structural automated monitoring whereby software helps capture the knowledge of the experts to allow generalists to deal with common failure modes. Some parameters are monitored and can give an indication of the likelihood of the cause. However, several parameters can represent an anomaly and one event can be caused by several causes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a methodology that better covers all these issues and leads to the most probable cause.


**Your assignment**
-------------------

You will analyze and compare methods to determine the probable causality between symptoms and failure mode from a large population of ASML machines in such a way that shift the decision taking from expert to model based. The goal is to find the most effective method.


This helps disseminate knowledge, check “known” assumptions and, where possible, the system should makes unexpected behavior (“strangely enough X leads to Y”) explicit. This helps empirically investigate complex system behavior and discover forgotten or unknown dependencies. We would prefer actual working examples of the techniques/ideas/approaches discussed.


*This position requires access to controlled technology, as defined in the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. § 730, et seq.). Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such controlled technology prior to beginning work. Business demands may require ASML to proceed with candidates who are immediately eligible to access controlled technology.*

**Your profile**
----------------

To be the perfect match for this assignment, you:


* are a master student in Computer Science, Data Science or something related, within the engineering domain;
* have relevant experience in maintenance, Python and data analytics;
* have good communication and analytical skills, a hands-on attitude, and you deal well with uncertainty. Furthermore, you are proactive and you have a good knowledge of English, both written and spoken.
* have a sufficient motivation to work on this assignment. Hence, a cover letter is required.

This assignment is suitable for a master student looking for a graduation assignment. The minimum duration is 6 months, preferably 5 days per week (minimum 3 days on-site). The starting date is September 2024.


*Please note that we can only consider students who are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship.*

**Change the world – one nanometer at a time**
----------------------------------------------

Become an intern at a Dutch company that’s a global industry leader. You’ll gain valuable experience in a highly innovative environment – one that sparks your imagination and creativity. In addition to a monthly internship allowance of maximum €600 (plus a possible housing and free public transport), you’ll get practical guidance from experts in the field and the chance to work in and experience a dynamic team environment.


**ASML - be part of progress**
------------------------------

ASML is a high-tech company headquartered in the Netherlands. We manufacture the complex lithography machines that chipmakers use to produce integrated circuits, or computer chips. What we do is at the heart of all the electronic devices that keep us informed, entertained and connected. Every day, you use electronics that simply wouldn’t exist without our machines.


Behind ASML’s innovations are engineers who think ahead. The people who work at our company include some of the most creative minds in physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, chemistry, mechatronics, optics, mechanical engineering, computer science and fields which are not technical oriented.


We believe we can always do better. We believe the winning idea can come from anyone. We love what we do – not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard.


**Students - getting ready for real-world R&D**
-----------------------------------------------

We’re a global team of more than 40.000 people of 140 different nationalities and counting. Headquartered in Europe’s top tech hub, the Brainport Eindhoven region in the Netherlands, our operations are spread across Europe, Asia and the US.


In such an environment, your colleagues may be sitting next door, or they could be thousands of kilometers away in a different country – or even working for a different company.


An internship at ASML is the opportunity to get to know not only the world of industrial-strength R&D, but yourself – you’ll discover just what excites you most. Will you design a part of the machine, or make sure it gets built to the tightest possible specifications? Will you write software that drives the system to its best performance, or work side-by-side with the engineers of our customers in a fab, optimizing a system to the requirements of the customer?


**Diversity and inclusion**
---------------------------

ASML is an Equal Opportunity Employer that values and respects the importance of a diverse and inclusive workforce. It is the policy of the company to recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

Till now, teams within DDP have been ingesting the data of the Data Producers into the data platform, supporting the Data Consumers with accessing the data and even creating datasets for them. This is changing in the coming months, where we move towards our new Data Strategy. So, what is the change you might think?

  

Well, as stated Thor is designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers, meaning that Data Producers can onboard their own data in a Self-Service manner, without having a dedicated team within DDP doing this for them. This makes the data flow easier, where a Data Consumers requests the data to the Data Producers, and they ensure it's delivered for them.


Besides ensuring that data ingestion gets easier, DDP is also working on various enablement blocks on the data platform, to make the life of our Consumers easier when it comes to data preparation for data products they work on.

We finished testing our first two PoC’s earlier this year, which was a success! The DataMart engine is now being worked on to go to Production by the end of quarter 2, 2024 and many use cases are waiting for this to happen.


To be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataMart Engine, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!

  

That is why we need you!

 **Key Responsibilities**

  

* Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation for the DataMart Engine
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Ensure the DataMart is being built in such manner that it’s a (versioned) package we can deliver, as we won’t be owning the DataMart.
* Train others in making right usage of DataMart engine
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting
* Changes of DataKitchen engine version made available via pull mechanism.

  



**Requirements**

* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of Data Modelling, Orchestration and Observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience;
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!;
* Flexible working hours;
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy;
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee;
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train;

**Data Engineer**


Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.


Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform **suite**, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

 **So, what will be your job…**


We are looking for a Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen (*food and tech pun intended*) that is part of the Thor suite. The DataKitchen is an inhouse self-built framework for transforming conformed and cleansed data (*silver layer*) into DataMarts (*gold layer*) that are directly consumable for analysis and business use.


As a Data Engineer for the DataKitchen, you'll be the master chef behind the scenes, and be challenged with transforming and loading data as efficiently as possible and orchestrating all transformations. You'll also engage in stakeholder management, leveraging the latest cloud technologies to enhance efficiency and automate infrastructure deployment. Of course this all needs to be built in a secure manner and be in line with the data strategy to make DataKitchen as self-service as possible.


Currently we’re using the following tech stack to achieve our vision:

* GIT for version control
* Terraform for infrastructure deployment to Azure (we’re thinking about migrating to OpenTofu)
* GitHub actions for CI/CD
* Delta Lake as storage format
* Python for our codebase
* Databricks as our Lakehouse platform (Spark)
* PySpark for data transformations


But you won't be working alone. You will join a team of Data Engineers that are currently productionizing the first version of the DataKitchen. We expect to go into production by the end of the second quarter this year. However, to be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataKitchen, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!


If you're ready to contribute your expertise to shape the future of data excellence across all brands in Europe and maybe even beyond, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey.

 **Key Responsibilities**

* *Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation of the* ***DataKitchen***
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Train others in making right usage of the **DataKitchen**
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting

 **Requirements**

* **5 or more** years of work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* **Experienced** with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of **data transformation,** **data processing,** data modelling, orchestration and observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and on top of that a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience;
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!;
* Flexible working hours;
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy;
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee;
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train;
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year;
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits;
* A company laptop and telephone

Students: getting ready for real-world R&D
  

We’re a global team of about 39,000 people of 140 different nationalities and counting. Headquartered in Europe’s top tech hub, the Brainport Eindhoven region in the Netherlands, our operations are spread across Europe, Asia and the US.
  

  

In such an environment, your colleagues may be sitting next door, or they could be thousands of kilometers away in a different country – or even working for a different company.
  

  

An internship at ASML is the opportunity to get to know not only the world of industrial-strength R&D, but yourself – you’ll discover just what excites you most. Will you design a part of the machine, or make sure it gets built to the tightest possible specifications? Will you write software that drives the system to its best performance, or work side-by-side with the engineers of our customers in a fab, optimizing a system to the requirements of the customer?


*How will you be part of progress?*

You care deeply about continuous learning, not just by doing it yourself but also by mentoring those around you.


* We approach machine learning solutions as full-stack software development projects and use technologies such as Python, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras and Databricks.
* Bringing solutions to production is key, so scalable deployment, model interfacing and model monitoring are important aspects that you will come across.

The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) at the University of Amsterdam is looking for an ambitious and motivated Postdoc in Acoustic Biodiversity Monitoring for a 30-month (2.5 year) position within the European-funded Biodiversa+ project TABMON.  


The central objective of the project TABMON (Towards a Transnational Acoustic Biodiversity MOnitoring Network) is to develop a transnational biodiversity monitoring with autonomous acoustic sensors across a large latitudinal range in Europe, demonstrating how acoustic sensing can complement existing monitoring efforts to fill current gaps in reporting to EU directives and assessing targets of the EU Biodiversity Strategy target. The position is part of an internationally diverse and world-leading team of ecologists, computer scientists, engineers, and stakeholders. It will develop showcases for integrating acoustic observations with traditional monitoring data from structured monitoring schemes, with a focus on Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) of species distributions, population abundance and migration phenology of birds. The showcases will test approaches for model-based data integration with the aim to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

Your work will be embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab of the Theoretical and Computational Ecology Department of IBED. It will involve collaborations with other partners from the Netherlands (e.g. SOVON, CBS Statistics Netherlands, Netherlands Institute of Ecology NIOO-KNAW, University of Tilburg, Naturalis Biodiversity Centre) and abroad (Forest Science and Technology Center of Catalonia in Spain, University of Toulon in France, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research in Norway). It will also connect to other Dutch biodiversity projects such as LTER-LIFE and the biodiversity monitoring demonstration sites of ARISE.  

**What are you going to do?**  


You will integrate acoustic observations from a cutting-edge, high-throughput and fully autonomous acoustic monitoring system called Bugg with data from structured biodiversity monitoring schemes, i.e. conventional surveys with repeatable protocols and/or a stratified sampling design. In this context, you will develop showcases with model-based data integration to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

You will address some of the future needs for EBV workflows as identified by EuropaBON, i.e., developing an autonomous, network-connected, cloud-based, and transnational acoustic biodiversity monitoring system based on EBV workflows with digital sensors and automated end-to-end data streams. The EBV showcases will focus on birds and include improving species distribution data for inconspicuous or night-active species (e.g. harmonizing and integrating different detection probabilities and encounter rates), outlining statistical tools and models to estimate population abundance (e.g. N-mixture models or indices of vocal activities), and quantification of migration phenology (e.g. migrant bird arrival, departure, or intensity of migration). This will provide a basis for near-real time, harmonized and standardized EBV data.  


**Tasks and responsibilities:**
* Handling, assembling and processing large bioacoustic datasets;
* Maintaining bioacoustics sensor deployments and their automated data streams;
* Developing and applying model-based biodiversity data integration tools;
* Statistical modelling of biodiversity data;
* Working with ecologists, computer scientists and stakeholders from research institutes; universities, national parks and NGOs;
* Writing publications in peer-reviewed journals to present the scientific results or developed tools;
* Applying open science principles (e.g. data papers, open source code, metadata specifications).

  


**What do you have to offer?**  


Your experience and profile

The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic (soil and water quality) and biotic factors (ecology and evolution of plants, animals, and microorganisms), and the interplay between those. The IBED vision includes research encompassing experimental and theoretical approaches at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e. from molecules and microorganisms to patterns and processes occurring at the global scale. The University of Amsterdam has excellent high performance computing facilities. Furthermore, IBED has a dedicated computational support team with specialized knowledge of bioinformatics, (geo)database management and scientific programming. IBED also works with non-academic partners to deliver transdisciplinary science for society.  


The position is embedded in the Department of Theoretical and Computational Ecology (TCE) at IBED which focuses on understanding the complexity of ecological systems by using theoretical and advanced computational approaches. A key research focus is to address how organisms cope with changing environmental conditions and how nature and life is distributed across our planet. Within TCE, the position is embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab, a research group which aims to quantify how biodiversity and abiotic components of the Earth system vary across space and time, how they interact, and how responses of species and ecosystems to changing environmental conditions can be predicted and forecasted. The group covers a wide variety of scientific backgrounds, including ecology, data science, conservation science, physical geography, Earth science, and global change biology.

**About us**  


The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic (soil and water quality) and biotic factors (ecology and evolution of plants, animals, and microorganisms), and the interplay between those.  

The IBED vision includes research encompassing experimental and theoretical approaches at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e. from molecules and microorganisms to patterns and processes occurring at the global scale. The University of Amsterdam has excellent high performance computing facilities. Furthermore, IBED has a dedicated computational support team with specialized knowledge of bioinformatics, (geo)database management and scientific programming. IBED also works with non-academic partners to deliver transdisciplinary science for society.  


The position is embedded in the Department of Theoretical and Computational Ecology (TCE) at IBED which focuses on understanding the complexity of ecological systems by using theoretical and advanced computational approaches. A key research focus is to address how organisms cope with changing environmental conditions and how nature and life is distributed across our planet.  

Within TCE, the position is embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab, a research group which aims to quantify how biodiversity and abiotic components of the Earth system vary across space and time, how they interact, and how responses of species and ecosystems to changing environmental conditions can be predicted and forecasted. The group covers a wide variety of scientific backgrounds, including ecology, data science, conservation science, physical geography, Earth science, and global change biology.

**Data Engineer**


Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.


Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform **suite**, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

 **So, what will be your job…**


We are looking for a Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen (*food and tech pun intended*) that is part of the Thor suite. The DataKitchen is an inhouse self-built framework for transforming conformed and cleansed data (*silver layer*) into DataMarts (*gold layer*) that are directly consumable for analysis and business use.


As a Data Engineer for the DataKitchen, you'll be the master chef behind the scenes, and be challenged with transforming and loading data as efficiently as possible and orchestrating all transformations. You'll also engage in stakeholder management, leveraging the latest cloud technologies to enhance efficiency and automate infrastructure deployment. Of course this all needs to be built in a secure manner and be in line with the data strategy to make DataKitchen as self-service as possible.


Currently we’re using the following tech stack to achieve our vision:

* GIT for version control
* Terraform for infrastructure deployment to Azure (we’re thinking about migrating to OpenTofu)
* GitHub actions for CI/CD
* Delta Lake as storage format
* Python for our codebase
* Databricks as our Lakehouse platform (Spark)
* PySpark for data transformations


But you won't be working alone. You will join a team of Data Engineers that are currently productionizing the first version of the DataKitchen. We expect to go into production by the end of the second quarter this year. However, to be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataKitchen, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!


If you're ready to contribute your expertise to shape the future of data excellence across all brands in Europe and maybe even beyond, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey.

 **Key Responsibilities**

* *Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation of the* ***DataKitchen***
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Train others in making right usage of the **DataKitchen**
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting

 **Requirements**

* **5 or more** years of work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* **Experienced** with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of **data transformation,** **data processing,** data modelling, orchestration and observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and on top of that a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!
* Flexible working hours
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits
* A company laptop and telephone

 **Ready to contribute to our mission?**


Do you want to play an active role in changing the food retail landscape as we know it? Then hop on board and join us on our expedition. Would you like to learn more first, before you apply to Albert Heijn? We’re happy to tell you everything about this vacancy! An assessment might be part of our selection process.

Do you have experience with the analysis of acoustic biodiversity monitoring data? Are you interested in integrating data from digital sensors with observations from traditional monitoring methods? Do you enjoy working in an interdisciplinary academic research setting bridging ecology and computer science?  

The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) at the University of Amsterdam is looking for an ambitious and motivated Postdoc in Acoustic Biodiversity Monitoring for a 30-month (2.5 year) position within the European-funded Biodiversa+ project TABMON.  


The central objective of the project TABMON (Towards a Transnational Acoustic Biodiversity MOnitoring Network) is to develop a transnational biodiversity monitoring with autonomous acoustic sensors across a large latitudinal range in Europe, demonstrating how acoustic sensing can complement existing monitoring efforts to fill current gaps in reporting to EU directives and assessing targets of the EU Biodiversity Strategy target. The position is part of an internationally diverse and world-leading team of ecologists, computer scientists, engineers, and stakeholders. It will develop showcases for integrating acoustic observations with traditional monitoring data from structured monitoring schemes, with a focus on Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) of species distributions, population abundance and migration phenology of birds. The showcases will test approaches for model-based data integration with the aim to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

Your work will be embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab of the Theoretical and Computational Ecology Department of IBED. It will involve collaborations with other partners from the Netherlands (e.g. SOVON, CBS Statistics Netherlands, Netherlands Institute of Ecology NIOO-KNAW, University of Tilburg, Naturalis Biodiversity Centre) and abroad (Forest Science and Technology Center of Catalonia in Spain, University of Toulon in France, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research in Norway). It will also connect to other Dutch biodiversity projects such as LTER-LIFE and the biodiversity monitoring demonstration sites of ARISE.  

**What are you going to do?**  


You will integrate acoustic observations from a cutting-edge, high-throughput and fully autonomous acoustic monitoring system called Bugg with data from structured biodiversity monitoring schemes, i.e. conventional surveys with repeatable protocols and/or a stratified sampling design. In this context, you will develop showcases with model-based data integration to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

You will address some of the future needs for EBV workflows as identified by EuropaBON, i.e., developing an autonomous, network-connected, cloud-based, and transnational acoustic biodiversity monitoring system based on EBV workflows with digital sensors and automated end-to-end data streams. The EBV showcases will focus on birds and include improving species distribution data for inconspicuous or night-active species (e.g. harmonizing and integrating different detection probabilities and encounter rates), outlining statistical tools and models to estimate population abundance (e.g. N-mixture models or indices of vocal activities), and quantification of migration phenology (e.g. migrant bird arrival, departure, or intensity of migration). This will provide a basis for near-real time, harmonized and standardized EBV data.

**About us**  


The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic (soil and water quality) and biotic factors (ecology and evolution of plants, animals, and microorganisms), and the interplay between those. The IBED vision includes research encompassing experimental and theoretical approaches at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e. from molecules and microorganisms to patterns and processes occurring at the global scale. The University of Amsterdam has excellent high performance computing facilities. Furthermore, IBED has a dedicated computational support team with specialized knowledge of bioinformatics, (geo)database management and scientific programming. IBED also works with non-academic partners to deliver transdisciplinary science for society.  


The position is embedded in the Department of Theoretical and Computational Ecology (TCE) at IBED which focuses on understanding the complexity of ecological systems by using theoretical and advanced computational approaches. A key research focus is to address how organisms cope with changing environmental conditions and how nature and life is distributed across our planet. Within TCE, the position is embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab, a research group which aims to quantify how biodiversity and abiotic components of the Earth system vary across space and time, how they interact, and how responses of species and ecosystems to changing environmental conditions can be predicted and forecasted. The group covers a wide variety of scientific backgrounds, including ecology, data science, conservation science, physical geography, Earth science, and global change biology.

**Data Engineer**


Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.


Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform **suite**, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

 **So, what will be your job…**


We are looking for a Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen (*food and tech pun intended*) that is part of the Thor suite. The DataKitchen is an inhouse self-built framework for transforming conformed and cleansed data (*silver layer*) into DataMarts (*gold layer*) that are directly consumable for analysis and business use.


As a Data Engineer for the DataKitchen, you'll be the master chef behind the scenes, and be challenged with transforming and loading data as efficiently as possible and orchestrating all transformations. You'll also engage in stakeholder management, leveraging the latest cloud technologies to enhance efficiency and automate infrastructure deployment. Of course this all needs to be built in a secure manner and be in line with the data strategy to make DataKitchen as self-service as possible.


Currently we’re using the following tech stack to achieve our vision:

* GIT for version control
* Terraform for infrastructure deployment to Azure (we’re thinking about migrating to OpenTofu)
* GitHub actions for CI/CD
* Delta Lake as storage format
* Python for our codebase
* Databricks as our Lakehouse platform (Spark)
* PySpark for data transformations


But you won't be working alone. You will join a team of Data Engineers that are currently productionizing the first version of the DataKitchen. We expect to go into production by the end of the second quarter this year. However, to be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataKitchen, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!


If you're ready to contribute your expertise to shape the future of data excellence across all brands in Europe and maybe even beyond, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey.

 **Key Responsibilities**

* *Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation of the* ***DataKitchen***
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Train others in making right usage of the **DataKitchen**
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting

 **Requirements**

* **5 or more** years of work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* **Experienced** with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of **data transformation,** **data processing,** data modelling, orchestration and observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and on top of that a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!
* Flexible working hours
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits
* A company laptop and telephone

 **Ready to contribute to our mission?**


Do you want to play an active role in changing the food retail landscape as we know it? Then hop on board and join us on our expedition. Would you like to learn more first, before you apply to Albert Heijn? We’re happy to tell you everything about this vacancy! An assessment might be part of our selection process.

 ***About Quatt***  

*Quatt is an ambitious scaleup that was founded in 2021 by two entrepreneurs and brothers from the Netherlands. Our goal is to accelerate the transition to sustainable heating in the Netherlands and abroad. Our first product is a smart, hybrid heat pump for the Dutch market.*  

*The Dutch government is strongly incentivizing 8 million homeowners to get rid of natural gas and start heating sustainably within the next few decades. Unfortunately, the current pace of heat pump installations is far too low. Therefore, Quatt is improving the overall customer experience, adding smart control software, simplifying the installation job and, last but not least, greatly enhancing the aesthetics. By doing so, we want to increase adoption by an order of magnitude.*  

*We are developing a highly advanced control system based on several AI technologies, like Machine learning and Deep learning. This system enables us to operate our heat pumps, in conjunction with already installed natural gas heaters, in the most cost- or energy-efficient way, at any given day. We estimate this can reduce heating costs by about 20%. By combining this with D2C sales & installation, Quatt is aiming to reach a payback time of 3-4 years; and thus a very quick uplift in sales.*

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website.

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student.

The Tytgat group is focusing on translating findings from fundamental research to the clinic and specifically on identifying biomarkers in liquid biopsies.


**Position overview**



As a bioinformatician at the Tytgat group, you’ll be involved in projects that tests cell free DNA (cfDNA) through different platforms, such as sequencing and digital droplet PCR, with the goal to identify tumor driven aberrations that could be translated into the clinic for the development of precision medicine in pediatric cancer. Within this project, we are seeking for a highly motivated bioinformatician to develop and optimize computational systems and bioinformatics pipelines to detect genetic aberrations, mutational and DNA methylation patterns in cfDNA from various pediatric cancers, in particular kidney, sarcoma and neuroblastoma tumors. The candidate will have the opportunity to work in a highly interactive environment with projects involving different aspects of clinical research, access to high-performance computing environment, highly automated analytical pipelines and teamwork with scientists who have deep experience in data analysis, data management and delivery of high-quality results.


**Responsibilities**


* The bioinformatician will integrate and work with high-throughput sequencing data, such as whole exome sequencing (WES), gene panel sequencing, shallow whole genome sequencing (shWGS) and DNA methylation from tumor DNA as well as cfDNA from liquid biopsies.
* The candidate will be introduced to the WES/WGS pipelines of tumor DNA that are performed in a diagnostic setting at the Princess Maxima Centre. He/She will optimize these pipelines for liquid biopsy analyses. The comparable liquid biopsy pipeline will allow us to cross check different aberrations in the tumor DNA and cfDNA from the same patient to study the tumor heterogeneity, response to therapy, and early detection of relapse.
* The candidate will work closely with our collaborators from the bioinformatics group and Big Data Core facility, Dr. Patrick Kemmeren and Dr. Jayne Hehir-Kwa.


Candidates with a strong interest in oncology and pediatric cancers, and background in computational biology or bioinformatics are encouraged to apply. Having experience on liquid biopsy sequencing approaches is a big plus. The successful candidate will also have an opportunity to participate in research projects involved in the analysis of the cell free reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (cf-RRBS), identification of breakpoints in structural variants from WGS data, and Nanopore sequencing of liquid biopsies. Experience with developing and running sequencing pipelines, data analysis using R or Python and familiarity with linux/unix is required. Experience and knowledge in databases is also highly desirable.


**Requirements**


* Master or PhD in bioinformatics or similar experience in bioinformatics, computational biology, computer science or similar
* 3 years of relevant experience
* Excellent programming skills, preferably in R (familiarity with Rshiny is a plus), Python, and Unix
* Experience in analyzing NGS data, statistics, working in a high performance computing (HPC) environment
* Experience in working with high-throughput data sets and different variant calling tools (e.g. GATK, MANTA, FREEC, etc.) for single nucleotide variants, copy number aberration, structural variants, and methylation patterns
* Versatile team player able to work in a cross-disciplinary team and dynamic environment.
* Knowledge in biological sciences e.g. genomics, genetics, and transcriptomics is preferred.
* Excellent written and oral presentation skills in English.

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).

We are GNT, an ambitious and innovative family-run business with a colorful character! With our EXBERRY® brand, we are the market leader in the field of Coloring Foods. Our colorings are 100% natural and are made from fruits, vegetables and plants. We are world champions when it comes to utilizing the bounty of nature and strive to continuously innovate and improve natural color ingredients for the consumer. By carefully preserving all of nature’s beauty and goodness, we are able to offer our clients the highest quality and most reliable products. In the future, we also want to offer the most sustainable on the market. This is what continues to motivate us every day!

The most important ingredients for GNT’s success are our employees and the cooperation that exists between them. We believe in teamwork and we are there for one another, our clients, our suppliers and our partners. That is what makes us GNT.

*Due to the strong growth of our organization, we are looking for:*

**Student – Development Support of R and Shiny Apps** 

Within GNT we produce natural food colorants from various vegetables. In general, the first process step is a water extraction of the vegetable, followed by several refining and concentration steps. Typical unit operations are microfiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, evaporation but there are many more. The resulting concentrates are semifinished products, which are stored in warehouses. As a final step, the concentrates are mixed and finetuned according to specification, filled in containers and shipped to customers. These processes are monitored intensively by inline and out-of-line measurements, to assure optimal performance.

**The role:** 

To empower our employees to take better decisions in their daily work, we are increasingly collecting, aggregating and storing KPI data. The KPI data are shown in tailor-made apps, written in R using the shiny package. The apps run in a Docker environment. To speed up our app development we are looking for students who can support us with a wide variety of tasks, ranging from a few hours to several days.

Some examples of tasks on our backlog:

* Many minor fixes, such as displaying time in the correct time zone instead of UTC, making hover labels in Plotly visualizations more user-friendly, fetching additional information from databases to add to certain views, enriching Plotly elements so that links can also be opened by clicking on data points, merging several apps written according to the same template (see also point B), and many other minor adjustments/improvements.
* There is a ""template app"" for a specific group of visualization apps. We would like to convert this template into a package (for internal use), including documentation and automated tests.
* Writing specific R shiny modules to display specific visualizations. These modules can then be called from the ""template app"", which makes it simple to deploy and re-use.
* Creating a template app for another type of visualizations and also turning it into a package.
* Resolving a performance issue in one of the apps. We will likely need to make a different choice/development regarding the ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) for this app.
* Adjusting the Docker environment for more stable performance.

**About you, as our ideal student:** 

* You should already be able to program in R.
* Experience with the shiny package is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of databases (especially SQL Server) is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of Docker is a plus but not required.

If the applicant knows other languages, such as python or C++, this is a great foundation to learn R. We can suggest online learning materials, that we have found to be very useful.

**What do we find important?** 

The GNT values are the basis of our daily activities. That’s why we think it’s important that we fit together. GNT employs people who are enterprising and take responsibility. Customer and service orientation is of course paramount! We always take that extra step to offer our external and internal customers the best service. In addition, we do everything we do as sustainably as possible. We are open and honest with each other and bring out the best in each other.

**What do we offer you?** 

* A full-time gross hourly wage between €12 and €18 gross per hour, depending on your age, knowledge and experience.
* A job next to your study for 4 - 16 hours per week, if you are available for more hours that is also possible.
* A modern working environment with ambitious developers, with whom you can always spar about the latest technologies.
* We find sustainability very important. That is why we compensate - as part of our terms of employment - your carbon footprint.
* A great workplace at a successful and innovative company: GNT is on the move and so will you!

**We color the world, so do you?**

Does this vacancy suit you? Please send your motivation, cv, annual earliest possible start date to wvhelvoort@gnt-group.com. You will soon find out if you will be invited for an introductory meeting (in Mierlo).

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website.

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).

We are GNT, an ambitious and innovative family-run business with a colorful character! With our EXBERRY® brand, we are the market leader in the field of Coloring Foods. Our colorings are 100% natural and are made from fruits, vegetables and plants. We are world champions when it comes to utilizing the bounty of nature and strive to continuously innovate and improve natural color ingredients for the consumer. By carefully preserving all of nature’s beauty and goodness, we are able to offer our clients the highest quality and most reliable products. In the future, we also want to offer the most sustainable on the market. This is what continues to motivate us every day!

The most important ingredients for GNT’s success are our employees and the cooperation that exists between them. We believe in teamwork and we are there for one another, our clients, our suppliers and our partners. That is what makes us GNT.

*Due to the strong growth of our organization, we are looking for:*

**Student – Development Support of R and Shiny Apps** 

Within GNT we produce natural food colorants from various vegetables. In general, the first process step is a water extraction of the vegetable, followed by several refining and concentration steps. Typical unit operations are microfiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, evaporation but there are many more. The resulting concentrates are semifinished products, which are stored in warehouses. As a final step, the concentrates are mixed and finetuned according to specification, filled in containers and shipped to customers. These processes are monitored intensively by inline and out-of-line measurements, to assure optimal performance.

**The role:** 

To empower our employees to take better decisions in their daily work, we are increasingly collecting, aggregating and storing KPI data. The KPI data are shown in tailor-made apps, written in R using the shiny package. The apps run in a Docker environment. To speed up our app development we are looking for students who can support us with a wide variety of tasks, ranging from a few hours to several days.

Some examples of tasks on our backlog:

* Many minor fixes, such as displaying time in the correct time zone instead of UTC, making hover labels in Plotly visualizations more user-friendly, fetching additional information from databases to add to certain views, enriching Plotly elements so that links can also be opened by clicking on data points, merging several apps written according to the same template (see also point B), and many other minor adjustments/improvements.
* There is a ""template app"" for a specific group of visualization apps. We would like to convert this template into a package (for internal use), including documentation and automated tests.
* Writing specific R shiny modules to display specific visualizations. These modules can then be called from the ""template app"", which makes it simple to deploy and re-use.
* Creating a template app for another type of visualizations and also turning it into a package.
* Resolving a performance issue in one of the apps. We will likely need to make a different choice/development regarding the ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) for this app.
* Adjusting the Docker environment for more stable performance.

**About you, as our ideal student:** 

* You should already be able to program in R.
* Experience with the shiny package is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of databases (especially SQL Server) is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of Docker is a plus but not required.

If the applicant knows other languages, such as python or C++, this is a great foundation to learn R. We can suggest online learning materials, that we have found to be very useful.

**What do we find important?** 

The GNT values are the basis of our daily activities. That’s why we think it’s important that we fit together. GNT employs people who are enterprising and take responsibility. Customer and service orientation is of course paramount! We always take that extra step to offer our external and internal customers the best service. In addition, we do everything we do as sustainably as possible. We are open and honest with each other and bring out the best in each other.

**What do we offer you?** 

* A full-time gross hourly wage between €12 and €18 gross per hour, depending on your age, knowledge and experience.
* A job next to your study for 4 - 16 hours per week, if you are available for more hours that is also possible.
* A modern working environment with ambitious developers, with whom you can always spar about the latest technologies.
* We find sustainability very important. That is why we compensate - as part of our terms of employment - your carbon footprint.
* A great workplace at a successful and innovative company: GNT is on the move and so will you!

**We color the world, so do you?**

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

-------------------


  
Heb je interesse in de bestrijding van infectieziekten? Wil je bijdragen aan de surveillance van luchtweginfecties en de monitoring van de sterfte in Nederland? In deze rol krijg jij de kans om kennis en expertise te ontwikkelen op het gebied van infectieziektesurveillance en epidemiologie.



Wat ga je doen



Jij voert de surveillance uit van luchtweginfecties zoals griep, COVID-19 en respiratoir syncytieel virus (RSV). Het RIVM volgt de ontwikkeling en verspreiding van luchtweginfecties op de voet. Op verschillende manieren verzamelen, analyseren en interpreteren we gegevens over luchtweginfecties. Zo kunnen we inschatten hoeveel luchtweginfecties in Nederland voorkomen en wat de belangrijkste ziekteverwekkers zijn. Waar nodig wordt over mogelijke onderzoeksvragen ten behoeve van bestrijding afgestemd met verschillende (internationale) samenwerkingspartners. Daarnaast zul je een rol spelen in de monitoring van de landelijke (over)sterfte.



Je voert epidemiologische analyses uit en draagt bij aan de (online) rapportage en wetenschappelijke publicatie van data en resultaten. Daarnaast werk je mee aan de verbetering van de surveillance en het onderhouden en uitbouwen van diverse datapipelines in het statistische programma R.



Over de afdeling



Je komt te werken als junior epidemioloog bij de afdeling respiratoire infecties (RES). Binnen deze afdeling houden ongeveer twintig collega’s zich bezig met surveillance van en onderzoek naar luchtweginfecties. Denk aan COVID-19, influenza, tuberculose, legionella en luchtweginfecties veroorzaakt door nieuwe type virussen.



Binnen een team van circa vijf collega’s ga je werken aan de wekelijkse surveillance van acute luchtweginfecties. Het team zorgt onder andere voor de wekelijkse update op woensdag van de webpagina https://www.rivm.nl/luchtweginfecties/actuele-cijfers. Er wordt veel samengewerkt, maar iedereen heeft ook zijn eigen expertise. Op maandag en donderdag werkt het team op kantoor en de overige dagen is het mogelijk om thuis te werken. Binnen ons team weten we elkaar laagdrempelig te vinden en is een prettige informele sfeer. Zo zoeken wij elkaar regelmatig op voor een gezellige lunch(wandeling).



Meer over het Centrum Epidemiologie & Surveillance van Infectieziekten (EPI)



Bij het RIVM werken ruim 2500 collega’s elke dag samen aan de zorg voor morgen. Het centrum Epidemiologie en Surveillance van Infectieziekten (EPI), dat valt binnen het Centrum voor Infectieziektebestrijding, verzamelt gegevens om de stand van infectieziekten in de Nederlandse bevolking te volgen. EPI gebruikt hiervoor data uit surveillance om zo tijdig inzicht in trends en risico’s van infectieziekten te krijgen. EPI voert epidemiologisch onderzoek uit, onder andere rondom uitbraken van infectieziekten. Ook onderzoeken wij de (kosten)effectiviteit van maatregelen voor de bestrijding van infectieziekten. EPI richt zich hierbij op de effectiviteit van het Rijksvaccinatieprogramma, de bestrijding van seksueel overdraagbare aandoeningen, zorggerelateerde infecties, antimicrobiële resistentie, respiratoire ginfecties, enterale en vector-overdraagbare infecties en zoönosen. Dit alles wordt ondersteund door sterke methodologische expertise op het gebied van surveillance, biostatistiek en mathematische modellering.



De uitkomsten van ons werk worden onder andere door het ministerie van VWS, de Gezondheidsraad en GGD-en gebruikt voor beleid en adviezen; ook geven we als RIVM zelf aanbevelingen voor mogelijke interventies.



EPI bestaat uit verschillende professionele teams en typeert zich door vakinhoudelijke expertise en respect voor ieders inbreng.

LCI-collega Marion over haar baan



“Bij het RIVM en bij onze afdeling infectieziektebestrijding kun jij bijdragen aan grote maatschappelijke opgaven. Ons werk doet er echt toe. Hou je van het doen van wetenschappelijk onderzoek, maar wil je ook je onderzoeksresultaten vertaald zien in de praktijk, dan is het RIVM echt een plek voor jou. In mijn team kijken we steeds hoe ons onderzoek kan bijdragen aan een betere infectieziektebestrijding in zowel de nabije als de verre toekomst.”



Wat ga je doen



Je werkt voor het centrum Landelijke Coördinatie Infectieziektebestrijding (LCI) als sociaalwetenschappelijk onderzoeker, waar je bijdraagt aan en adviseert over verschillende kwalitatieve en kwantitatieve onderzoeksactiviteiten in nationale en internationale projecten. Zo voert de LCI in het nieuwe Europese project RAPIDE stakeholderanalyses uit onder gezondheidsprofessionals in vier verschillende landen (Slovenië, Malta, Italië en Nederland).



Het RAPIDE-project richt zich op het behoud van toegang tot reguliere gezondheids-en zorgdiensten tijdens noodsituaties zoals een pandemie. Met een stakeholder analyse (middels interviews, vragenlijsten en workshops) identificeren we in ieder land de belangrijkste actoren uit de gehele zorgketen. Hiervoor wordt er nauw samengewerkt met de andere projectpartners om ervoor te zorgen dat andere werkpakketten met de juiste actoren aan de slag gaan. Daarnaast zal de LCI binnen het thema Pandemische Paraatheid samen met interne en externe partijen de komende jaren werken aan een ‘social listening’ infrastructuur waarmee via verschillende kanalen (sociale media, vragenlijsten, in gesprek gaan met, etc.) en op een effectieve manier inzichten worden verkregen uit de maatschappij en vertaald worden in (risico-)communicatie en advies voor beleid en praktijk dat aansluit op de behoefte in de maatschappij. Als eerste stap zullen hiervoor gesprekken gevoerd worden met onder andere collega’s uit de infectieziektebestrijding (RIVM en GGD), communicatiemedewerkers en onderzoekers.



De LCI is op zoek naar een sociaalwetenschappelijk onderzoeker die ruime ervaring heeft met kwalitatief en kwantitatief onderzoek. We zoeken een onderzoeker die zowel inhoudelijk en zelfstandig onderzoek kan initiëren, uitvoeren en/of hieraan kan bijdragen, als coördinerend kan optreden en de centrale verbinder kan zijn tussen verschillende onderzoeksactiviteiten. Je hebt daarnaast een proactieve rol bij het identificeren, opstellen en indienen van nieuwe subsidieaanvragen. Je draagt bij aan rapporten en wetenschappelijke publicaties en je bent verantwoordelijk voor de beantwoording van vragen en voorbereiding van beleidsadvisering voor minimaal één onderwerp/project. Samen met de verschillende projectteams wordt jouw exacte portefeuille vormgegeven.



Je wordt onderdeel van een team van sociaalwetenschappelijke onderzoekers, gezondheidswetenschappers en epidemiologen (van binnen en buiten de LCI), die werken op het grensvlak van onderzoek en beleid. Door deze combinatie van hoog over tot en met concrete praktische toepassingen op de werkvloer leer je beide werkwerelden goed kennen. Je bouwt bovendien een sterk netwerk op, nationaal en internationaal, voor je verdere carrière. In afstemming met je afdelingshoofd werk je ook aan de verdere ontwikkeling van jouw eigen expertise(s).



De werksfeer is open en positief en er is ruimte om te werken in de vorm die jij wil, we werken namelijk hybride. Als je met iemand van het RIVm spreekt zal deze zeggen da er echt een bijzondere sfeer is waar we samen werken aan het het zelfde doel;de functie kan ook worden gevuld voor 32 uur, mocht dat beter bij jou passen.



Wie ben jij



Je bent open, onderzoekend, positief en maakt makkelijk contact met anderen. Hierbij snap je ook welke communicatiestijl bij wie effectief is. Met enthousiasme en de nodige doortastendheid doe jij je werk. Je houdt je ‘oog op de bal’ en bent resultaatgericht zonder de verbinding met anderen kwijt te raken. Jij luistert met oprechte aandacht, bent empathisch en weet junior onderzoekers en promovendi goed te coachen in hun onderzoeksactiviteiten. Analytisch en conceptueel kunnen denken zijn echt jouw talenten. Je schakelt snel en bewaart overzicht in nationale en internationale contexten en bijbehorende communicatie. Je werkt graag in een multidisciplinair team en bent een collegiale samenwerkingspartner vol energie. Je werkt nauwkeurig en efficiënt. Je kunt goed netwerken en hebt overtuigingskracht. Je bent gedreven om de publieke volksgezondheid te verbeteren.

-------------------


  
Hoe verloopt de overgang van de Nederlandse vrouw? Wat voor invloed heeft de overgang op slaap en (mentale) gezondheid en vice versa? Ben jij geïnteresseerd in onderzoek hiernaar op basis van bestaande data van Nederlandse cohorten, dan is deze vacature interessant voor jou.



Wat ga je doen  

Je gaat meewerken aan het analyseren van de Doetinchem Cohort Studie (DCS). Deze studie volgt al meer dan 30 jaar een grote groep inwoners van Doetinchem en er is inmiddels een schat aan gegevens over risicofactoren en gezondheid van deze deelnemers. Je beschrijft de heterogeniteit in het beloop van de overgang bij vrouwen. Je onderzoekt hoe leefgewoonten (m.n. slaap) en gezondheid het beloop van de overgang beïnvloeden en hoe de overgang van invloed is op deze leefgewoonten en (mentale) gezondheid. Naast DCS zal ook gebruikt worden gemaakt van diverse andere cohort studies in Nederland.



Het project maakt onderdeel uit van het MenoPause Consortium gefinancierd door de Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek met als missie: een betere menopauze voor alle vrouwen. De onderzoeksresultaten worden gepubliceerd in internationale peer-reviewed artikelen en gebundeld in een proefschrift.



Een greep uit jouw takenpakket:


* Het controleren en analyseren van gegevens van de Doetinchem Cohort Studie en andere cohort data in NL.
* Literatuuronderzoek doen.
* Presenteren van je resultaten op (inter)nationale congressen.
* Schrijven van Engelstalige artikelen leidend tot een proefschrift.
* Incidenteel bijdragen aan de dataverzameling van de Doetinchem Cohort Studie.


Uniek aan deze baan


* Je werkt met unieke data, die verzameld zijn in de afgelopen decennia.
* Je werkt in een interessante onderzoekomgeving met talloze relevante onderzoeken en collega’s. Het geeft veel voldoening om samen met een team bij te dragen aan maatschappelijke vraagstukken.
* Samenwerking binnen een groot consortium en specifiek met UMCU (1e promotor prof. dr. ir. Monique Verschuren) en Amsterdam UMC (2e promotor mw. Prof dr. Birit Broekman).
* Woon je niet in de regio Utrecht? Dan heb je dat gemeen met een groot aantal van je collega’s. Een goede werk-privé balans staat bij ons centraal. Door plaats- en tijdonafhankelijk werken in te voeren zijn we, al voor de pandemie, gericht op het hybride werken.


Over de afdeling  

Bij het RIVM werken ruim 2500 collega’s elke dag samen aan de zorg van morgen. Binnen het centrum Voeding, Preventie en Zorg werkt de afdeling Levensloop, Leefstijl en Gezondheid aan kennis over gezondheid over de gehele levensloop en levert zo een bijdrage aan het volksgezondheidsbeleid in Nederland. Jij gaat deel uitmaken van deze afdeling, waarin met een enthousiaste groep collega’s gewerkt wordt aan veel verschillende onderwerpen.


  
Functie-eisen

Wie ben jij


* Je hebt een relevante universitaire opleiding, waarin je kennis hebt opgedaan over epidemiologie, statistische analyses, verouderingsvraagstukken, leefstijl en gezondheid.

The Pompe Center at Erasmus MC in Rotterdam is the only expert center in the Netherlands for Pompe disease. The Center has been involved in research on Pompe disease for 40 years, developed the only available treatment for this disease, and has been treating patients with this treatment for over 20 years.

**De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie!**

**Wie zoeken wij?**

Voor ons hoofdkantoor in Amersfoort zoeken wij per direct een AI Solutions Developer.

In deze rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verkennen en implementeren van de mogelijkheden van generative AI, zoals ChatGPT, om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren.

Je hebt een relevante WO-opleiding afgerond of bijna afgerond, zoals Informatica of Data Science, en beschikt over aantoonbare kennis en interesse op het gebied van AI, machine learning en data-analyse. Daarnaast heb je sterke analytische vaardigheden en ben je in staat om complexe technische problemen op te lossen. Ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python, R of Java is een vereiste, evenals kennis van cloud computing en ervaring met platforms zoals AWS, Azure of Google Cloud.

Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief samen te werken in een team zijn van essentieel belang. Je bent proactief, leergierig en kunt goed omgaan met veranderingen en uitdagingen. Daarnaast heb je een sterke drive om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en ICT-management.

**Wat ga je doen?**

Deze functie is nieuw binnen Lab21, wat betekent dat je een grote invloed hebt op de invulling ervan. Je zult een onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren. Als Junior ICT Manager speel je een belangrijke rol bij het implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen binnen ons bedrijf. Je werkt nauw samen met verschillende teams om de behoeften van de organisatie in kaart te brengen en technologische oplossingen aan te dragen. Je analyseert en optimaliseert bestaande systemen en processen en identificeert kansen om AI-technologieën toe te passen.

**Plaats in de organisatie:**

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

**Interesse?**

Stuur ons dan je CV met motivatie.

Een test kan onderdeel uitmaken van het sollicitatieproces.

Faculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science


The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position. In total, more than 1000 employees and 4,000 students work and study in this innovative environment.

Wetenschapsgebied: Sociale wetenschappen  

Full time equivalent: 0.8 fte (32 uur per week)  

Duur arbeidsovereenkomst: 5 jaar (60 maanden)  

Maandelijks full time salaris: € 2.770,- bruto per maand  

Startdatum: 1 september 2024  

Sluitingsdatum vacature: 4 juli 2024  

  

We zoeken een enthousiaste en gemotiveerde PhD-student voor het i-DETECT project over *gepersonaliseerde monitoring en vroegdetectie van terugval bij affectieve stoornissen*.  


**Beschrijving van het project**  

Het i-DETECT project richt zich op angst, depressie, obsessief-compulsieve en post-traumatische stressklachten die veel en vaak samen voorkomen. Ondanks dat deze klachten meestal goed behandeld worden, keren ze na behandeling helaas vaak terug. Als PhD-student ga je binnen het i-DETECT project onderzoeken hoe we met een gepersonaliseerde smartphone-dagboek vroegtijdig persoonlijke waarschuwingssignalen kunnen detecteren die op een dreigende terugkeer van klachten wijzen. Dit doe je bij mensen die een behandeling voor angst, depressie, obsessief-compulsieve en post-traumatische stressklachten hebben afgerond. Je werkt hierbij nauw samen met een team van aan (inter)nationale experts en ervaringsdeskundingen op het gebied van affectieve stoornissen en Experience Sampling Methododlogie (ESM).  


Specifiek zul je in samenwerking met patiëntenorganisaties en sociale partners verschillende focusgroepen interviewen over gepersonaliseerde monitoring en vroegdetectie van terugval. Uitkomsten van deze interviews vertaal je vervolgens naar de dataverzameling binnen verschillende specialistische gezondheidszorgs (GGZ) organisaties die betrokken zijn bij het project. Bij deze dataverzameling combineer je ESM data met klinische variabelen, zoals symptomen, welzijn en herstel.  


**Taken en verantwoordelijkheden:**
* De dynamische relatie tussen veranderingen in dagelijkse klinishe variabelen en terugval onderzoeken met state-of-the-art stistische modelen.

We do the same for foundations and social impact organizations, helping turn innovative programs into lasting impact. **In short, we help public sector partners get things done.** We use a clear methodology to solve problems and help our partners deliver results.

**Experience.**


Many of our people have backgrounds in management consulting, public sector implementation, government, philanthropy, non-profits, think tanks / policy research, and international development.

But we’ve done this long enough to know that what matters most is your skill set and your mindset.

Dit ga je doen
  
  

De energietransitie brengt veel uitdagingen en werk met zich mee. Zo zijn onze klanten steeds meer bezig met duurzame opwek en elektrificatie. Ook worden de kwaliteitseisen aan onze dienstverlening steeds hoger. Als Demand Planner ga je aan de slag om deze ontwikkelingen te begrijpen, te vertalen en kwantificeren zodat we weten wat dit voor ons betekent. Hoe?
  
  

Eerst even over de afdeling
  
  

Je komt terecht in de afdeling Asset Performance Management binnen Assetmanagement. Deze afdeling is verantwoordelijk voor het bepalen van de vervangingen van de assets in ons energiesysteem, het bepalen van het onderhoudsbeleid en storingsprognoses. Door de invoering van S&OP in de vier uitvoeringsketens van Stedin breiden we de afdeling uit met een demand planner Instandhouding.
  
  

En nu over jouw rol
  
  

Als Demand Manager verzamel je al het werk (demand) dat uitgevoerd moet worden voor de Instandhouding en Zakelijk Complex keten. Jouw doel is om een alle werkpakketten in te beeld te brengen en het belang en prioriteit van deze werkpakketten te begrijpen. Je werkt nauw samen met o.a. portfoliomanagers, strategisch asset managers, tactisch asset managers en supply planners om het demandplan tot stand te brengen. Maar ook met de demandmanagers van andere uitvoeringsketens wanneer een deel van het werk daar wordt uitgevoerd.
  
  

Elke keten heeft een eigen S&OP specialist die verantwoordelijk is voor het begeleiden van het S&OP proces. Daarbij kijken we rollend 18 maanden vooruit. Binnen dit proces ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verbeteren en up-to-date houden van het demandplan per keten in de komende anderhalf jaar. Door jouw analyses en inzichten en kan de uitvoering zich op de goede manier inrichten om zo de werkpakketten te realiseren. Of levert jouw inzicht juist op waar in de keten knelpunten ontstaan op, bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van beschikbaar personeel of materiaal, waar we vervolgens actie op kunnen nemen.
  
  

In deze rol ben je constant in gesprek met betrokken partijen in de gehele keten om te zorgen dat het noodzakelijke werk ook daadwerkelijk uitgevoerd wordt. Kortom, je vindt het superleuk om gestructureerd informatie te verzamelen, stakeholders te betrekken en informeren, de juiste overlegstructuren op te zetten en samen te werken met als doel het steeds verder professionaliseren en effectiever maken van de organisatie.
  
  

Maar ook nog over de ‘perks’ van deze job en werken bij Stedin. Zo is de standplaats hartje Rotterdam, waar je trein voor de deur stopt. Heb je vanaf de 11e verdieping een inspirerend uitzicht over de hele regio. En een verse lunch hebben we 7 verdiepingen hoger of bij een van de leuke plekjes in het centrum van Rotterdam.
  
  

Jouw sterke punten
  
Worden we blij van
  
  

Ten eerste ben je analytisch, gedreven, goed in plannen en organiseren en een echte spin in't web. Je bent zelfstandig en kan goed schakelen tussen de werkzaamheden. Je neemt een gezonde dosis enthousiasme mee en steekt graag de handen uit de mouwen! Daarnaast zijn de volgende aspecten belangrijk voor ons:
  
  

je hebt een wo werk- en denkniveau, met een nieuwsgierige mindset en een sterke affiniteit met data. ( In ieder geval een afgeronde hbo opleiding).
  
  

Je beschikt over kennis (en/of bent bereid dit te leren) van data analyses, statistiek en business intelligence (o.a. Excel, SQL, R, PowerBI).
  
  

Je bent analytisch ingesteld, kritisch en niet bang om problemen te signalen en verbeteringen aan te dragen.
  
  

Je bent communicatief en sociaal vaardig om te schakelen met verschillende afdelingen binnen Stedin en passende rapportages en adviezen op te stellen.
  
  

Je gaat klantgericht te werk en weet de achterliggende klantvraag te achterhalen.
  
  

Je bent verder minimaal 32 uur per week beschikbaar.
  
  

Voldoe je (nog) niet aan alle functie eisen, maar denk je dat jij de juiste kandidaat bent? Dan zijn we benieuwd naar je en nodigen we je graag uit te solliciteren!
  
  

Een goed team
  
Daar hoor je bij
  
  

Je wordt onderdeel van de afdeling Asset Performance Management en rapporteert direct aan de hoofd portfoliomanagement. Je zult veel samenwerken met de portfolio- en de demand managers en het S&OP Competence Center en de uitvoerende ketenpartners. Het is een gemêleerde groep mensen van jong (en net bij Stedin) en collega’s die hier al jaren werkzaam zijn. Er is veel ruimte voor eigen inbreng en nieuwe projecten.
  
  

De standplaats is Rotterdam. De verschillende teams komen 1 a 2 keer per week standaard naar kantoor in het centrum van Rotterdam en de andere dagen vul je naar eigen inzicht in. Er wordt wel aangeraden om het 1ste jaar zoveel als mogelijk op locatie te werken om een netwerk op te bouwen en de collegae te leren kennen.
  
  

Mooie arbeidsvoorwaarden
  
Die wil je hebben
  
  

Dat je van ons je eigen telefoon (of een Bring Your Own Device vergoeding) en laptop krijgt, vinden we nogal vanzelfsprekend. Wat mag je nog meer van Stedin als werkgever verwachten?
  
  

Alle financiële arbeidsvoorwaarden op een rij, weet je meteen waar je aan toe bent:
  
  

Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden horen erbij. Zo krijg je, afhankelijk van kennis en ervaringsjaren, een bruto maandsalaris tussen de €4000 en €6648- bruto gebaseerd op 40 uur per week, 24,5 vakantiedagen en bouw je prima pensioen op bij het ABP. Dat is zonder het persoonlijk budget, wat ook onderdeel uitmaakt voor de bepaling van je bruto maandsalaris.
  
  

Bovenop je salaris ontvang je namelijk een persoonlijk budget van 24% (inclusief 8% vakantiegeld). Jij kiest wat je met het budget doet. Elke maand extra salaris? Of meer verlofdagen? In onze Rekentool krijg je een alvast voorproefje van hoe jouw persoonlijk budget eruit zou kunnen zien en hoe je het zou kunnen besteden.
  
  

Volgens ons Stedin@Work concept werk je 50% thuis en 50% op kantoor, wel zo flexibel. Wij zorgen voor jouw thuiswerkfaciliteiten, een thuiswerkvergoeding en reizen naar kantoor doe je met je OV vrij-abonnement waarmee je ook buiten werk onbeperkt kan reizen!
  
  

**Jouw ontwikkeling staat centraal:** events bezoeken met collega’s, meedoen aan kennissessies, trainingen en opleidingen volgen. Zo geven we jou écht alle kans en haal jij het beste uit jezelf.
  
  

Gezonde energie, die heb je nodig. Daarom krijg je van ons ook een Duurzaam Inzetbaarheid budget van € 500 bruto per jaar (bijvoorbeeld voor je sportabonnement)

Bekijk Onze
  
arbeidsvoorwaarden
  
  

Elke maand je Persoonlijk Budget kiezen
  
  

Het Persoonlijk Budget is een percentage van je bruto maandsalaris en ontvang je bovenop je salaris. Afhankelijk van je salarisschaal is dat tot 24% van je brutosalaris, inclusief 8% vakantiegeld. Je bepaalt zelf waaraan je het Persoonlijk Budget wilt besteden. Zo kun je het uit laten keren voor een maandelijks extraatje. Of je koopt extra verlofdagen.
  
  

Flexibele werktijden
  
  

Wil je zelf je werkweek indelen? Samen met je leidinggevende bepaal jij zo veel mogelijk je eigen werktijden. We werken 8 uur per dag. Afhankelijk van je werkzaamheden, heb je de mogelijkheid om, wanneer het kan, thuis te werken.
  
  

Vervoer
  
  

We zijn een duurzaam bedrijf. Reis je met het OV naar je werk, dan krijg je van ons een OV Vrij-abonnement 2e klas. Dit abonnement mag je ook privé gebruiken. Kies je voor een vaste reiskostenvergoeding dan ontvang je 13 cent per kilometer (maximaal 60 kilometer enkele reis) voor de dagen dat je reist voor je werk. Met je Persoonlijk Budget kun je dit aanvullen tot 21 cent netto per kilometer. Krijg je je eigen bedrijfsauto of -bus, dan mag je deze ook gebruiken voor woon-werkverkeer. Voor zakelijk verkeer gebruiken we deelauto’s.

*Bij jij een gedreven e-commerce professional? Dan is EcoTools op zoek naar jou!*

**Over EcoTools**

Wij zijn een snelgroeiende webshop voor bouwbedrijven en klussende consumenten en verkopen al sinds 2005 topkwaliteit tegen een eerlijke prijs.

Zoekt iemand een zaagblad, ijzerboortje, handgereedschap, schroeven, schuurpapier of een koker kit? Dan zijn ze bij EcoTools aan het juiste adres. Met een uitgebreid assortiment van meer dan 6.000 artikelen leveren wij alles op het gebied van gereedschap, accessoires, handgereedschap en bevestigingsmiddelen. Maar ook voor persoonlijke beschermingsmiddelen, schildersbenodigdheden en hang- en sluitwerk kun je bij EcoTools terecht.

Onze klanten zijn o.a. aannemers, schildersbedrijven, loodgieters, parketteurs, maar ook consumenten zijn bij ons graag geziene klanten. Voor iedereen hanteren wij dezelfde lage prijs.

Het grootste deel van ons assortiment importeren wij zelf en verkopen dit rechtstreeks aan de klant. Daarom kunnen we topkwaliteit bieden tegen een eerlijke prijs. Bijna 100% van onze omzet is afkomstig uit e-commerce, daardoor is EcoTools financieel gezond. Om onze groeiambities nog meer kracht bij te zetten zijn we vorig jaar overgenomen door Bunzl. Hierdoor kunnen we (inter)nationaal verder groeien, maar we blijven ook gewoon dichtbij onszelf.

**Jouw rol als Webshop Manager**

Als Webshop Manager bij EcoTools ben je verantwoordelijk voor de webshops in Nederland en België (+ nieuwe landen in 2025). Met jouw kennis en inzichten zorg je ervoor dat elke bezoeker van onze webshops een ultieme klantervaring heeft. Door de juiste presentaties van producten en categorieën, de juiste content en door een ‘seamless flow’ van onze bezoeker door onze webshop naar de uiteindelijke check-out. En door deze ultieme klantbeleving weet je van deze bezoeker een loyale bezoeker te maken die graag bij EcoTools bestelt en terugkeert om meer te bestellen.

Je rapporteert aan de Head of Marketing & E-commerce. Daarnaast werk je ook regelmatig samen met collega’s van Klantenservice, Inkoop en Finance.

Binnen ons bedrijf heerst er een gezellige en informele werksfeer. We vinden het belangrijk dat medewerkers zich op hun gemak voelen en met plezier naar het werk komen. Samen werken we aan een prettige en productieve werkomgeving met ruimte om mee te groeien binnen het bedrijf.

-------------------


  
*Wil jij, met een bedrijfskundige blik, meedenken over de doorontwikkeling van onze dienstverlening binnen de justitiële strafrecht-, migratie- en jeugdketen? Dit zodat onze informatie(systemen) voldoen aan (nieuwe) wet- en regelgeving en ook zodat eindgebruikers nog makkelijker/beter met onze informatie kunnen werken? Lees dan verder.*


**WAT GA JE DOEN?**



Als Productspecialist, zoals de functie bij ons heet, zorg je voor een optimale werking en positionering van onze dienstverlening (informatieproducten en diensten) in de strafrecht- migratie en jeugdketen. Je bent een inhoudelijk specialist en vooral de belangenbehartiger van het betreffende product/dienst voor interne en externe stakeholders. Jij bent dus cruciaal in het verbinden van alle interne en externe betrokkenen.



Je verbindt het interne werkproces aan andere interne en externe (keten) processen en onderhoudt contacten met de relevante ketenpartner(s). Ook signaleer je (toekomstige) ontwikkelingen in wetgeving, (inter)nationale richtlijnen, beleid, werkprocessen en ‘klantbehoeften’ en anticipeert hierop door een vertaalslag te maken naar adviezen, plannen, beleid en uitvoeringsrichtlijnen.



Voorbeelden van informatieproducten op onze afdeling zijn: het Nederlands uittreksel (ook wel bekend als strafblad), uittreksel European Criminal Record Information Services (ECRIS uittreksel), Justitieel PersoonsDossier. Om je een idee te geven van ons werk; we verstrekten in 2023 ruim 7.096.000 uittreksels strafbladen en 39.200 ECRIS uittreksels.
  

Jouw aandachtsgebied zal vooral ‘Ecris’ en ‘zakenstromen’ zijn.



Concreet betekent dat:


* Je volgt en analyseert relevante (ook internationale) ontwikkelingen, wetgeving en ketenpartners, ketenprocessen, richtlijnen en werkprocessen, neem je mee in je overwegingen.
* Door het netwerken met ketenpartners en gebruikers, vooral op tactisch niveau, breng je verschillende invalshoeken in kaart en weet je de wettelijke en maatschappelijke taak van Justid juist te positioneren binnen de processen van de keten. Ook kun je betrokken in- en externe partijen begeleiden en adviseren bij de interpretatie en uitvoering van de richtlijnen.
* Voorlichting/opleiding geven over het product/dienst en promoten, bewustzijn creëren.
* Expertise (van verschillende disciplines) inbrengen in (keten)programma’s en projecten, werkgroepen en overleggen en daar de doelstellingen en belangen van Justid (wettelijke en maatschappelijke taken) in meenemen.
* Je denkt mee over afdelingsplannen en –rapportages vanuit jouw inhoudelijke kennis van het product/de dienst en de omgeving.


Let op als je gaat solliciteren. Wij stellen een aantal vragen om je beter te leren kennen. Je hoeft dus geen sollicitatiebrief te schrijven.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
Je bent een netwerker pur sang met een goede organisatiesensitiviteit. Samen met accountmanagement en informatiemanagement weet je de contacten ook uit te breiden.
  

Je bent echter ook van het doen. Met jouw analyserende kwaliteiten in combinatie met een innoverende aard weet je een resultaat te behalen waar de eindklant blij mee is.
  

Daarbij realiseer je je, dat besluitvormingsprocessen bij de overheid niet altijd zo snel gaan, als je zou willen. Door jouw overtuigingskracht weet je onderwerpen echter wel op tafel te krijgen. Dit komt dan ook vooral door jouw bovengemiddelde communicatie- en adviesvaardigheden. Die heb je ook nodig omdat jij de schakel bent tussen de wens van de klant en de uitvoering en/of ontwikkelteams. Met beide “partijen” kun je dan ook op niveau communiceren. Omdat je altijd met veel dingen tegelijk bezig bent kun je goed overzicht houden. En daarbij is dan Nee zeggen zonder de relatie te beschadigen ook een kwaliteit die goed van pas komt.



Wat lezen we op jouw CV?


* Je bent vaardig in het vertalen van ontwikkelingen/visie naar uitvoering.
* Je bent in staat om vanuit een business perspectief te kijken naar productontwikkeling binnen de justitiële ketens en hebt hiervoor ook een aantoonbare interesse in IT (software ontwikkeling).
* Je beschikt over uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden, zowel schriftelijk als mondeling in het Nederlands en het Engels.
* Je hebt een WO werk- en denkniveau.
* Bij voorkeur heb je al contacten in de strafrecht- migratie- en jeugdketen en daar netwerken is waar je blij van wordt.
* Kennis van onze informatievoorziening binnen de strafrechtsketen is een pré.
* Een affiniteit met privacy en security

Join the Dutch 6G flagship project to help shape the future of communications!


Job description


Join the frontier of innovation in 6G: the future of mobile networks technology! In the Netherlands, a unique alliance of 60 top-notch ICT companies, semiconductor firms, and research institutions has united to spearhead specific aspects of 6G: (1) software antennas, (2) AI-driven network software, and (3) groundbreaking 6G applications. Join us as a PhD student in this prestigious Future Network Services (FNS) flagship project, where research and entrepreneurial pursuits converge.



In contrast to previous mobile network generations, 6G will evolve towards open and virtualized RANs (Radio Access Networks). While this evolution will bring many benefits, like breaking vendor lock-in, it may also introduce new security challenges. Attacks could target the open/virtualized RAN and subsequently permeate to the core network. Novel security mechanisms are therefore imperative for the successful deployment of 6G. Your PhD research seeks to pioneer intelligent security analytics for a zero-trust 6G infrastructure. This includes developing machine-learning models adept at detecting and neutralising threats and cyber-attacks within 6G networks. Your work will advance the state-of-the-art by designing architectural solutions that fortify the security of 6G systems. Additionally, your research will shed light on novel attacks that could target these systems, evaluating their (potential) impact and severity.



Your home base will be the Cybersecurity group, where you will be supervised by Prof. Georgios Smaragdakis. You will also receive guidance, on the topic of 6G, from Prof. Fernando Kuipers and the Networked Systems group. Hence, you will have ample support and opportunities for sparring and knowledge sharing. Together, we will secure the future of mobile communications!


Requirements


Become part of an expansive ecosystem shaping the development of 6G. You will benefit from training in 5G and beyond networks, AI, and software development. Plus, you will gain exclusive access to (1) a state-of-the-art testbed where theory meets real-world application, and (2) an ecosystem that cultivates entrepreneurial endeavours.



Are you ready to challenge yourself? We're seeking candidates who have, or are about to receive, a Master-of-Science degree in a relevant computer science discipline. While a strong background in the field is crucial, what matters as well is your creative flair, motivation, and above all, your passion for comprehensive research!



Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.


Conditions of employment


Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.



Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2770 per month in the first year to € 3539 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.



The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

It delivers world class results in education, research and innovation to address challenges in the areas of energy, climate, mobility, health and digital society. For generations, our engineers have proven to be entrepreneurial problem-solvers, both in business and in a social context.



At TU Delft we embrace diversity as one of our core values and we actively engage to be a university where you feel at home and can flourish. We value different perspectives and qualities. We believe this makes our work more innovative, the TU Delft community more vibrant and the world more just. Together, we imagine, invent and create solutions using technology to have a positive impact on a global scale. That is why we invite you to apply. Your application will receive fair consideration.



Challenge. Change. Impact!


Faculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science


The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI.

Trivium serves a diverse range of customers in a variety of end markets such as food, seafood, pet food, nutrition, beauty and personal care, household care, and premium beverages.


Trivium wants to shape the industry and has embarked on an ambitious transformation journey. In the near term, focus is on building & upskilling the team, deciding where to play & how to win, and increasing financial performance by executing the Trivium Business System (commercial, operational, and supply chain excellence). Sustainability is embedded in our materials and in our actions. Trivium has ambitious sustainability targets and focuses exclusively on products that are infinitely recyclable. Our company sustainability journey has been awarded with a Platinum medal by EcoVadis, the world’s leading rating agent who allocated this award only to the top 1% of the >75000 companies reviewed. Sustainability is embedded in each and every function at Trivium, it‘s in our DNA. The global head office is at Amsterdam Airport; however, many people work in virtual teams from different countries. Our culture is results-driven, entrepreneurial, informal, and highly multicultural. Our people have a high degree of responsibility.

  


Trivium Packaging is driving a large-scale business transformation across her core functions. These transformation programs require strong support from IT to implement new and improved data-driven decision-making, gain better insights in performance, standardize- and simplify processes and supporting systems, and automate & digitalize processes.

This combination of business and technical expertise allows you to define the best possible data solutions for real business needs. You maximize the use and reuse of existing data tools and data flows and understand the impact of implementation choices on performance or on maintenance. The solutions that you specify help the organization to become more data-driven. Your specifications make it crystal clear to the developers what is expected of them, and make it easy to test whether deliverables meet the requirements. You identify and flag opportunities to improve our current data landscape and help shape the data platform of Trivium’s future.

  


On a day to day basis you interact with both business stakeholders and the Data & Digital development teams. You understand the different dynamics of both and easily switch between them. You closely collaborate with the Data and Digital Product Owners, who own the strategy and set the priorities for the data products they own, and with the data architect(s), who set the architectural boundaries for any solution to be developed.

  


Key Responsibilities:  

* Create clear link between the business needs emerging and the potential technical solution required by actively and proactively seeking to understand the business context
* Maximize the value delivered by the team by effectively translating business needs in solutions and workpackages for the engineers
* Guide the team to the best possible solutions within the current architecture
* Maximize re-use of existing data flows throughout the data platform
* Overseeing the effects multiple developments may have on each other, steering towards globally optimal solutions

In onze MI-strategie heeft het ontwikkelen van een robuuste dataomgeving een prominente plek.

-------------------


Are you passionate about exploring the intersection of human cognition and technology? Are you interested in gaining expertise in AI, particularly in the field of *Deep Learning*? Do you have the drive to tackle real-world challenges in assistive technology (e.g., products, equipment, and systems aimed at enhancing learning, working, and daily living)?


Then apply for the PhD position in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence and attention at the Human-Technology Interaction Group (HTI).


**Job Description**


We are seeking an enthusiastic candidate to join our dynamic team for a PhD position. In this role, you will have the opportunity to work and learn about Artificial Intelligence (AI) through close collaboration with *Deep Learning* experts at the University of Georgia (USA). This unique opportunity will not only provide you with robust and tailored technical support but also expose you to the fundamental principles of human-centric AI design.


Assistive technology refers to products, equipment, and systems designed to improve learning, working or daily living for individuals with physical or cognitive limitations. These technologies can range from simple devices like a smart watch and adaptive keyboards, to more complex systems embedding AI technology such as speech-to-text software and smart home automation. While these systems hold the promise to promote accessibility and inclusion, it is not uncommon to encounter users struggling with its complex demands in terms of attention and cognitive workload. Frequently, these technologies lack the flexibility to offer personalized features and do not always dynamically adapt to the user's strengths. AI can however help to overcome this gap. Deep learning models are exceptional at identifying multiple features in large datasets without explicit programming, and have shown to be adept at enhancing assistive technology biomonitoring systems, human–machine interfaces and physical support devices among others.


This PhD project will involve multidisciplinary work to investigate whether and how a human-centric AI design approach mapping individual users' attention and cognitive profiles can enhance assistive technology capabilities to optimize performance and effectively reduce cognitive workload (e.g. inhibition, working memory, attentional control, and cognitive flexibility demands). The project envisions the design and testing of deep learning algorithms designed for mainstream devices like smartwatches, smartphone applications, tablets or visual displays based on individual profiles, both in controlled lab settings as well as in real-world scenarios where conditions can be more unpredictable.


Specifically, the PhD project will encompass: (1) gaining a good understanding of the relationship among behavioral, psychophysiological and brain mechanisms underlying attention and cognitive control functions, (2) data collection and preprocessing of psychophysiological signals recorded from the body or brain, environmental data (e.g., noise, light conditions, temperature, motion, etc.), and/or performance-based cognitive tasks, and (3) collaborating with machine learning experts (a second PhD student in USA) integrating personalised AI into meaningful assistive technology interventions (4) critically evaluating methodological approaches in controlled lab settings and real-world scenarios, and reflecting about its potential to boost the positive outcomes of personalized AI-driven assistive technology.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* Recently completed (or be close to the completion of) a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction, Experimental psychology, Cognitive Science, Data Science or related discipline with demonstrable interest and/or experience in AI [OR] a Master's degree in AI or related field, with demonstrable interest in psychology, cognitive science, experimental methodology.

----------------------


Als ervaren onderzoeker datascience & logistiek sta je aan de wieg van innovaties die de logistieke sector vooruit helpen. Je onderzoekt met welke IT-oplossingen, planningsalgoritmen en nieuwe aansturingsvormen de sector diverse uitdagingen aan kan gaan. Onder andere rondom duurzaamheid, betrouwbaarheid en schaarste van personeel en infrastructuur. Met diverse projecten voor uiteenlopende partijen draag je zo bij aan een groenere wereld. Extra interessant: je krijgt volop de ruimte om zélf onderzoeksvragen op te werpen die de logistieke sector verder brengen.
**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Met toegepast onderzoek innovaties in de logistieke sector versnellen. Dat is het doel van jou en je team. Zo realiseerden collega’s eerder project TalkingTrucks
(opent in nieuw venster) (verwijst naar een andere website)
, waarin een vloot vrachtwagens dankzij decentrale planningsalgoritmen zonder tussenkomst van planners werd aangestuurd. En het project BrightSky
(opent in nieuw venster) (verwijst naar een andere website)
, waarin we de impact van verschillende aansturingsvormen op het bagagetransport van Schiphol simuleerden. Jij werkt aan meerdere onderzoeksprojecten tegelijk, elk in verschillende fasen. Zo ben je ‘s ochtends bezig met een nieuw projectvoorstel, terwijl je ’s middags met collega’s een zelf-organiserend planningsysteem ontwikkelt. De volgende dag presenteer je bevindingen aan klanten of schrijf je heldere eindrapportages.  

  

Binnen onze afdeling Sustainable Transport and Logistics focus jij met een gedreven groep wetenschappers, onderzoekers en projectleiders op zelf-organiserende logistiek. Een relevante onderzoekslijn binnen TNO. En een vakgebied waarin je je hart kunt ophalen als je enthousiast wordt van complexe wiskunde en multi-agentsystemen. In de projectteams heb jij als ervaren onderzoeker een mentorrol, waarin je junior-collega's begeleidt en je kennis en inzichten deelt. Naast je TNO-collega’s werk je nauw samen met partners als universiteiten, de overheid en marktpartijen.  

  

Zie hier meer over de TNO Unit Mobility and Built Environment en de groep Sustainable Transport & Logistics.
**Wat wij van jou verwachten**
------------------------------


Maatschappelijke uitdagingen binnen de logistiek vertaal jij gemakkelijk naar innovatieve onderzoeksprojecten, zowel kwalitatief als kwantitatief. Je opereert zelfstandig en zoekt tegelijkertijd de samenwerking op met je projectteam. Ook toon je initiatief en neem je de volle verantwoordelijkheid voor je taken. Bovendien kun je complexe materie snel begrijpen, die je vervolgens met je communicatieve vaardigheden effectief overbrengt, zowel intern als extern. Wat je verder meebrengt:
* Een wo-master of PhD in wiskunde, datascience, artificial intelligence, econometrie of een vergelijkbare richting.
* Een aantal jaar relevante werkervaring en kennis van het logistieke ecosysteem en de logistieke keteninrichting.
* Ervaring met IT-oplossingen en algoritmen in de transport- of logistieke sector.
* Ervaring met datamodellering en -verwerking. Zo kun je met Python of andere tools data analyseren en interpreteren. En ben je bekend met basissoftware voor ontwikkeling en beheer, zoals Git.
* Goede beheersing van zowel het Nederlands als het Engels, essentieel voor de communicatie met zowel Nederlandstalige als internationale collega's.
**Wat wij jou bieden**
----------------------


Uitdagend én afwisselend werk met serieuze impact. En volop kansen, want bij TNO heb je grotendeels zelf de regie over je carrière. Naast een bruto (fulltime) maandsalaris tussen € 3.866,- en € 4.850,- (afhankelijk van je kennis en ervaring), vakantiegeld (8%), een dertiende maand (8,33%) en een flexbudget (5,58% + €180), krijg je alle mogelijkheden om jezelf te ontwikkelen.  

  

Daarnaast kun je bij TNO een ‘menu’ aan arbeidsvoorwaarden samenstellen dat bij jouw persoonlijke situatie past. Wat je ook mag verwachten:
* Een uiterst professionele, innovatieve werkomgeving, met topexperts als collega’s.
* Mogelijkheid om cursussen, opleidingen en workshops te volgen en congressen te bezoeken, en coaching als je daar behoefte aan hebt.
* 33 vakantiedagen (bij een fulltime dienstverband).
* Een werkgever die divers talent waardeert en stimuleert, met initiatieven als het Female Leadership Programma, onze Rainbow Community en round tables over inclusiethema’s.
* Een uitgebreide en flexibele mobiliteitsregeling, inclusief volledige vergoeding van openbaar vervoer voor woon-werk en zakelijke reizen.
* Gezellige activiteiten met je team en andere TNO'ers. Zo leer je snel veel mensen kennen.
* Flexibele werktijden, de mogelijkheid om parttime (32 of 36 uur) te werken en de mogelijkheid om thuis te werken.
* Een goede pensioenregeling.

As a PhD candidate you will be working on a project entitled “Sticky Practices: The co-evolution of early years childcare, parental leave and women’s labour force participation” under the supervision of Sarah Carmichael, Robert Vonk and Tanja van der Lippe. The project aims to look at how the care of young children is arranged, and what this means for gendered division of labour.


**Your job**
------------


Early childhood education and care is a topic that receives attention both for its contributions to improving later schooling and development outcomes of the children themselves, and as an essential service for working parents (as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic). Reliable and widely available childcare is also essential to enable women’s work in particular. However, how this is provided, what the uptake is and what the further impact is on parental working patterns differs across countries. Given current Dutch proposals to make childcare free or heavily subsidised, this topic is pertinent to assess policy. This project aims to look at how (pre-)school childcare institutions have co-evolved with norms around mother’s work, maternity and paternity leave, postnatal care, etc. You will compare several countries representing a number of different child-care provision regimes and parental leave arrangements over the long-term to determine how various critical junctures have affected outcomes today. This will be done by research into the historical evolution and path dependency of these norms and arrangements.


You will conduct research into the history of childcare services and norms using a variety of sources and case-studies but with the Dutch case as the point of departure. In practice this means you will:


* conduct research in archives in the Netherlands as well as abroad;
* establish a systematic collection of data on childcare norms, policies and financial arrangements;
* attend and prepare material for PhD training sessions offered via SCOOP as well as via the Posthumus institute;
* present research findings and national and international conferences;
* help with knowledge dissemination activities of the findings of the project both within and outside academia;
* publish peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters.


**Your qualities**
------------------

* You hold a Master's degree in a relevant field (e.g history, sociology, economics, anthropology, political science or related discipline but with experience in historical research) at the time of taking up the appointment.
* You have excellent command of spoken and written English.
* Preferably you have a working knowledge of written Dutch in order to be able to conduct research on Dutch source material.
* Experience conducting historical archival research is an asset.
* Basic knowledge of statistics would be helpful but not a prerequisite.
* You are able to work independently as well as within a team setting and take initiative where needed.

----------------------


Meer dan 3.000 wijken aardgasvrij maken. Hoe doe je dat? Welke informatie hebben ministeries, gemeenten en andere betrokkenen nodig om beleid hiervoor te maken. Welke data en modellen gebruik je om beleidsadviezen te onderbouwen? Ben jij toe aan een uitdagende functie met impact Heb jij expertise op het gebied van beleidsondersteunend onderzoek? En ben jij graag betrokken binnen een breed speelveld aan stakeholders?
**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Je werkt in teamverband aan onderzoeksprojecten en beleidsvraagstukken op het gebied van de energietransitie in de gebouwde omgeving. Je verzamelt harde en ‘zachte’ data. Je ondersteunt collega’s bij gesprekken met stakeholders en bij de analyse van de verzamelde informatie. Je levert een bijdrage aan de ontwikkeling van nieuwe kennis en rekenmodellen op basis van recente wetenschappelijke inzichten. Je werkt mee aan het schrijven van onderzoeksvoorstellen die passen in actuele onderzoek- of subsidieprogramma’s of die antwoord geven op praktische vragen van opdrachtgevers. Je ondersteunt projectleiders in de rapportages van lopend onderzoek. Je ontwikkelt je als data scientist en beleidsadviseur.  

  

Een inspirerend team met gedreven professionals: de Ionderzoeksgroep Energy Transition Studies binnen de unit TNO Energy & Material Transition ontwikkelt kennis en geeft strategisch advies over de transitie naar een duurzame energiehuishouding. Deze groep groeit hard omdat er steeds meer aandacht is voor energietransitie in het algemeen en voor onze onderzoeksresultaten in het bijzonder. TNO opereert op niet-commerciële basis als ‘knowledge broker’ tussen overheden, marktpartijen en kennisinstellingen. De onderzoeksgroep staat hoog aangeschreven bij onze opdrachtgevers en samenwerkingspartners zoals ministeries in Nederland en andere landen, de Europese Commissie, bedrijven en andere organisaties die werken aan de energietransitie in de gebouwde omgeving, brancheverenigingen en andere kennisinstellingen.  

  

De onderzoeksgroep werkt met een internationaal, multidisciplinair team van natuurwetenschappers, technisch economen en sociale wetenschappers aan oplossingen voor technisch-economische en sociaal-maatschappelijke vraagstukken van de energietransitie. De rollen, drijfveren en (on)mogelijkheden van overheden, bedrijven en bewoners om (in onderlinge samenwerking) bij te dragen aan het transitieproces in de wijk staan centraal in ons onderzoek.
**Wat wij van jou verwachten**
------------------------------


Je combineert inhoudelijke nieuwsgierigheid naar energietransitie vraagstukken met een drive om nieuwe kennis om te zetten naar praktische adviezen, richtlijnen of modellen. Je werkt graag in teams, maar je kunt ook zelfstandig onderzoeksactiviteiten uitvoeren. Je hebt uitstekende sociale vaardigheden en gevoel voor nuance. Je kunt goed luisteren en hebt oog voor uiteenlopende perspectieven en belangen.  

  

Wat je verder meebrengt:
* Je hebt een universitaire bèta opleiding met affiniteit voor de energietransitie, zoals energy sciences, natuurkunde of vergelijkbaar – of een technisch-economische achtergrond met een goede basis in modelleren, zoals econometrie;
* Je hebt kennis van kwantitatieve modellen en/of methoden voor beleidsondersteunend onderzoek;
* Je kunt goed communiceren met vakgenoten en ook met andere disciplines (technici, economen, modelleurs, etc.), zowel binnen TNO als met externe projectpartners;
* Tot slot beschik je over een uitstekende mondelinge en schriftelijke uitdrukkingsvaardigheid in het Nederlands en het Engels.

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.  

  

Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?  

  

Naast een afgeronde Bachelor of Master en enkele jaren werkervaring zijn dit de specifieke skills die we zoeken:


* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met Python en PySpark.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met een Spark-omgeving als Azure Data Factory en/of Synapse.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met SQL DB en T-SQL.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 2 jaar) met PowerBI.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met Azure DevOps CI/CD processen.
* Ervaring met infra-as-code (IaC) in Bicep en Azure DevOps pipelines.
* Ervaring met verschillende data architecturen en modellen zoals DataVault, Star Schema en Data Mesh.

This PhD position is situated across spatial planning and urban geography research groups.


**Your job**
------------


Participation in urban life is increasingly reliant on the use of digital platforms (for example, Uber, Airbnb, and Funda). These platforms territorialize urban processes, including housing, promising to connect different stakeholders in flexible and transparent ways; however, they also dictate the terms of connectivity. Platforms limit interactions between selected stakeholders and participants, (re)creating patterns of inclusion, exclusion, and inequalities, where the most vulnerable people lose out.


Platform real estate suggests increased transparency in the real estate market between buyers and sellers to address unethical bidding practices and favoritism. However, platforms create new intermediary gatekeeping dynamics through opaque algorithms and technologies, through which unequal housing markets must be negotiated. Previous research has explored the impact of global platforms and short-term rental housing (Airbnb), yet there remains little empirical work on the varieties of platforms that mediate housing markets. This project will focus on the intersection of urban housing and platformization, with a particular emphasis on the city of Amsterdam. By focusing on lived experiences, the candidate will use qualitative methods to explore how different social groups and stakeholders negotiate online housing platforms.


Project Summary


The rise of online platforms transforms the landscape of residential real estate, influencing how houses are bought and rented. For example, platforms like Funda, Brainbay, and Facebook are used to market various properties and screen potential residents. While these platforms enhance connectivity between sellers and buyers, they also redefine social relations and establish new norms within the real estate market. Moreover, platforms function as a dragnet for various data extracted from social interactions, aggregated, and valorized. This PhD project examines the relationship between digital platforms and urban housing markets, focusing on Amsterdam—a city with a distinct and challenging housing market. The research explores the lived experiences of various actors involved in housing platforms, including residents, realtors, landlords, and banks. It also considers the multiple platforms involved in the housing market, such as real estate platforms, social media, and finance. The Research Objectives are:


* To explore how different social groups and housing stakeholders negotiate housing platforms;
* To map the real estate ecosystem for the Amsterdam housing market;
* To analyze the role of digital platforms in shaping housing markets and social inequalities;
* To investigate how digital technologies interact with urban housing regimes.


Your role will involve the following tasks:


* Conducting qualitative research using methods such as mapping elicitation, interviews, ethnography, digital methods, creative methods, and observation.
* Publishing research results in academic papers and policy reports, as well as through creative forms of dissemination (e.g., podcasts, blogs).
* Co-organizing public engagement activities.
* Teaching a small percentage of courses starting from the second year (approximately 10%).


The supervisory team exists out of the following people. Dr Daan Bossuyt & Dr Carl Bonner-Thompson (daily supervisors). Dr Ilse van Liempt and Prof Dr Edwin Buitelaar (promoters).

**Your job**
------------


Today’s increasingly diverse and complex cities produce new and dynamic ways of relating to one another. Globalisation, migration and societal change on the one hand produce contested understandings of caring for each other. On the other, opportunities arise to (re)define caring in relation to changing economic conditions, social meanings and cultural norms. In many capitalist societies, however, existing unjust social structures and conditions continue to reinforce uneven geographies of care. Rather than a focus on how economically competitive cities are, this project explores the ‘caring city’ by investigating how cities ‘work’ and are understood as places that intersect with interpersonal caring, care relations and care work.


By bridging urban migration studies, youth geographies, feminist care theory and critical men and masculinity studies, you will investigate how young migrant men and masculinities are understood as subjects of urban caring. Young males with a migration background are increasingly seen in the public opinion as ‘idle’, ‘disorderly’ or ‘aggressive’ subjects, and therefore a social problem and a matter of ‘urban security’ that needs addressing. In the spirit of finding alternatives based on social justice, and by challenging and complicating public discourses that link masculine migrant youth with ‘aggression’, ‘backwardness’ and ‘dominance’, this project aims to promote social cohesion and the creation of a more caring and tolerant urban life for all.


Drawing on a qualitative and participatory research design, the project seeks to learn from the particular case of Rotterdam and identify lessons applicable to other post-industrial cities. It seeks to establish a state-of-the-art understanding of young male migrants’ care geographies through a synthesis of urban migration studies, youth geographies, feminist care theory and critical men and masculinity studies. The successful candidate is stimulated to bring in their own theoretical and methodological perspectives and publish from the research project based on their own interests, but the research should be empirically grounded and enrich theoretical debates relevant to the intersection of geography, care and migration studies.


The tasks of the PhD student will include the following:


* designing and carrying out qualitative and participatory research activities in collaboration with societal partners based in Rotterdam. Possible methods include - but are not limited to – ethnographic observation, in-depth/walk-along interviews and photovoice methods in the city of Rotterdam;
* reporting on research findings in the form of international peer reviewed articles and policy reports, as well as through creative forms of dissemination suitable for the target group and social actors (e.g., podcast, blog, zine-making, photo exhibition);
* co-organising public engagement activities (e.g., one or more expert meetings with a variety of stakeholders to reflect on the project’s findings and recommendations for policy, one or more public events for lay audiences to facilitate discussion).


In addition to research-related activities, the PhD candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to teaching activities in Urban Geography and Spatial Planning at Bachelor and Master level, as well as education for professionals.


The successful candidate will be funded by the Geosciences Graduate School of Utrecht University to support project development (e.g. training courses, summer schools, conferences, etc.), data collection and dissemination. The project is situated within the Urban Geography section at the Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning at Utrecht University. The candidate will have other opportunities for development through the university-wide platforms of Dynamics of Youth (DoY) and Institutions of Open Societies (IOS).

**Why?**

Every swipe, every like, every TikTok video we upload, every Zoom call we have, every Netflix video we watch, or everything we buy online is all processed and depends on… data centers. However, these data centers consume large amounts of energy due to the underlying technology we use every day all day.

**How?**

We have developed an AI-based analytics platform that captures the entire data center (DC) infrastructure—""from roof to room""—to bring the whole DC into a more optimal state. This platform saves energy, water, and scope 3 emissions while increasing reliability and sustainability in data centers across countries like Germany, France, the UK, Australia, and The Netherlands.

Dus je schrijft niet de code om eenmalig een data product te leveren, maar productiecode om volledige datastraten op geautomatiseerde, geschedulde wijze in productie te brengen. Vervolgens ben je in staat om deze datastraten te onderhouden, verbeteren en “live” te houden. Hiervoor is een uitstekende programmeervaardigheid en kennis van databronnen inclusief achterhalen van business behoeftes vereist. Verder vind je het leuk om je te verdiepen in de nieuwste technische platformen, zoals Azure, die beschikbaar zijn binnen Achmea. Ook ben je een inspirerend voorbeeld voor je collega’s op inhoud en weet je hierop de lijn uit te zetten voor je collega data engineers.  

Kortom, zijn we op zoek naar een gecombineerde skillset van programmeren, cloud ervaring, datamodelkennis en een inspirerend voorbeeld voor de andere collega’s.  

  

**Hoe ziet je dag eruit?**  

Je bent bezig met het implementeren van een nieuwe databron in het datamodel van ons 360 graden klantbeeld. Naast de technische uitdaging om dit voor elkaar te krijgen in Azure, wil je je collega data engineers laten zien hoe de opzet van jouw data product gaat helpen om nieuwe toekomstige data producten te ontwikkelen. Hiervoor geef je in de middag een presentatie waarin je ze meeneemt in je data product en hoe deze is opgenomen in het 360 graden klantbeeld. Na deze geslaagde meeting bespreek je in de middag met architecten van Zilveren Kruis IT over de gewenste functionaliteiten voor het dataplatform, zodat hier meer snelheid en flexbiliteit ontstaat voor het data engineering team.  

**De afdeling**  


Je bent werkzaam binnen het chapter Data Engineering & Science, onderdeel van de afdeling Customer Center of Data (ongeveer 40 collega’s). Het chapter bestaat uit 12 collega’s (data engineers en data scientists). De afdeling Customer Center of Data werkt primair voor het merk Zilveren Kruis, maar bedient ook de andere zorgmerken van Achmea: De Friesland, FBTO, Interpolis en De Christelijke Zorgverzekeraar. Op de afdeling behoort Agile Kanban tot de dagelijkse manier van werken. Aandachtsgebieden van de afdeling zijn het ontwikkelen van het 360 graden klantbeeld, het automatiseren of verbeteren van operationele processen door middel van AI en het doen van analyses (m.b.v. AI) op strategie, kanalen, customer journeys en propositieontwikkeling (diensten, services), pricing en marktonderzoek.  

Achmea heeft hybride werken ingevoerd, wat betekent dat je minimaal 1 dag in de week op kantoor in Leiden werkt en verder zelf kan bepalen waar en wanneer jij werkt.**Jouw achtergrond**  

“We zijn op zoek naar iemand met een sterke persoonlijkheid én drive. Iemand die het leuk vindt om een data engineering binnen Zilveren Kruis een stap verder te brengen op de toepassing van de Azure Cloud-oplossingen. Jij stapt actief op je collega data experts af, voert dialogen en onderzoekt op basis daarvan welk nodig is. Je bent tevens goed in programmeren in Python en Spark, hebt een mindset waarin je zoveel mogelijk een geautomatiseerd datamodel wilt neerzetten en weet deze uit te dragen naar je collega data engineers.”

* **Daarnaast:**Heb je een afgeronde WO-opleiding met een master in Computer Science, Software Engineering, of een gerelateerde beta master;
* Heb je een gedegen IT-achtergrond en minimaal 4 jaar werkervaring in het data-vakgebied;
* Ben je goed in het ontwikkelen van data modellen. Kennis van data vault of andere datamodelleringsmethoden zijn een pré;
* Heb je uitstekende programmeervaardigheden in Python, Spark en SQL en vind je het leuk om geautomatiseerde, geschedulde datastraten neer te zetten;
* Heb je kennis van Azure Cloud-oplossingen (Azure Data Factory, Azure DataLake Storage, Azure Synapse, Power BI, Analysis Services);
* Ben je een inspirerend voorbeeld op inhoud voor je collega data engineers en weet je ze mee te nemen op jouw inhoudelijke visie;
* Ben je een gesprekspartner voor de business en kun je ze enthousiasmeren over de toegevoegde waarde van jouw data producten.

Join our team!


**Your job**
------------


While academic literature presents the Holocaust in the Netherlands as a linear, streamlined Nazi-attack on Jews, centered in Amsterdam and other big cities of Western Holland, over a third of the approximately 104,000 deported Dutch Jews came from small towns and villages. New local studies indicate local differentiations, yet systematic research of the impact of local dynamics on the course of the genocide outside the urban centers of Western Holland and, vice versa, the impact of the genocide on these local dynamics is still lacking. How did local political actors, social structures, associational life, and cultural customs affect the course of the genocide? How did routes of evasion develop, inside and between local communities? And how did local communities recuperate from the years of persecution?


In our project we address these new exciting questions. We turn away from Amsterdam and other big cities, and investigate a carefully chosen selection of provincial towns between 1925 and 1950, combining close-up research with comparative analysis and Digital Humanities methods of data analysis and visualisation. This integrative approach will enable us to explain the role of local political actors (PhD-subproject 1), the impact of (inter)communal networks on Jewish escape (Postdoc-subproject 2) and the entanglement of local social and cultural dynamics with the genocidal process (Postdoc-subproject 3).


As the Postdoc-researcher of subproject 3, you will be pioneering in the field of the socio-cultural history of the Holocaust in the Dutch *mediene*. Your focus will be the social tissue of communal life, individual relations between Jews and non-Jews and civil society organisations that have thus far often remained out of the scope of investigation. In your research you will be working closely together with other members of the research team that is headed by Geraldien von Frijtag (UU), Ido de Haan (UU) and Dienke Hondius (VU).


You will have the following tasks and responsibilities:


* conducting research within the period of appointment;
* publishing peer-reviewed journal articles and co-editing a volume;
* helping with the organisation of events, workshop or conference;
* participating in project meetings, and closely collaborating with the other members of the research team;
* assisting with knowledge dissemination and other activities of the project;
* presenting research results at national and international workshops and conferences.


**Your qualities**
------------------


General qualifications:


* You hold a PhD degree in Holocaust and Genocide Studies, History, Sociology, Anthropology or Cultural studies, or a comparable field.
* You have excellent command of spoken and written Dutch and English.
* You are able to work independently and to write academic publications and publications aimed at wider dissemination of research.
* You have team spirit and experience working with others.
* You have strong interpersonal, analytical and organisational skills.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for 2 years;
* a working week of 32 hours and a gross monthly salary of €4,332 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale 11 of the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth. For more information, please visit working at Utrecht University.


**About us**

-------------------


The Data and AI cluster at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) is searching for candidates for one fully-funded 5-year PhD-TA position. Of the time in the position, 75% will be spent on fundamental scientific research: the primary goal is to enrich the portfolio of available data mining techniques with new innovative methods. The remaining 25% of the time in the position will be spent contributing to the teaching duties of the Data and AI cluster. Hence, this position is an ideal springboard for an academic career: during your PhD trajectory, in which you will contribute fundamental advances to data mining research, you will also build up a portfolio of academic teaching experience. Upon successful completion of this position, your CV will be very attractive for universities with open tenure-track positions.


The scientific framework in which the position is grounded is Exceptional Model Mining (EMM), a data mining framework that strives to find subgroups within a dataset that are interesting. Subgroups are only deemed interesting if they satisfy two conditions. On the one hand, they must be interpretable: we must be able to succinctly describe the definition of a subgroup, so that the knowledge that they represent becomes actionable. On the other hand, they must be exceptional: they must display some kind of behavior that sets them apart from overall behavior. The scientific challenges revolve around how to efficiently search for subgroups, and how to express exceptional behavior such that the subgroups we find are meaningful.


Making an efficient traversal of the combinatorially-large subgroup search space is already challenging in traditional, cross-sectional data. In this PhD position, the main research challenge is to create efficient algorithms to search for exceptional subgroups in data that varies over time. The problem space encompasses both heuristic algorithms, such as Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Pattern Sampling, and exhaustive algorithms, where we will investigate Optimistic Estimates, GP-Growth, and Significant Pattern Mining. We may also look into whether the anytime algorithm with guarantees for Subgroup Discovery, called “Refine&Mine”, can be expanded to EMM settings. Completely fresh algorithmic ideas to tackle EMM are also most welcome. Please consult the PDF-document for further details about the project description encompassing this PhD position.


TU/e is a dynamic, research-intensive university in the heart of Europe. TU/e is consistently ranked within the top-100 positions in several world rankings for its research and quality of education. The Data and AI cluster consists of 18 professors, 1 lecturer, 3 postdoctoral researchers, 41 PhD students, and 7 research engineers. The research results of the cluster appear in top-tier conferences and journals including but not limited to SDM, KDD, ECML PKDD, ICDM, AAAI, DAMI, MACH, and KAIS. The cluster has close collaboration with several leading companies, organizations, and hospitals.


The successful candidate will be based in the Data Mining group of the DAI cluster, where opportunities are available to collaborate with other PhDs and to co-supervise MSc students on topics relevant to your research. Your research will be concluded with a PhD thesis. You will be supervised by dr. Wouter Duivesteijn and prof. dr. Mykola Pechenizkiy.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

***A solid background in computer science with specialization in data mining and/or machine learning; a minor in mathematics is a plus;***


* A strong interest in data mining research with focus on local pattern mining, exceptional model mining, or related techniques.
* Data mining software development skills in at least one language, e.g. R, Python, Java.
* Good communication skills in English, both in speaking and in writing.
* Capability and willingness to work both independently and in a team of data scientists, and interact with domain experts; being highly motivated, rigorous, and disciplined.
* Being enthusiastic about working on challenging use cases.
* Affinity with contributing to teaching data mining at a university level; teaching experience will be considered an additional advantage.
* Experience in research and a publication record will be considered additional advantages.

**Conditions of employment**
----------------------------


A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:


* Full-time employment for five years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 25% of your employment on teaching tasks.
* Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the *Collective Labour Agreement* for Dutch Universities, scale P (min. €2,770 max. €3,539).
* A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
* High-quality training programs and other support to grow into a self-aware, autonomous scientific researcher. At TU/e we challenge you to take charge of your own learning process.
* An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
* An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
* A Staff Immigration Team and a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) for international candidates.

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.  

  

Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?  

  

Naast een afgeronde Bachelor of Master en enkele jaren werkervaring zijn dit de specifieke skills die we zoeken:


* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met Python en PySpark.

* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met SQL DB en T-SQL.

* Ervaring met infra-as-code (IaC) in Bicep en Azure DevOps pipelines.
* Ervaring met verschillende data architecturen en modellen zoals DataVault, Star Schema en Data Mesh.

* Align with colleagues on solution design and architecture

FLUX is hét model voor de gerealiseerde reizigersaantallen bij NS. Deze gegevens zijn cruciaal voor diverse bedrijfsprocessen, zoals het verantwoorden van de prestaties aan het ministerie, inzicht geven in de drukte in de treinen en op stations, tot aan de ontwikkeling van reizigersprognoses voor het materieelplan. Zodoende heb je directe impact in het beschikbaar maken van inzichten over onze reizigers.

* Je haalt plezier uit analyseren van technische problemen en het optimaliseren van het (operations-) proces om zo het gebruik van de data voor de afnemers zo soepel mogelijk te maken
* Je werkt graag in een agile team met andere data engineers en data scientists
* Het geeft je energie om continu te innoveren en tegelijkertijd stabiele en betrouwbare resultaten te leveren

**Dit ga je doen**  
Onze missie bij de NS is om Nederland duurzaam bereikbaar te houden, voor iedereen. Inzichten in de reizigersstromen zijn hierbij onmisbaar voor een optimale dienstverlening. Met behulp van geavanceerde modellen bepalen we hoeveel reizigers tussen stations hebben gereisd en met welke treinen ze dat hebben gedaan, ook als ze een keer vergeten zijn om uit te checken.

Team FLUX werkt aan het model dat onze reizigers achteraf toedeelt aan gereden treinen. FLUX is een belangrijke bron voor een diverse groep afnemers binnen NS. Het is van groot belang dat we deze gegevens tijdig, volledig en accuraat aanleveren.

Wij zijn op zoek naar een teamlid met een achtergrond in Data Engineering of MLOps Engineering om ons te helpen FLUX verder te verbeteren.

Om de kwaliteit van het FLUX-model zo hoog mogelijk te houden, werken we continu aan innovaties op het model en de processen. Op korte termijn willen we onze operationele workflows verbeteren om issues snel te identificeren en op te lossen.

Daarnaast liggen er plannen klaar om de kwaliteit van FLUX verder te verhogen, nieuwe bronnen te verwerken, FLUX te versnellen en onze infrastructuur te professionaliseren. Kortom, genoeg uitdagend werk te doen!

**Hier ga je werken**

Op loopafstand van station Utrecht Centraal bundelen zo´n 200 collega´s van de afdeling Data, Innovatie & Analyse (DIA) hun krachten. Hier werkt een mix van ervaringen en persoonlijkheden, die elkaar graag opzoeken om met elkaar te sparren en kennis te delen. De afdeling geeft (interne) gebruikers snel en betrouwbaar inzicht om tot juiste acties te komen door het verzamelen, combineren, analyseren en presenteren van informatie. Als ontwikkelaar in FLUX ben je onderdeel van het Advanced Analytics team, maar overleg je ook veel met collega’s uit andere vakgebieden. Met jou bestaat het team FLUX uit negen personen, inclusief de product owner en scrum master.  
Vanuit DIA werken we samen met collega’s uit IT en de business in multidisciplinaire clusters. Team FLUX valt binnen het cluster Reizigersstromen. Dit cluster bestaat uit ongeveer 30 collega's die gezamenlijk verantwoordelijk zijn voor het leveren en verbeteren van data, inzichten en advies over reizigersstromen, zowel gerealiseerd als prognoses voor de toekomst.

Daarnaast maakt FLUX deel uit van het DIA Advanced Analytics (AA) gilde bij NS, waar teams in zitten die zich bezighouden met het oplossen van complexe (business)vraagstukken met behulp van Machine Learning en AI. Op deze onderwerpen leren we als teams weer van elkaar

**Dit zijn de eisen**

Samen met klanten, leden en partners zet de Rabobank zich in voor een sterkere leefomgeving en voor de grote maatschappelijke uitdagingen van nu, met als uitgangspunt dat er samen meer bereikt wordt dan alleen.

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

As a data platform engineer, you will be working on our data platform named Thor. With Thor, we want to create a self-service, metadata driven data platform where data producers can share their data with the data consumers without the platform team being the bottleneck. This means that we are working hard to enable our users so they can do as much as possible themselves and we can focus on improving and optimizing our pipelines and codebase.

 **A few cool new features we have recently implemented:**

* Smart Scheduling that dynamically changes data pipeline configuration based on historical statistics
* A versioned data platform that allows the product to scale to other brands
* Documentation that writes itself


If you want to know more about how it is to work in this team, read: https://werk.ah.nl/colleagues/charlotte-van-der-scheun/

* You optimize performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency of data pipelines and analytics workloads on Databricks
* You enable data producers with self-service capabilities on our data platform granting them the freedom to autonomously share their data to the rest of the organization for data driven insights
* You stay informed latest developments on technologies and industry trends, and evaluate their potential impact on our data platform strategy

 **Your new team and office.**

Our teams work in a hybrid way: both from home as well as in the office. We are located right next to the train station of Zaandam.

For this job we are preferably looking for someone who brings diversity to our team, in the widest possible sense. Someone who is a great addition to our team by bringing other ideas to the table.

* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee

Albert Heijn goes way back. More than 135 years, to be exact. So for millions of people, food shopping is synonymous with the Albert Heijn brand.

Translational research leverages real-world data sets to study how patients respond to cancer treatments. This research often involves integrating complex and non-standardized molecular and clinical data. Clinical datasets, designed to answer specific scientific questions, typically lack detailed data granularity, making exploration challenging. Understanding the clinical data model is crucial to selecting the appropriate variables for analysis.
This project proposes the use of graph databases to overcome these challenges by organizing data into a flexible, multidimensional structure that facilitates easier access and more intuitive querying. Graph databases, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, allow for the discovery of implicit relationships within the data that traditional table-based databases might miss. Through this initiative, we aim to develop and evaluate AI-driven querying techniques using natural language, enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets in translational research.
Responsibilities* Technology Exploration: Investigate various graph database technologies and their applicability to managing clinical data, assessing their strengths and limitations in this domain.
* Data Model Comparison: Compare and analyze the data structures of graph and relational databases to identify the most effective frameworks for clinical data.
* Pilot Database Development: Design and implement a prototype database focused on the standardization of clinical real-world data, ensuring it supports robust data integration and access.
* Natural Language Query Development: Create methods to enable querying of graph databases using natural language, employing advanced AI technologies to facilitate intuitive data interactions.
* Findings Presentation: Regularly present progress and insights during team meetings, ensuring clear communication of developments and challenges.
* Bonus Objective: Develop a user interface that enables easy querying, and effective visualization and presentation of results from the database.


Requirements* Education: You are a BSc/MSc student in bioinformatics, computational biology or a related field.
* Technical skills: Demonstrated strong technical skills, with substantial experience in Python programming. Familiarity with AWS is an added advantage.
* Soft skills: Comfortable with pioneering research and creative processes; scientific thinking and connecting that to technical requirements.


About You* You are passionate about our purpose and genuinely care about our mission to transform the lives of patients through innovative cancer treatment
* You bring rigor and excellence to all that you do. You are a fierce believer in our rooted-in-science approach to problem-solving
* You are a generous collaborator who can work in teams with diverse backgrounds
* You are determined to do and be your best and take pride in enabling the best work of others on the team

The Rainforest Alliance is creating a more sustainable world by using social and market forces to protect nature and improve the lives of farmers and forest communities. To achieve our mission, we partner with diverse allies around the world to drive positive change across global supply chains and in many of our most critically important natural landscapes.  

  

Our alliance spans 70 countries and includes farmers and forest communities, companies, governments, civil society, and millions of individuals. Together we work to protect forests and biodiversity, take action on climate, and promote the rights and improve the livelihoods of rural people.  

  

As an international nonprofit organization with more than 30 years of experience in sustainability transformation, we understand that the social and economic well-being of rural communities is tightly connected to ecosystem health. This knowledge has shaped our rigorous programs to advance sustainable land-use and commodity production.

The enormity of the social and environmental challenges we are facing requires working together in a broad alliance. This is why we bring farmers, forest communities, companies, and consumers together to change the way the world produces, sources, and consumes.  

  

**Why**  

To protect nature and improve lives it’s becoming increasingly urgent that we approach the way we use our land and produce food and other products in more sustainable ways. For this to succeed we need to fundamentally change the way that businesses operate and source, and the choices we all make as consumers.  

  

**How**  

Our growing global alliance aims to transform our relationship with our natural resources and each other, to create a better future for people and nature together.

**Postdoc on the subject of Trustworthy Human-AI Interaction for Media and Democracy (m/f/x)**


We are looking for a talented postdoc who is interested in trustworthy and transparent human-AI interactions, in the context of news media and journalism.


A 2-year fixed-term full time Postdoc position is available at the Distributed & Interactive Systems (DIS) research group at CWI. This project is a collaboration between CWI and the AI, Media, and Democracy (AIMD) lab in Amsterdam. You will be working under the supervision of Dr. Abdallah El Ali and Prof.dr. Pablo Cesar, where you will be embedded within the AIMD lab.


**Job description**
-------------------


The AI, Media and Democracy (AIMD) ELSA Lab’s aim is to set up an experimental space and testbed for novel ways of applying AI in the media. Journalists, media professionals, designers, citizens, researchers and public and societal partners bring in their challenges in using AI in the media. The lab investigates how AI-driven applications in the media change the public sphere, civic engagement and economic competition, and explores novel ways of applying AI in the media. The Distributed & Interactive Systems (DIS) research group at CWI combines data science with a strong human-centric, empirical approach to understand the experience of users. This enables us to design and develop next generation intelligent and empathic systems. We base our results on realistic testing grounds and data sets, and embrace areas such as ubiquitous and affective computing, human-centered multimedia systems, and human-AI interaction.


Encounters with AI-generated content can impact the human experience of algorithms, and more broadly the psychology of Human–AI interaction. In particular, AI system disclosures can influence users’ perceptions of media content. There is a growing concern that as generative AI becomes more widely used, manipulated content could easily spread false information. As a key step toward mitigating harms and risk, a key recent mitigation effort involves the European Al Act Proposition “Transparency Obligations for Providers and Users of Certain AI Systems and GPAI Models”, which seeks to address the issue of AI system transparency.


The research scope broadly addresses the effective, trustworthy, and transparent communication of AI system disclosures. We aim to account for ethical and legal considerations, design and human factors perspectives, as well as policy recommendations. As such, this role may involve relevant stakeholders where necessary, ranging from media organizations, policy makers, as well as AI researchers and practitioners. The initial focus is on the end-user (media consumer) perspective, and at later stages, on the perspective of the media organizations and the generative AI media production process itself. For this postdoc, we are specifically interested in how trust in AI systems can be garnered by focusing on creating better user interfaces and/or understanding human-AI system interactions at a cognitive, behavioral, and physiological level. By establishing user-centric designs for transparent AI disclosures, we can take steps toward ensuring a well-functioning democratic society.


We expect the postdoc researcher to be embedded within the AI, Media, and Democracy lab, which is located in Amsterdam’s city center.


**Topics of interest include:**


* Intelligent visualization techniques, adaptive user interfaces (UI), and content personalization, that allows tailoring users’ experience of the UI and media content as well as any associated disclosures and/or explanations
* User behavioral and physiological sensing techniques for human-AI interaction, that can help predict the right balance between information overload and the essential information to be communicated to users to build user trust in systems employing generative AI
* Developing and evaluating novel user interfaces for journalism that incorporate meaningful disclosure mechanisms for generative AI, from news production to audience engagement, to ensure user agency and autonomy
* Designing and evaluating explainability interfaces for journalists and editors working with AI to ensure responsible decision making
* Empirical studies (online and/or lab-based) to understand the relationship between AI disclosures and how people perceived AI content, for both users and media organization

**Requirements**
----------------


Depending on the specific topic of interest, candidates are required to have completed their PhD in computer science, human-computer interaction, industrial design, cognitive science, or a related field. We specifically seek candidates with a strong interest in physiological sensing and signal processing, information visualization, and/or human-centered AI. Ideally, the candidate has worked already on topics related to the social, ethical, or information presentation aspects of AI in the media sector. Candidates are expected to have publications in top HCI venues such as CHI, CSCW, UbiComp / ISWC, IEEE Vis, FAccT, IUI, or related venues.


Needed qualifications for candidates include proven research talent, strong technical background, and good academic writing and presentation skills. Candidates are expected to have an excellent command of English.


**Terms and conditions**
------------------------


The terms of employment are in accordance with the Dutch Collective Labour Agreement for Research Centres (""CAO-onderzoeksinstellingen""). The gross monthly salary for an employee on a full time basis, depending on relevant work experience, ranges from € 4.218 to € 5.141. The appointment will be for a period of two years.


Employees are also entitled to a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year-end bonus of 8.33%. CWI offers attractive working conditions, including flexible scheduling.

**That’s why we love them!**

  


Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

  

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.


Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

  

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  

Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.



In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

  

**The role in 6 bullets**

  

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

 **Your track record mentions**

  

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

  


**Why join Orbisk?**



For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

  

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

De adviezen geef je op drie ‘snelheden’: live, in dag- en weekrapporten en in grotere analyses.

Both of these young mavericks came together with their shared experiences to create Job Squad, a personal recruitment agency with a corporate twist. Job Squad’s vision was to create career opportunities for Europeans across borders, that will strengthen and develop their personality and career diversity. By breaking down borders and bringing on a wide variety of clients and positions we try to make sure there’s a position and dream destination for everyone.


At Job Squad we like to think of ourselves as professionals without the formality - after all, we are here to help and make sure both job hunt and relocation are as seamless and supportive as possible. Furthermore, we are a big multinational team, living and working in many different countries, but working closely both in and between teams! An internship at Job Squad means that you will become an essential part of the team, and you will have tasks and responsibilities and we expect you to be proactive.
