Are you fascinated by sustainability issues and do you have experience and affinity with researching the effects of land use on climate? Then we are looking for you!***  

  

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research into monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).  

  

While the team’s main focus is on forests we also conduct research into the role of land use and forest management in greenhouse gas emissions and removals in a broader context involving the whole LULUCF sector, including other land uses. Team members are responsible for the compilation of the national greenhouse gas inventory for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. For this we develop and work with geographically explicit instruments (such as models and monitoring) that can be used to determine the effects of the management or change in land use of forests, cropland, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other land. We closely collaborate with other experts on land use and soil at Wageningen Environmental Research and external research institutes to bring together all required information for the LULUCF monitoring.  

  

We use our knowledge and tools to draw up the international (Climate Convention, Paris Agreement, EU) and national (Climate and Energy Outlook) reports of greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. With our science-based expertise we also support the development and evaluation of climate policy of the Dutch government and European Commission. For instance, we currently support the European Commission in drafting the methodologies for certification of carbon removals in forests, wetlands and agricultural soils (carbon farming).  

  

**Your duties and responsibilities:**  

As LULUCF researcher you will contribute to further improving our methodologies for calculating carbon stock changes towards higher Tier levels according to the IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. This will involve the compilation and collection of new emission factors for carbon stock changes in living biomass, dead organic matter or soils and/or emissions of methane or nitrous oxide due to land use or land use change.  

  

Depending on your expertise you will be responsible for the improvements for several land use categories covered by the LULUCF sector and/or the further development of spatially explicit approaches. You also contribute to the acquisition of new externally funded projects.  

  

**You will work here**  

You will be placed in the team SFE of WENR, based at the Wageningen Campus of Wageningen University and Research, but you will also collaborate intensively with colleagues in other teams at WENR as well as with researchers in other research institutes in the Netherlands and internationally.  

  

You will be working in an enthusiastic team of about 24 colleagues working on options for conservation, restoration, development and sustainable use of trees and forests from an ecological perspective. We focus on the way in which policy, management and climate affect ecological processes and what their consequences are for climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and restoration, delivery of ecosystem services and other specific policy goals.  

  

The team offers a stimulating working environment combining first class expertise and young enthusiasm! To get a taste of the team read this post!

Additionally, a contract for 32 hours can be discussed. You will initially receive a one-year contract, which can be extended further if there is mutual enthusiasm.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!

Join us on our journey as Splunk Solution Engineer, and enjoy a culture of inclusiveness, disruption, and fun while selling smart and winning big.
What’s the role of a Solution Engineer at Splunk?* You will technically own, discover, position, prove and deliver the key technical elements of a sales cycle to achieve a ‘technical win’ within large scale and complex customer environments. You’ll use a range of communication styles, a range of technology skills and experiences and a range of soft skills and people skills to develop trust relationships with both your sales colleagues and your customers.
* You will be an advocate and ambassador for Splunk through your professional social media, industry and marketing events and supporting pipeline generation activities
* You will collaborate with your customer contacts, and build them into Splunk champions, by helping them to understand how Splunk can help them to solve some of their most challenging problems and help them achieve their objectives.


Responsibilities:* Ability to demonstrate Splunk products and services to customers on site, remotely via webinar sessions, and at field events such as conferences and trade shows.
* Establish and maintain strong relationships throughout the sales cycle with all levels within the customer.

* Technically Astute: You enjoy the detail, even if you don’t always need to express it. You have a thirst for up-to-date knowledge of the technologies and solutions that businesses use to be successful as they transform.
* Confidence: But not arrogant – you have the confidence that comes from the knowledge that your product is rock solid, and the ability to transmit this confidence to a customer. That means you might sit down with a customer already using your product to show them how they might use it even better!
* Business Savvy: You understand how businesses are organized, how they achieve their desired results, what challenges they are likely to face, what solutions they need and what transformations they could make with your solutions.
* A growth mindset: You build in time to develop your skills, knowledge, experience or capabilities. You look beyond the current opportunity towards the wider set of opportunities that could exist in a prospect.
* A Collaborator: You understand that selling is a team game, so you spend time developing your network of colleagues and partners to achieve your success – and theirs.
* Competitive: If you’re in it, you want to win it!
* Fun: Getting the job done and enjoying & generating fun don’t need to be mutually exclusive.
* The candidate must be based in the Netherlands and be fluent in Dutch and English.


Helpful technical skills or experience (not all required, but consider how Splunk could benefit from your background)* Domain knowledge and experience in any of the following areas: IT infrastructure, Cloud Technologies, Application Delivery, Business Analytics or Log Management

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!

GCA is a leading international organization dedicated to addressing climate change and promoting adaptation action for resilient development. We collaborate with governments, International Financial Institutions (IFIs), businesses, and communities to develop and implement innovative solutions that strengthen resilience and support adaptation to climate change impacts.

GCA’s strategy in Africa is implemented under the flagship Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP), launched by GCA and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to scale up adaptation efforts and mobilize finance for climate-resilient development in Africa. To date, GCA has integrated adaptation solutions into $9 billion worth of investments funded by IFIs across Africa. GCA’s work under the AAAP focuses on four pillars where investments in adaptation and resilience building can yield high economic dividends for African nations, including: Food security; Infrastructure and Nature-based Solutions; Youth entrepreneurship and adaptation jobs; and Adaptation finance.

You will delve into the critical linkages between infrastructure disruption and broader societal dimensions such as food security, livelihoods, and overall wellbeing.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.

* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Then this is a great opportunity to join our team and help us to further****develop our forest research and forest resources models like EFISCEN-Space!**  

  

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research and modelling of European forest resources.  

  

An important element of our work is the development and application of European forest simulation models like EFISCEN-Space Such models aim to understand and visualize the role that European forests play for biodiversity, climate, soil, renewable resources and the environment, and how Climate-Smart Forest management can contribute to optimize this role. With these models, we help managers and various authorities (local, regional, national and EU) to evaluate and further shape European forest and climate policies.  

  

You will be responsible for the implementation and management support of current projects including the communication with EU project partners. This will be done in consultation with the project leader, and you will replace the project leader when needed in project related matters. You will actively engage in acquisition of new projects and develop yourself into an independent project leader. Together with the team you will further develop and refine various functionalities of the simulation models (e.g. forest management, harvest costs & revenues, biodiversity, soil carbon) and apply them in the projects.  

Besides this, you will also orientate yourself on developments in related (forest) ecological and forest management or monitoring disciplines. In the team and within projects, you contribute to model development, research, improving and interpreting research results together with other (senior) researchers and project leaders. You will also contribute to the acquisition of externally funded scientific research on Dutch and European forests in the context of (climate) policy and management studies. Depending on your level of experience also supervision of more junior researchers will be part of your work.  

  

Examples of projects we work in are: TRANSFORMIT, WILDCARD, MoniFun, SUPERB and Holisoils. Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:* working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;
* the option to accrue additional compensation hours by working more;
* sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
* there is a strong focus on vitality and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
* a fixed December bonus of 8,3%;
* excellent pension scheme.


In addition to these first-rate employee benefits, you will of course receive a good salary. We offer, depending on your experience, a competitive gross salary of between €3088 and € 6522 for a full-time working week of 36 hours, in accordance with the CLA Wageningen Research (scale 10-12). Additionally, a contract for 32 hours can be discussed. You will initially receive a one-year contract, which under unchanged market conditions can be extended upon in mutual enthusiasm.  

  

Wageningen University & Research encourages internal advancement opportunities and mobility with an internal recruitment policy. There are plenty of options for personal initiative in a learning environment, and we provide excellent training opportunities. We are offering a multi-faceted position in an international environment with a pleasant and open working atmosphere.

Join ReBioClim, a Project Aiming to Pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in Four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.
* Ability to work independently and in a result-oriented way.
* Availability to start in January 2025.


Nice-to-haves:


* Experience in conducting geospatial analysis in a programming environment such as R or Python.
* Knowledge of co-design workshop methodologies.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

Then we invite you to consider our offer.

  



**Job Description**  

In the plastic packaging value chain, there is only limited information available on the plastics in that chain to assess circularity and recyclability goals, especially the use of post-consumer recyclates (PCR) in packaging.

  


Quality specifications, monitoring, and standardisation of materials are common in certain industries like chemistry and pharma but are, at this point, only in an infancy state in plastic waste management. A major challenge when it comes to mechanical recycling of plastics is that the quality of the material is not monitored throughout the whole process. Inline monitoring is however essential for predicting the final quality of PCR.

  


In the MoQuP-R project, we focus on the necessary quality monitoring tools and the application of existing models related to the prediction of recyclate quality in order to increase the use of PCR in packaging. In this project, your responsibilities will entail:


* Review literature to identify relevant quality parameters in mechanical recycling of plastics.
* Support the adaptation of laboratory and/or offline analytical techniques to be used inline in polymer processing equipment.
* Support the realisation of changes to polymer processing equipment to enable inline measurements during extrusion.
* Develop a new inline rheometer aiming to identify fluctuations in the properties of the material during recycling.
* Design and perform experiments using polymer processing equipment and post-consumer plastics to apply and develop monitoring tools.
* Analyse the experimental data from the experiments related to PCR quality and propose predictive models.
* Present your work at international conferences, MoQuP-R consortium meetings, and other events and write scientific papers for international peer-reviewed journals.
* Provide teaching assistance and/or supervision of students.

  




As a PhD Candidate, you will work in the Circular Plastics team in the Faculty of Science and Engineering located at Brightlands Chemelot Campus in Geleen. You will become part of a young international research group, specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics with a strong polymer science background. You will be guided by Rudinei Fiorio and supported by other experts in the Circular Plastics team on this exciting topic.

  


**Requirements**  

We expect you to have the following experience, knowledge, and skills:


* A MSc degree in mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, polymer science, chemical engineering, chemistry, or similar;
* Good knowledge on analytical techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, GCMS;
* Skills in polymer processing;
* Good skills in data analysis software (e.g. Python (preferred), Matlab, Simulink);
* Proficiency in both written and spoken English.

  




**What we offer**  

**As a PhD candidate at the** **Faculty of Science & Engineering****, you will be employed by the most international university in the Netherlands, located in the beautiful city of Maastricht. In addition, we offer you:**


* Good employment conditions.

In addition to the monthly salary, an 8.0% holiday allowance and an 8.3% year-end bonus apply.
* An employment contract for a period of 12 months with a scope of 1.0 FTE. Upon a positive evaluation, an extension of 3 years will follow.
* At Maastricht University, the well-being of our employees is of utmost importance, we offer flexible working hours and the possibility to work partly from home if the nature of your position allows it. You will receive a monthly commuting and internet allowance for this. If you work full-time, you will be entitled to 29 vacation days and 4 additional public holidays per year, namely carnival Monday, carnival Tuesday, Good Friday, and Liberation Day. If you choose to accumulate compensation hours, an additional 12 days will be added. Furthermore, you can personalize your employment conditions through a collective labor agreement (CAO) choice model.
* As Maastricht University, we offer various other excellent secondary employment conditions. These include a good pension scheme with the ABP and the opportunity for UM employees to participate in company fitness and make use of the extensive sports facilities that we also offer to our students.

***Explore groundbreaking PFAS removal using foam in wastewater treatment. Join TU Delft's PhD project and shape future environmental solutions.***


Job description


Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a diverse group of compounds that have become widespread pollutants in the (aqueous) environment. To prevent further PFAS contamination, the development of cost- and energy-efficient treatment technologies for contaminated waters is crucial.



PFAS, particularly the group of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA), are often surface-active molecules that can be removed from water by adsorption to air bubbles and subsequent accumulation in foam, which is exploited in a technology called foam fractionation. However, the foam fractionation process is still relatively energy-intensive and expensive, due to the need for high aeration rates.



This PhD project aims to investigate whether PFAS removal with foam can be integrated into existing wastewater treatment technologies, particularly the activated sludge (AS) process. Aeration is an integral part of AS treatment, and foam formation is often observed when PFAS-contaminated water types are treated. However, the three-phase nature of the foam/sludge process complicates our understanding of the system, and incorporating physicochemical removal of PFAS may negatively affect the biological nutrient removal in the reactor.



This project will combine lab experiments assessing the impact of various process variables on the removal of PFAS and nutrients in a combined system, with full scale monitoring of an existing AS plant where foam removal will be implemented. The project may also include investigations of destructive technologies for handling the PFAS-enriched foam.


Requirements


As a good candidate, you will have the following 'Need-to-haves':


* MSc in Chemical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Water Technology, or a closely related field

* Laboratory experience proven by lab courses, internships or other previous work
* Excellent spoken and written English; English Proficiency Test IELTS of 7.0 (scores of at least 6.5 in all sections) or TOEFL of 100 (scores of at least 2.1 for all sections).


and hopefully the following 'Nice-to-haves':


* Experience in design and/or operation of lab-scale reactors proven by previous practical or research projects
* Experience in analytical chemistry, specifically LC-MS/MS or LC-HRMS
* R, Python, Matlab, or equivalent programming skills


Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis.

**Wie zoeken wij?**

Voor ons hoofdkantoor in Amersfoort zoeken wij per direct een AI Solutions Developer.

In deze rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verkennen en implementeren van de mogelijkheden van generative AI, zoals ChatGPT, om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren.

Je hebt een relevante WO-opleiding afgerond of bijna afgerond, zoals Informatica of Data Science, en beschikt over aantoonbare kennis en interesse op het gebied van AI, machine learning en data-analyse.

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

* Voorbereiding van een breed scala aan financiële rapporten/datarapporten voor jouw toegewezen investeringen. Sommige rapporten worden naar belanghebbenden gestuurd om hen te ondersteunen bij hun besluitvormingsproces. Andere rapporten zijn vereist door financiële regelgeving en zullen beschikbaar zijn voor het bredere publiek. Alle rapporten moeten daarom van hoge kwaliteit zijn;
* Samenwerking met interne belanghebbenden (externe beleggingsbeheerders, portfolio managers van Front Office, tweedelijns kwaliteitscontroleafdelingen, Accounting en Controle, Cash Management) om tijdig alle benodigde informatie te verzamelen, zodat je investeringen tijdig kunt opzetten in onze systemen en kunt starten met de uitvoering, registratie van transacties en rapportage;
* Uitvoeren van analyses/conciliaties op investeringswaarden ontvangen van externe beleggingsbeheerders;
* Assisteren van de Officers in het team met analyse/databijeenkomst voor Continuous Improvement Projects die door hen worden geleid. Geleidelijke betrokkenheid bij initiatieven voor procesverbeteringen.

* Je bent voortdurend op zoek naar manieren om processen te verbeteren en weet hoe je je collega's hierbij kunt betrekken.
* Je werkt gestructureerd, hebt oog voor detail (werkt nauwgezet) en kunt daardoor meerdere gebeurtenissen tegelijkertijd behandelen/bewaken.
* Je volgt acties zoals beschreven, rondt zaken af en benadert actief andere mensen/afdelingen wanneer dat nodig is om je taken af te ronden.
* Je beschouwt jezelf als iemand die kan omgaan met veranderingen (veranderingen in processen, werklast, enz.) en je beschouwt jezelf als een goed georganiseerd persoon.
* Goede communicatieve vaardigheden in het Engels (gesproken en geschreven). Nederlandse taalvaardigheid wordt beschouwd als een pluspunt.
* Je kunt effectief feedback ontvangen en erop reageren.
* Locatie: Heerlen. Mogelijkheid tot deels thuiswerken.

Over de afdeling
  
  

De Academie Educatie is één van de 14 academies binnen de HAN. Bijna 5.000 studenten volgen bij de academie een vol- of deeltijdopleiding op bachelor-, associate of masterniveau. Ook zijn we een belangrijke kennispartner in de regio Arnhem en Nijmegen voor ons werkveld. Scholen, schoolbesturen en educatieve instellingen zijn onze partners in de regio met wie we samen opleiden, onderzoeken, kwalificeren en professionaliseren.
  
  

De Academie Educatie heeft vier lectoraten die praktijkgericht onderzoek doen op de volgende onderzoeksthema’s: Leren met ict, Responsief beroepsonderwijs, Meervoudige professionaliteit van leraren, en Eigentijds beoordelen en beslissen.
  
  

Het lectoraat Leren met ict bij de Academie Educatie van de HAN, is de centrale kennispartner in het iXperium Centre of Expertise Leren met ict (iXperium), een netwerkorganisatie van lectoraat, lerarenopleidingen, primair en voortgezet onderwijs, mbo en hbo. Het kernteam bestaat uit ongeveer 20 personen; een lector en twee associate lectoren, een programmamanager, (senior) onderzoekers, projectleiders, ict-specialisten en projectondersteuners. De thuisbasis van het kernteam is de HAN Campus in Nijmegen, maar werkzaamheden vinden ook plaats op de HAN campus in Arnhem en uiteraard ook in het onderwijswerkveld.
  
  

In het iXperium werken onderzoekers, leraren, lerarenopleiders, ict-experts, studenten en andere professionals uit het onderwijs samen aan evidence informed praktijkontwikkeling. De gezamenlijke, richtinggevende visie luidt: ‘leren is een leven lang gepersonaliseerd leren in een door technologie ondersteunde, sociale, leeromgeving’. Het onderzoeksprogramma kent drie programmalijnen:
  
  

gepersonaliseerd leren met ict;
  
de organisatie van gepersonaliseerd leren met ict op micro-, meso- en macroniveau;
  
opleiden in ict-geletterdheid voor leren, leven en werken.

Je zal vanaf het begin van je carrière als docent worden uitgedaagd en gefaciliteerd om jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen wat betreft je vakkennis en je didactische vaardigheden. De wereld waarin we ons bewegen ontwikkelt continu en jij als docent groeit en leert mee!


De opleiding


De opleiding Applied Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (ADS&AI) is voor studenten die begrijpen dat, naast technische en niet-technische competenties, de ontwikkelde AI oplossingen ook een verantwoordelijkheid met zich meebrengen (responsible AI).


We staan als opleiding voor een open en respectvolle leeromgeving en vinden het belangrijk dat onze studenten met plezier en vertrouwen hun studie volgen. Er is gekozen voor een geïntegreerd onderwijsconcept waarbij de ontwikkelingsgerichtheid van de student centraal staat. Dat betekent dat de student gericht wordt opgeleid aan de hand van onze zes competenties (responsible technology, drie technische competenties en twee professionele competenties). Studenten ontvangen regelmatig feedback en mogen fouten maken. Vertrouwen opbouwen in hun eigen kunnen is iets wat we de studenten mee willen geven.


We leren studenten om oplossingen en toepassingen voor uiteenlopende stakeholders te onderzoeken, te ontwerpen en te bouwen. De studenten worden niet alleen technisch goed onderlegd, ze leren ook te adviseren en communiceren over inzichten en oplossingen. Het onderwijs richt zich voornamelijk op projecten waarbij we zo dicht mogelijk de praktijk proberen te benaderen. Dit doen we in het 1e studiejaar aan de hand van vier thema’s: data driven society, smart & social city, data driven logistics en data supported healthcare. Er wordt vooral met echte opdrachtgevers gewerkt.

**Your job**
------------


How the overturning circulation of the Mediterranean Sea responds to variations in forcing (tectonics and climate) is a fundamental question that potentially has global significance given that Mediterranean circulation has elements in common with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. It is also a highly relevant question for the countries bordering the sea in view of our warming climate.


In this NWO (Dutch Research Council)-funded project we will exploit the paleoceanographical record of the late Quaternary which provides an exceptional dataset on e.g. water properties, intensity of intermediate and deep-water formation and strait flow. You will design and execute experiments with dynamic box models and evaluate their results using the available data. The geometrically simple box model is chosen because it can be run following the evolution of circulation and water properties through time, thus doing justice to the transient nature of the processes at play. The analysis will focus on the role of:


* the Strait of Sicily;
* the properties of the inflowing waters; and
* sea-level variation.


You will be based at the department of Earth Sciences where you will be part of a vibrant PhD community and where expertise in both paleoceanography/paleoclimate and numerical modelling is amply available.


A personalised training programme will be set up, reflecting your training needs and career objectives. About 20% of your time will be dedicated to this training component, which includes training on the job in assisting in the Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes of the department.


**Your qualities**
------------------


You must have completed your MSc degree in Earth Sciences, Physical Oceanography, or a related discipline by the time the position starts. We seek candidates that have a keen interest in working on the interface between marine geology and physical oceanography. The ideal candidate:


* has knowledge of and experience with numerical modelling applied to Earth’s processes, using programming languages such as Python, MATLAB or R;
* has a solid basis in physics - specific knowledge regarding physical oceanography or (geophysical) fluid mechanics is an asset;
* is trained in the concepts of sedimentary geology required for this project: aspects of sedimentology, stratigraphy and paleoceanography;
* is willing and able to interact with specialists in the various disciplines that come together in this project.


Due to the international character of our department, good command of spoken and written English is essential. We highly encourage applicants from all members of our community and of diverse backgrounds to join us.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for one year, with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period;
* a working week of 38 hours and a gross monthly salary between €2,770 and €3,539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.

Then this is a great opportunity to join our team and help us to further develop our forest research and forest resources models like EFISCEN-Space!**  

  

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research and modelling of European forest resources.  

  

An important element of our work is the development and application of European forest simulation models like EFISCEN-Space Such models aim to understand and visualize the role that European forests play for biodiversity, climate, soil, renewable resources and the environment, and how Climate-Smart Forest management can contribute to optimize this role. With these models, we help managers and various authorities (local, regional, national and EU) to evaluate and further shape European forest and climate policies.  

  

You will be responsible for the implementation and management support of current projects including the communication with EU project partners. This will be done in consultation with the project leader, and you will replace the project leader when needed in project related matters. You will actively engage in acquisition of new projects and develop yourself into an independent project leader. Together with the team you will further develop and refine various functionalities of the simulation models (e.g. forest management, harvest costs & revenues, biodiversity, soil carbon) and apply them in the projects.  

  

Besides this, you will also orientate yourself on developments in related (forest) ecological and forest management or monitoring disciplines. In the team and within projects, you contribute to model development, research, improving and interpreting research results together with other (senior) researchers and project leaders. You will also contribute to the acquisition of externally funded scientific research on Dutch and European forests in the context of (climate) policy and management studies. Depending on your level of experience also supervision of more junior researchers will be part of your work.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research are recruiting a:

 **Postdoc position Pharmacometrics for anti-infective pharmacology and pandemic preparedness (2 positions available)**  

**Vacancy number: 15017**


The Division of Systems Pharmacology and Pharmacy (SPP) of the Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR) aims to develop quantitative precision medicine approaches to predict variation in treatment response and enhance translational drug development strategies. Our ambition is to impact development of personalized treatment strategies and innovative translational drug development through integration with clinical data, including patient data. We develop new methodological advances at the interface of quantitative systems- and clinical pharmacology/pharmacometrics and other disciplines such as innovative experimental disease models, emerging biomarker technologies, state-of-the art biophysical tools, and advanced statistical/ ML/ AI-approaches.

**Project description**  

We have two postdoc positions available within the ZonMW-funded project “PPP-COMPUTE: A Pandemic Pharmacology Platform for model-based optimization of anti-infectives”.


In PPP-COMPUTE we aim to establish a versatile computational platform to facilitate early clinical development of novel anti-infective treatments, with a focus on viral and bacterial pathogens, to support efficient pandemic drug development activities. During a pandemic there exists a need for rapid evaluation of potential therapeutic modalities. Tools to rapidly predict treatment strategies and optimize the design of clinical trials for novel anti-infectives agents against emerging pathogens are therefore essential. The ability to generate such clinical predictions relies on effective integration of data concerning the relationship between (expected) concentrations of the therapeutic agent (pharmacokinetics, PK) in patients and the associated effects on pathogen clearance (pharmacodynamics, PD).


The PPP-COMPUTE platform will consist of several integrated computational pharmacological mechanism-based PK/PD models to rapidly evaluate and predict optimal (combination) treatment strategies (e.g., dosing schedules) and clinical trial designs for potential therapeutic agents, building on established models, and experimental and clinical data already available in the public domain. The framework will be implemented as a public web-application. PPP-COMPUTE will involve clinical stakeholders through collaborating with the recently established INFECT-NL consortium, which aims to establish key infrastructure for early clinical trials of anti-infectives. Finally, the developed modeling framework may be integrated with epidemiological mathematical models which study the effect of novel therapeutic interventions on pathogen transmission dynamics on a population level.


For the available two postdoc positions, we are ideally seeking one individual with a strong track record in pharmacometric and ideally mechanism-based modeling, while for the second position we seek a candidate with a rack record in development of web-applications (R/Shiny) and handling large scale data, in addition to knowledge of pharmacometric/PKPD modeling.

**Key responsibilities**

* Conduct original research in the area of translational pharmacology of anti-infectives in the context of pandemic preparedness;
* Develop and implement mechanism-based and population PK/PD based mathematical models for anti-infectives to support translation between preclinical and clinical data of anti-infective agents;
* Develop a user-friendly web-applications (R/Shiny) which implement the developed models;
* Engage in collaborative research within the project;
* Publish scientific articles at international peer-review journals;
* Presentation of results internally and at (inter-) national conferences;
* Possible support of education activities in the bachelor and master programs of biopharmaceutical sciences.

**Selection Criteria**

* PhD degree in the area of quantitative pharmacology, pharmacometrics or systems pharmacology, or a related (quantitative) discipline;
* Strong experience with modelling approaches in pharmacometrics and/or systems pharmacology applied to clinical and/or preclinical data;
* Experience in R programming and modelling software tools such as NONMEM, Monolix, or nlmixr;
* Experience with viral dynamic modelling is desirable;
* Knowledge of anti-infectives and infectious diseases;
* Strong communication and writing skills;
* Ability to work independently as well as part of a team;
* Excellent organisational and planning skills;
* Full proficiency in English;
* Enthusiastic, highly motivated, and independent thinker.

Join ReBioClim, a project aiming to pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.
* Ability to work independently and in a result-oriented way.
* Availability to start in January 2025.


Nice-to-haves:


* Experience in conducting geospatial analysis in a programming environment such as R or Python.
* Knowledge of co-design workshop methodologies.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

Werkplezier en je ontwikkeling staan daarin centraal. We vinden diversiteit belangrijk. Verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en inzichten zorgen ervoor dat we beter aansluiten bij de behoeften uit de samenleving.  

  

Afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur  

De nieuwe afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur levert een bijdrage aan de uitvoering van de missie en visie van de directie D&B, onder meer door de informatiepositie van het decentraal bestuur op complexe opgaven te vergroten en op projectmatige wijze (uitvoerings)beleid en werkvormen te ontwikkelen die goed verbonden zijn met de praktijk van het decentraal bestuur. Op korte termijn is de opgave van de afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur om de methodiek van Zicht op Ondermijning structureel te borgen. De afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur is verantwoordelijk voor de kwaliteit van de 'Zicht op-methode' en het organiseren, uitbreiden en onderhouden van het brede samenwerkingsverband en het maken van afspraken met interne en externe netwerkpartners.  

Om de meerwaarde van de 'Zicht-op methode' voor bredere inzet binnen het decentraal bestuur te vergroten werkt de afdeling Ondersteuning Bestuur aan bewustwording rond (ondermijnings)risico's; versterking van de informatiepositie van decentraal bestuur (o.a. via de Zicht-op methode); het aanreiken van handelingsperspectief; het ontwikkelen van een kennis en leernetwerk en expertpool; ontwikkeling van monitoring en rapportage en onderzoek ten behoeve van de bestuurlijk-preventieve aanpak vanuit het decentraal bestuur.



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.

-------------------


  
Binnen het ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties zorgt de afdeling Beleidsinformatie ervoor dat de vier directies binnen het DG Digitalisering en Overheidsorganisaties (DGDOO) de juiste informatie tot hun beschikking hebben om effectief beleid te voeren. De missie van onze afdeling is rijksbreed bedrijfsvoeringsbeleid datagedreven maken, met als doel op basis van feiten en cijfers sturing geven aan beleid en verantwoording afleggen aan de Tweede Kamer. Beleidsinformatie staat voor betrouwbare cijfers en producten, onmisbare en klantgerichte businesspartner in alle stadia van het besluitvormingsproces.


Als data analist binnen Beleidsinformatie vergroot je de data-, analyse- en presentatiedeskundigheid van de afdeling. Je geeft mede richting aan innovatie en je bent verantwoordelijk voor het realiseren van informatieproducten en data-oplossingen.


Vanuit een datagedreven mindset adviseer je en denk je mee over vernieuwende oplossingen en toepassingen voor concrete vragen. Jij begrijpt snel waar het om gaat en ziet onmiddellijk verbanden met andere vragen. Je benadert vraagstukken vanuit een concept en weet ze in de context te plaatsen. Zo realiseer je begrijpelijke informatieproducten en dataoplossingen op het gebied van personeelsbeleid, inkoop, huisvesting en duurzaamheid. Je weet je weg te vinden in R en gebruikt deze tool om verschillende analyses uit te voeren. Van eenvoudige databewerking en koppelingen tot een geavanceerde tekstanalyse of een automatiseringsslag, jij draait je hand er niet voor om.


Naast verstand van techniek, ga je als data analist bij Beleidsinformatie nog een stap verder. Je bent een luisteraar en doorvrager. Je maakt de vertaalslag tussen beleid en data analyse, en vice versa. Je geeft advies over datavraagstukken en je ontwikkelt nieuwe oplossingen. Je bent een vraagbaak voor je collega's.


De afdeling is volop in ontwikkeling en maakt een grote professionaliseringslag. Wij bieden een dynamische, uitdagende werkomgeving waarin ruimte is voor innovatie en professionele ontwikkeling. Je komt te werken in een warm en gedreven team.

The Faculty of Science and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) are looking for:

**PhD candidate | Environmental impact assessment of pollution at the ecosystem level (0.8-1.0 fte)**

**Vacancy number: (14994)**


**Background**


The freshwater system and its adjacent ecosystems host countless species because of their need of water. These are the earths’ natural capital and drivers of many ecosystem services we humans depend on. At the same time, the presence and effects of anthropogenic stress in the aquatic environment are multitude and ubiquitous. These include the omnipresence of chemical pollution such as the use of agricultural chemicals.


To relatively quickly assess the impacts of chemicals a standard risk assessment framework is in place. While valuable, the frameworks often lacks ecological realism. Researchers from Leiden University therefore experiment in outdoor freshwater experimental systems with natural food webs such as the “Levend Lab” (EN: “Living Lab”, https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/livinglab) to identify how biodiversity responds to the impacts of pesticides, fertilizers, invasive species and nanomaterials.


Using ecological theory, a large array of different experimental and statistical analytical methods are currently in practice to perform and analyze such experiments. The key challenge for the PhD candidate is to test these different forms of experimental and statistical analytical methods to identify stressor - ecosystem function relationships. The research will likely entail measuring different forms of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functionality followed by statistical modelling to infer causality of stressor impacts and their propagation through the ecosystem.


We invite prospective candidates to unravel the intricate network of species interactions between each other and their environment. The candidate will use new analytical methods and develops models and interpretation scenarios to identify how pollution impacts species and their role in ecosystem functionality.

**Key tasks:**

* *Perform* mesocosm pollution experiments in the ‘Levend Lab’ facility of Leiden University
* *Further develop* and test different types of statistical analyses at the community to ecosystem level
* *Advance* ecological theory by identifying the anthropological and natural drivers of species and their roles in ecosystems

**Selection criteria:**

* You should have an M.Sc. in a relevant field (environmental science, biology, ecology and/or ecotoxicology), but we also consider candidates from other related scientific fields.
* Experience with experimental field and laboratory skills and (aquatic) organism identifications are highly valued
* Strong background and interest in statistical analyses, data management, visualization and coding skills (in R, but Python also applies) is highly valued.
* You must be proficient in spoken and written English.
* You are a team player and have a collaborative attitude.


**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,800 staff and almost 6,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 150 FTE (including postdocs and PhD candidates) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

We offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 4 years based on performance. Salary ranges from € 2.770 gross per month in the first year to € 3.539 gross per month in the fourth year based on a full-time position (pay scale P in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities).


Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development and sabbatical leave. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break.


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website. Female researchers are also welcomed to join the Researchers In Science for Equality network of the Faculty if Science (rise.nu).

**De afdeling -** ***Directie Toeslagen***  

Dienst Toeslagen zorgt voor het juist, tijdig en rechtmatig toekennen en uitbetalen van de huur-, zorg- en kinderopvangtoeslag en het kindgebonden budget. Je werkzaamheden zijn gericht op verschillende vormen van interactie, gericht op de individuele behoeften, het gedrag en de omstandigheden van de burger.

 **De organisatie**  

Toeslagen  

Dienst Toeslagen is een zelfstandige, publieke dienstverlener, onderdeel van het ministerie van Financiën. We maken vitale voorzieningen als de huur, de zorgverzekering en de zorg voor kinderen voor iedereen betaalbaar. Maar als je er goed over nadenkt, gaat ons werk over veel meer dan alleen het uitkeren van een maandelijks voorschot aan mensen die daar recht op hebben. Wij zorgen ervoor dat mensen mee kunnen doen in de maatschappij. Zonder dat ze zich zorgen hoeven te maken of ze deze maand de huur, de kinderopvang of de zorgverzekering of de zorg voor hun kinderen nog kunnen betalen. Mensen helpen die ons hard nodig hebben, dat is waar we het voor doen. Door onze kennis in te zetten en -vooral- ons te blijven verplaatsen in de mensen om wie het gaat. Door hun problemen, twijfels en uitdagingen zo goed mogelijk te doorgronden.


Binnen Dienst Toeslagen heeft de Uitvoeringsorganisatie Herstel Toeslagen een specifieke, tijdelijke opdracht: gedupeerde ouders erkenning bieden en ruimhartig herstellen voor het onrecht  

dat hen is aangedaan rondom kinderopvangtoeslag.


Met elkaar en met de buitenwereld bouwen we aan Dienst Toeslagen. De motivatie om te leren van gemaakte fouten is in de hele organisatie voelbaar. Iedere dag opnieuw proberen we Dienst Toeslagen nog beter te laten aansluiten bij wat de samenleving vraagt. Zodat iedereen in Nederland, wie je ook bent en wat je persoonlijke situatie ook is, kan meedoen.

-------------------


  
Als projectleider vorm je een belangrijke schakel in de optimale samenhang tussen de inlichtingen- en bedrijfsprocessen en IT en werk je aan de voortdurende verbetering hiervan. Jij brengt vernieuwing en realiserend vermogen in een omgeving die voortdurend in beweging is. De projectleider zal worden belast met alle aspecten van de uitvoering van IV- en ICT-projecten. Dit loopt van het initiëren, definiëren, ontwerpen en voorbereiden van deze projecten, via het daadwerkelijk leiden van (complexe) projecten en het implementeren en realiseren van de plannen, tot het verzorgen van nazorg en het afsluiten van projecten. Het betreft projecten van variërende omvang.  

Je geeft op effectieve en transparante wijze leiding aan multidisciplinaire teams en houdt toezicht op werk van derden. Jouw drijfveer is om de MIVD nieuwe mogelijkheden te bieden om de dienst op kortere en middellange termijn effectiever te maken. Ook benut jij kansen die zich aandienen door technologische ontwikkelingen, bijvoorbeeld door innovatie te stimuleren. Met je solide achtergrond ben je in staat verschillende rollen te vervullen, bijvoorbeeld die van adviseur, (deel)projectleider, kwaliteitsbewaker of system integrator.  

Als persoon ben je nieuwsgierig en zoek je naar de laatste mogelijkheden in de markt en luister je naar ideeën uit de eigen organisatie. Jij weet deze op waarde te schatten en kansen te identificeren alsook de strategische en de praktische implicaties van verbeteringen duidelijk voor het voetlicht te brengen. Je treedt daarbij op als verbinder tussen de verschillende technische specialisten, de (DevOps) teams en de vertegenwoordigers van de gebruikersorganisatie. Dit alles met oog voor de uitdagingen van vandaag en de ambities van de toekomst.



Deze functie is geplaatst in onze locatie Eibergen, waar je veel samenwerkt in een groeiend team met een brede taak. Het accent ligt binnen het team op netwerk- server- en werkplek-beheer en technisch en functioneel applicatiebeheer, binnen een complexe omgeving met specifieke systemen / applicaties. Omdat het een kleinere locatie met beperkte specialistische functies betreft wordt van je verwacht dat je het geen probleem vindt om regelmatig de inhoud in te duiken, vooral in de opstartfase van een project. Je werkt daarbij onder andere samen met een analist, een informatiebeveiligings-expert en ICT-beheerders. Met de servicemanager stem je de overdracht vanuit project naar beheer af. Je onderhoudt een nauwe band met je collega-projectleiders en andere collega’s die op een andere locatie werkzaam zijn, onder andere over de werkwijze rond projecten.



We zijn het Scaled Agile Framwork (SAFe) aan het implementeren en je denkt met ons mee over de rol die de projectleider hierin in de toekomst heeft. Dit kan betekenen dat je rol er anders uit komt te zien met de jaren.


* Je bent een echte kartrekker. Je hebt aantoonbare ervaring in het aansturen van projectteams en je haalt er energie uit om met collega’s op een prettige wijze resultaat neer te zetten, met de focus op tijd en kwaliteit, en daarin de leidende rol te pakken.
* Je bent vaardig in het ontwikkelen, uitdragen en verdedigen van projectresultaten, producten en diensten;
* Je hebt kennis van zowel klassieke methoden en technieken voor projectmanagement alsmede van agile werkwijzen zoals SAFe, DevOps en AgilePM;
* Je hebt brede kennis van de bedrijfsprocessen en ICT-ontwikkelingen en -innovaties, waaronder big data ontwikkelingen;
* Je weet klantbehoeften te identificeren, gestructureerd weer te geven en deze door te vertalen naar oplossingsrichtingen;
* Je hebt ervaring met inzet van IT in operationele (defensie-) omstandigheden of hebt hier affiniteit mee;
* Je laat je niet snel uit het veld slaan en bent gewend om met veel verschillende belangen en partijen samen te werken.

-------------------


  
Zie je rioolwater ook als een bron van informatie voor de aanwezigheid van virussen zoals SARS-CoV-2 en andere ziekteverwekkers?



Wil je jouw kennis gebruiken voor het opzetten en uitvoeren van innovatief laboratoriumonderzoek voor een heel nieuw humaan surveillancesysteem op basis van rioolwater? Dan zoeken we jou om dat samen met ons verder te ontwikkelen!



Meer over het RIVM en de afdeling



Bij het RIVM werken ruim 2500 collega’s elke dag samen aan de zorg voor morgen. Het centrum Zoönosen en Omgevingsmicrobiologie, dat valt binnen het domein infectieziekten & vaccinologie, heeft tot doel om de gezondheid van Nederland op het gebied van infectieziekten te analyseren en bewaken. Op de onlangs opgerichte afdeling Nationale Rioolwater Surveillance (NRS) doen de collega’s samen met kennispartners onderzoek naar verwekkers van infectieziekten die in het rioolwater worden uitgescheiden. Hiervoor is het programma gestart voor de Nationale Rioolwater Surveillance voor SARS-CoV-2. De NRS werkt samen met internationale partners zoals de Europese commissie en het European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).



Wat ga je doen



Als onderzoeksmedewerker, met een expertise in moleculaire biologie, werk je mee aan hoogwaardig onderzoek naar o.a. SARS-CoV-2 en andere pathogenen en indicatoren in rioolwater. Je werkt in een multidisciplinair team van onderzoeksmedewerkers, onderzoekers en data-analisten/modelleurs.



Werkzaamheden en taken


* Samen met een team van onderzoeksmedewerkers moleculair onderzoek uitvoeren; detectie en typering van pathogenen in rioolwater.

* Analyseren van de onderzoeksresultaten en het eenduidig vastleggen en het borgen van de inhoudelijke kwaliteit van het onderzoek en van de laboratoriumprocessen.


Uniek aan deze baan



Nederland is een van de voorlopers in het gebruik van rioolwater op nationale schaal als humaan surveillancesysteem waarbij alle rioolwaterzuiveringsinstallaties meerdere malen per week worden bemonsterd. Vanuit de Europese commissie en ECDC wordt naar het RIVM gekeken als belangrijk voorbeeld van het zeer snel en efficiënt uitvoeren van de rioolwatersurveillance. Er wordt nauw samengewerkt met de waterschappen om dit voor het Ministerie van VWS te realiseren. Binnen het RIVM werkt de NRS samen met epidemiologen, modelleurs en virologen om de data te duiden. Het NRS team is jong en divers en bestaat uit laboratoriumanalisten, data-analisten, en onderzoekers. Het is een collegiaal en hecht team waarin je snel wordt opgenomen. Er is veel ruimte om je verder te ontwikkelen. Om rioolwatersurveillance nog meer op de kaart te zetten, zijn we op zoek naar versterking.



Informeren en solliciteren



Wil jij bijdragen aan rioolwateronderzoek ter bevordering van de volksgezondheid van Nederlanders in de functie van onderzoeksmedewerker? De functie is in eerste instantie voor één jaar. Bij gebleken geschiktheid en bij voldoende financiële ruimte binnen de afdeling bestaat mogelijkheid tot verlenging met een jaar of eventueel omzetting naar vast.

Wat is het effect van het begeleiden van statushouders op hun kans op een baan? Hoe herken je mensen die grote moeite hebben om een boete te betalen? Wat is het effect van overheidsbeleid op dakloosheid van jongeren? Dit is een greep uit de vraagstukken die wij met behulp van data beantwoorden. Zie jij jezelf hier al aan werken? Maak dan met ons het verschil!
  
  

Wat ga je doen?
  
  

Als junior onderzoeker econometrie doe je voornamelijk data-analyses, van het bewerken van data tot aan het schatten van modellen. Ook het toegankelijk rapporteren van de resultaten behoren tot jouw werkzaamheden. De data-analyses doe je altijd samen met een andere econometrist of data-analist. Hierdoor heb je altijd de mogelijkheid om te sparren en zo het beste uit de data en uit jezelf te halen. Je draait mee in een aantal verschillende projecten tegelijkertijd. Dit doe je in gemixte projectteams van collega’s met verschillende functies en achtergronden.
  
  

Voorbeeldprojecten
  
  

Het onderzoeken van het effect van het inkorten van de WW op hoe snel WW-gerechtigden vanuit de WW weer aan het werk gaan.
  
  

Het onderzoeken van het effect van een verlaagd btw-tarief op onder andere de werkgelegenheid.
  
Het onderzoeken van belemmeringen van bijstandsgerechtigden bij het delen van woonruimte. Als econometrist onderzoek je in dit geval het effect van de kostendelersnorm (lagere bijstandsuitkering als er meer volwassen personen op een adres wonen) op dakloosheid van jongeren.

Wie zijn wij?
  
  

Significant Groep is georganiseerd in de vier ventures APE, Public, Insights en Synergy. Deze ventures zijn de thuisbasis voor verschillende competenties die wij inzetten. Waarbij onderlinge samenwerking de meerwaarde is naar onze opdrachtgevers voor het beste resultaat.
  
  

Significant APE is het onderzoeksbureau binnen de Significant Groep dat gespecialiseerd is in beleidsvraagstukken in de publieke sector. Wij werken aan maatschappelijke vraagstukken in opdracht van ministeries en gemeenten. Bij ons werken leergierige en ambitieuze onderzoekers die van nature nieuwsgierig zijn, die gedreven worden door het willen weten en niet loslaten totdat ze alle informatie boven tafel hebben. Significant APE is een warme organisatie waarin wij naar elkaar omkijken en samen de schouders eronder zetten om tot het beste resultaat te komen voor en met onze opdrachtgevers. Wij ondersteunen opdrachtgevers bij de ontwikkeling van (financiële) verdeelmodellen en het uitvoeren van impactanalyses, beleidsevaluaties, effectiviteitsmetingen en geavanceerde (econometrische) analyses.
  
  

Wie ben jij?
  
Je hebt een wo-opleiding econometrie gevolgd;
  
Bij het binnenkomen van een vraag vanuit één van onze klanten ben je in staat om samen met collega’s de beste aanpak te bedenken (dit laat je zien tijdens een opdracht in het sollicitatieproces);
  
Je staat graag in contact met klanten. Het gaat dan bijvoorbeeld om het verhelderen van de vraag die de klant heeft of het presenteren van onderzoeksresultaten.
  
Wat bieden wij?
  
Werken aan projecten die er echt toe doen en daarmee de mogelijkheid om een bijdrage te leveren aan de maatschappij
  
Ruimte en ondersteuning om je op professioneel vlak verder te ontwikkelen
  
Mensgerichte organisatie waarin we naar elkaar omkijken.
  
We bieden een plezierige werksfeer waar inspanning en ontspanning goed in balans met elkaar staan. Naast de dagelijkse gezamenlijke lunch, vrijdagmiddagborrel, de zomerbarbecue en het eindejaarsevenement, organiseren collega’s ook activiteiten zoals een kaasproeverij, een Padel-toernooi of interessante uitstapjes naar organisaties binnen het werkveld (deelname is vrijblijvend!)
  
Wij streven naar een inclusieve en veilige werkomgeving waar we diversiteit omarmen en waar iedereen gelijke kansen krijgt. Wij zijn een organisatie waarbij iedereen meetelt, welkom en zichzelf kan zijn.
  
Wij hebben uitstekende arbeidsvoorwaarden, waaronder een mobiliteitsbudget of een leaseauto, een jaarlijks ontwikkelbudget en dertig vakantiedagen bij een fulltime dienstverband.
  
Sollicitatieprocedure
  
  

Wij willen dat je direct een goede indruk krijgt van de werksfeer en het werk dat je gaat doen, daarom voer je het eerste en tweede sollicitatiegesprek met de eventuele toekomstige collega’s. Het eerste gesprek is vooral om wederzijds te inventariseren of er een klik is en passende motivatie. Vervolgens vragen wij je een schriftelijke opdracht uit te voeren, passend bij de functie. De uitkomst hiervan bespreken wij in het tweede gesprek en dan gaan we dieper in op jouw ervaring en ambities voor de toekomst.
  
  

Zijn wij allebei na dit tweede gesprek enthousiast, dan volgt meestal een assessment bij een extern assessmentbureau. Bij dit assessment worden jouw drijfveren in kaart gebracht, net zoals wanneer jij het beste functioneert én of de functie van consultant bij jou past. Als je bij ons start, vormt het rapport van dit assessment de basis voor jou én ons voor jouw ontwikkeling bij Significant.

We're looking for an experienced Full Stack Developer who is ready to take their skills to the next level, **and help us build complex, data-driven user interfaces on the web from our studio in Utrecht.**


**Apply and let us know** what you could contribute to the team.

**JOIN OUR TEAM**



CLEVER°FRANKE is an enthusiastic, multi-disciplinary team of 50+ people with 15 different nationalities from across the world and we use English as a primary language to communicate and collaborate. We are interaction designers, visual designers, developers, project managers, data analysts and others. All with a passion for what we do. We are curious about the world around us and apply the same curiosity to our work and projects.



As a Full Stack Developer, you will work on cutting-edge projects that make a real difference. Your role will span the entire development spectrum. Whilst you have plenty of experience with crafting intuitive front-end interfaces, you will also be our go-to-team-member to help architect and set-up the required back-end solutions, pipelining and hosting. You will define and lead projects independently and collaborate with designers to produce high-quality user experiences.



Our tech stack is ever evolving. Currently, our favorites include Typescript, React, Next.js / Vite and Panda CSS, but we’re not married to any specific technology. We are pragmatic (choose the stack that gets the job done) and are always open to fresh perspectives on building, scaling, and maintaining our engineering principles. We’re continiously exploring and innovating, and like to work with emerging technologies like AI, AR/VR and physical interfaces.



Though we always adapt our approach to the requirements of a specific project, the development workflow of a typical C°F project will generally include submitting pull requests that trigger CI/CD pipelines with various code-quality checks and automated deployment to a serverless platform like Vercel or Netlify. Team members will perform code reviews to safeguard code-quality as well as QA reviews to make sure all work we do meets the high quality standard that we set for ourselves.

**WHAT YOU BRING**



As **a Full Stack Developer,** you will bring at least 3-5 years of experience in full-stack development. An innovative mindset and eagerness to explore new technologies. Next to that, you will bring:


* Solid front-end skills
* Expertise in back-end development, GraphQL, API-design and databases (e.g. Node.js, Deno, PostgreSQL)
* Familiarity with both Docker and serverless infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Vercel, Netlify)
* Proficiency in Git, code-reviews and CI/CD workflows (e.g. GitHub Actions, CircleCI)
* Excellent communication skills in English.


Experience with search engines like ElasticSearch is a plus, as well as interest and experience with technologies like AI and AR.


**WE'LL WELCOME YOU**



You’re welcome at CLEVER°FRANKE regardless of your appearance, identity, or background. It’s not a place you have to 'fit in' but somewhere everyone can feel themselves and be their best to do their best.



Studies suggest that women, and others, tend to hesitate to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, we look for talent and potential — not just formal experience and expertise. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it, go ahead and apply.  


**WE’LL GIVE YOU:**


* Full-time/part-time role (32-40 hours per week);
* A competitive salary, based on your background and experience;
* Guidance from a friendly, passionate, down-to-earth team;
* Trainings tailored to your personal and professional growth;
* A personal development coach and time to explore your interests;
* Hybrid working from our studio or home – (at least 2 days per week in the studio);
* A healthy, abundant lunch every day in the studio;
* Paid train expenses from your home to the studio;
* A collective pension plan;
* A MacBook and all the peripherals you need;
* Inspiring team events; such as our annual team prototyping day, team trainings, sport events and conference visits.


**WE'LL SUPPORT YOU**



We find it important that you grow and challenge yourself and want to ensure that you are supported in this. We offer training courses tailored to your experience level and needs, personal development planning and feedback, and an HR coach. About 3 times a year, we organize a CLEVER°FRANKE Development week where the entire studio fully focuses on personal and professional growth, outside of client projects.

**WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN US?**



 Send us your CV (portfolio) and we'll ask you some questions to get to know you a little better.



If you successfully pass through our screening, we’ll invite you to the interview process, which entails three further conversations to ensure you get to know our culture and the role better, and to identify whether there is a fit from both of our sides.

Zet jouw analysevaardigheden in als analist bij de politie en draag hiermee bij aan de bestrijding van georganiseerde ondermijnende criminaliteit. Dit is je kans want het Team Analyse en Onderzoek van de Dienst Regionale Intelligence Organisatie (DRIO) in de Eenheid Zeeland West-Brabant is op zoek naar vier flexibele analisten voor de werkterreinen veiligheids- en zaaksanalyse.

Analyse & Onderzoek, Intelligence
### **Niveau:**


HBO BACHELOR
**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Binnen analyse maken we onderscheid tussen twee verschillende werkterreinen: veiligheids- en zaaksanalyse. Afhankelijk van je achtergrond, interesse en voorkeur word je op één van de werkterreinen in onze organisatie ingezet.


***Veiligheidsanalist***  

Als veiligheidsanalist stel je analyses op die gebaseerd zijn op een analysevraag vanuit de geprioriteerde thema’s, bijvoorbeeld de duiding van cruciale rollen van subjecten binnen een crimineel samenwerkingsverband. Jouw analyses kunnen ook ongevraagd tot stand komen als gevolg van een door jou gesignaleerd veiligheidsprobleem, fenomeen of trend. Je onderzoekt en analyseert de beschikbare data in samenhang en duidt deze naar ernst, aard en omvang. Hiervoor gebruik je jouw kennis van methoden en technieken. De analyses zet je om in concrete interventieadviezen ter ondersteuning van de sturing op (integrale) veiligheidsvraagstukken. Een advies kan bijvoorbeeld gericht zijn op de aanpak van subjecten of het prioriteren van thema’s zoals ondermijning, cybercrime of underground banking. Jouw adviezen zijn erop gericht om de politie de meest optimale keuzes te laten maken op basis van de beschikbare informatie.


***Zaaksanalist***


Als zaaksanalist word je ingezet bij grootschalige opsporingsonderzoeken, waarbij je bijdraagt aan de hoofdvraag ‘wat is er gebeurd’. Naast antwoord krijgen op de hoofdvraag, zorg je ervoor dat je de informatie die kan bijdragen aan onze algehele informatiepositie op de juiste plek wordt geadresseerd en op de juiste wijze wordt vastgelegd. Je staat als analist onafhankelijk in het onderzoek en kijkt met een kritische en brede blik naar de informatie. Je voorkomt tunnelvisie. Dit doe je onder andere door het reconstrueren van het meest aannemelijke scenario en het in beeld brengen van eventuele alternatieve scenario’s. Je analytische vaardigheden en creativiteit komen daarbij goed bij van pas. Je komt in aanraking met de meest uiteenlopende zware delicten en staat midden in de dynamiek van de opsporing en intelligence. Je bent dus een belangrijke schakel in de optimale werking van opsporingsonderzoeken en intelligence.


**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


Je gaat binnen de Eenheid Zeeland-West-Brabant werken bij het Team Analyse & Onderzoek dat onderdeel is van de DRIO. Het team voert, in nauwe samenwerking met het Team Business Intelligence, onderzoeken uit naar veiligheidsproblemen, zorgt voor de uitvoering van operationele, tactische en strategische analyses en voert data-analyses uit op grote gegevensverzamelingen. Verzamelde en veredelde informatie vormt de basis voor analyses en onderzoeken die zicht geven op het veiligheidsbeeld op geografisch en thematisch vlak. Een deel van het team voert de werkzaamheden decentraal in de operatie uit, bijvoorbeeld bij de opsporing of andere afdelingen van de DRIO. Een ander deel doet (semi-) wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar veiligheidsvraagstukken.


Het team is voortdurend in doorontwikkeling en anticipeert daarbij op de behoeftes uit onze professionele omgeving, de snelle ontwikkelingen van digitale mogelijkheden en de veranderingen in de maatschappij. Dat vraagt van elk teamlid alert en proactief gedrag. De regionale context van de eenheid, en vooral de manier waarop ondermijnende criminaliteit zich in het werkgebied manifesteert, is ook van grote invloed op de ontwikkelrichting van de DRIO. Als de operatie daarom vraagt ben je flexibel ten aanzien van je werktijden en ben je indien nodig inzetbaar voor piketdiensten.


Je maakt deel uit van een team waarin je jezelf mag zijn. Naast verschillende achtergronden en culturen hebben we ons blauwe hart overeenkomstig. Wij waarderen verschillen omdat ons werk om verschillende perspectieven vraagt. Gezien de aard van de werkzaamheden is er altijd aandacht vanuit de leiding voor jou en je collega's.


**Wie ben jij?**
----------------


Jij bent iemand met een ijzersterk analytisch vermogen, je werkt gestructureerd, bent ondernemend en kunt jouw visie helder en enthousiast delen met anderen. Uit grote hoeveelheden data weet jij de relevante informatie te destilleren en informatie uit verschillende bronnen breng je met elkaar in verband. Je durft daarnaast af te wijken van de gebaande paden, kijkt met een frisse blik naar de problematiek en komt met eigen initiatieven. Je bent een aanpakker en bent in staat complexe materie om te zetten in concrete adviezen waarbij je écht een bijdrage aan het politiewerk levert. Hierbij neem je een onafhankelijk standpunt in, waardoor je open-minded blijft kijken en feiten en aannames goed van elkaar weet te scheiden.


Je bent zeer vaardig in de digitale buitenwereld en je hebt kennis van diverse (andere) interne en externe bronnen. Je beschikt over goede schrijfvaardigheid en vindt het leuk om overtuigend te presenteren of op een andere creatieve manier jouw boodschap over te brengen. Het maakt voor jou niet uit of je te maken hebt met een team van rechercheurs, leidinggevenden, specialisten of met een officier van justitie. Je bent in alle gevallen in staat jouw boodschap en presentaties aan de doelgroep aan te passen. Je zorgt voor verbinding met de mensen met wie je werkt en bent gericht op samenwerking. Je bent je ervan bewust dat je werkt in een vertrouwelijke omgeving en weet hier zowel zakelijk als privé goed mee om te gaan.


Verder beschikt over hbo (bachelor) werk- en denkniveau\* en bij voorkeur heb je:


* affiniteit met de opsporing;
* vakmatige kennis van het analysevak en je kunt zelfstandig in het vakgebied opereren;
* onderzoeksvaardigheden om betrouwbare informatieproducten op te leveren;
* ervaring met diverse analysetools of affiniteit en ervaring met complexere tools vanuit de eigen werkomgeving;
* ervaring met datagedreven werken of aantoonbare affiniteit met een voor de politie belangrijk thema;
* kennis van de volgende aanvullende kennisgebieden; data-analyse, geo-analyse, financieel-economische criminaliteit, onderzoeksjournalistiek, cybercrime of contra-terrorisme;
* een rijbewijs B.

Je vormt de brug tussen het DCC en de business (voor nu alle stakeholders binnen Alfa). Je hebt een voorlichtende en coördinerende functie naar de business: Dit is enerzijds het proactief communiceren over data, datagedreven werken en nieuwe ontwikkelingen op dit gebied.



Anderzijds ben je verantwoordelijk voor een succesvol verloop van rapportage aanvragen: van aanvraag, tussentijds toetsen van het verloop, onderhouden van contacten met de stakeholders, levering, adoptie en het continu optimalisatieproces van een rapportage. Hierbij is het proactief communiceren en stakeholder management van groot belang.



DCC werkt Agile, dus bovengenoemde werkzaamheden worden volgens de Agile wow uitgevoerd. Jij zal dan ook de rol als Product Owner binnen het team op je nemen. In overleg met management kunnen er projecten opgepakt worden wat bijdraagt aan het uitrollen van de datastrategie en datagedreven werken binnen Alfa.

Dit doe je door inzichten te verzamelen over de effectiviteit en impact van marketing- en media inzet, zoals welke mediakanalen het meest effectief zijn, wat de juiste doelgroep is en hoe je deze het meest effectief bereikt. Dit begint vaak met het bepalen van de belangrijkste KPI's voor de klant en de doorvertaling daarvan naar marketing en media. Door middel van een meetplan zorg je dat dit continue kan worden gemeten en geoptimaliseerd, waarvoor we vaak een test & learn plan opzetten van de klant. Kortom; alles om data-gedreven groei voor de klant te behalen, door continue te leren en te optimaliseren!

Van de activatie van 1st party data, doelgroep segmentatie, personalisatie, automatisering, Marketing Mix Modelling, CX-optimalisatie tot visualisatie; je werkt samen met collega's vanuit strategie teams, andere data specialismes, media en creatie. Daarbij sla jij de brug tussen strategie en executie; je borgt de strategische richting en scherpt deze aan door wat de praktijk aantoont.

Je werkt samen aan projecten, overlegt over de aanpak en vanuit eerdere ervaring. Omdat iedere klant andere wensen, doelen en context heeft, is het belangrijk op de hoogte te zijn van ontwikkelingen en mogelijkheden in de markt en binnen GroupM; verschillende meetmethodes, technische implementaties, veranderingen in marketing & media platformen en de nieuwste innovaties. In deze dynamische wereld is het belangrijk om flexibel en leergierig te zijn.

Je bent onderdeel van een interdisciplinair datateam (van Data Science tot Technische Web Analisten), waarin we kennis delen en samenwerken op toffe projecten, maar ook daarbuiten biedt GroupM allerlei mogelijkheden om te leren en te ontwikkelen. Daarnaast duiken we graag samen het terras op en organiseren activiteiten als boulderen of pubquizes!

Zie jij uitdaging in de complexiteit van maatschappelijke vraagstukken? Haal je graag inzichten uit data om daarmee impact te maken? Vind je het leuk om projectteams aan te sturen en sta je graag in contact met de klant? Maak dan met ons het verschil.
  
  

Wat ga je doen?
  
  

Als (senior) onderzoeker econometrie werk je mee aan verschillende projecten tegelijk in het publieke domein. Je houdt je hiertoe bijvoorbeeld bezig met het meten van effecten van beleid of het (door)ontwikkelen van voorspelmodellen. Dit doe je veelal als projectleider en altijd in een interdisciplinair team. Je overziet, stuurt aan, verbindt en neemt eindverantwoordelijkheid. Ook neem je de leiding in uiteenlopende data-analyses voor opdrachtgevers als ministeries, uitvoeringsorganisaties, gemeenten en samenwerkingsverbanden. Deze data-analyses doe je samen met een andere (junior) econometrist of data-analist. Zo vergroot je niet alleen jouw eigen kennis over data-analyse en de publieke sector, maar ook die van een collega!
  
  

Voorbeeldprojecten
  
Het ontwikkelen van een simulatiemodel beschermd wonen dat het aantal cliënten per jaar voorspelt in verschillende scenario’s;
  
Het onderzoeken van belemmeringen van bijstandsgerechtigden bij het delen van woonruimte. Als econometrist onderzoek je in dit geval het effect van de kostendelersnorm op dakloosheid van jongeren;
  
Doorontwikkeling van het risicovereveningsmodel. Met het risicovereveningsmodel worden de verwachte kosten van verzekerden zo goed mogelijk ingeschat.
  
Wie zijn wij?
  
  

Significant Groep is georganiseerd in de vier ventures APE, Public, Insights en Synergy. Deze ventures zijn de thuisbasis voor verschillende competenties die wij inzetten. Waarbij onderlinge samenwerking de meerwaarde is naar onze opdrachtgevers voor het beste resultaat.
  
  

Significant APE is het onderzoeksbureau binnen de Significant Groep dat gespecialiseerd is in beleidsvraagstukken in de publieke sector. Wij werken aan maatschappelijke vraagstukken in opdracht van ministeries en gemeenten. Bij ons werken leergierige en ambitieuze onderzoekers die van nature nieuwsgierig zijn, die gedreven worden door het willen weten en niet loslaten totdat ze alle informatie boven tafel hebben. Significant APE is een warme organisatie waarin wij naar elkaar omkijken en samen de schouders eronder zetten om tot het beste resultaat te komen voor en met onze opdrachtgevers. Wij ondersteunen opdrachtgevers bij de ontwikkeling van (financiële) verdeelmodellen en het uitvoeren van impactanalyses, beleidsevaluaties, effectiviteitsmetingen en geavanceerde (econometrische) analyses.
  
  

Wie ben jij?
  
Je hebt een wo-opleiding econometrie of aanverwante opleiding gevolgd;
  
Je hebt ervaring/affiniteit met het aansturen van collega’s op inspirerende en motiverende wijze;
  
Jij bedenkt samen met collega’s de beste aanpak voor het beantwoorden van een vraag van één van onze opdrachtgevers, waarbij jij collega’s aanstuurt en de gekozen aanpak overtuigend op papier zet (dit laat je zien tijdens een opdracht in het sollicitatieproces);
  
Je kan werken onder tijdsdruk; je hebt er bijvoorbeeld geen moeite mee om in een paar weken een plan van aanpak te schrijven of om in een paar maanden een onderzoek te doen, van opzet tot rapportage.
  
Wat bieden wij?
  
Een divers palet aan interessante opdrachtgevers waarvoor jij aan de beste samenwerkingsoplossingen werkt.
  
Werken aan projecten die er echt toe doen en daarmee de mogelijkheid om een bijdrage te leveren aan de maatschappij
  
Opleidingsmogelijkheden zowel middels onze eigen Academy als door het volgen van externe trainingen, events en/of opleidingen
  
Mensgerichte organisatie waarin we naar elkaar omkijken.
  
Vrijheid en flexibiliteit bieden om zelf je agenda te bepalen en naar eigen inzicht je tijd in te delen.
  
Wij streven naar een inclusieve en veilige werkomgeving waar we diversiteit omarmen en waar iedereen gelijke kansen krijgt. Wij zijn een organisatie waarbij iedereen meetelt, welkom en zichzelf kan zijn.
  
Wij hebben uitstekende arbeidsvoorwaarden, waaronder een mobiliteitsbudget of een leaseauto, een jaarlijks ontwikkelbudget en dertig vakantiedagen bij een fulltime dienstverband.
  
Sollicitatieprocedure
  
  

Wij willen dat je direct een goede indruk krijgt van de werksfeer en het werk dat je gaat doen, daarom voer je het eerste en tweede sollicitatiegesprek met de eventuele toekomstige collega’s. Het eerste gesprek is vooral om wederzijds te inventariseren of er een klik is en passende motivatie. Vervolgens vragen wij je een schriftelijke opdracht uit te voeren, passend bij de functie. De uitkomst hiervan bespreken wij in het tweede gesprek en dan gaan we dieper in op jouw ervaring en ambities voor de toekomst.
  
  

Zijn wij allebei na dit tweede gesprek enthousiast, dan volgt meestal een assessment bij een extern assessmentbureau. Bij dit assessment worden jouw drijfveren in kaart gebracht, net zoals wanneer jij het beste functioneert én of de functie van consultant bij jou past. Als je bij ons start, vormt het rapport van dit assessment de basis voor jou én ons voor jouw ontwikkeling bij Significant.

Jij helpt klanten hun IT zo in te richten en strategisch te sturen dat het maximaal bijdraagt aan hun organisatiedoelen. Dat betekent dat je de werking van de IT-organisatie, IT-processen en IT-aansturing bij klanten analyseert. Op basis daarvan geef je advies over de besturing die past bij de doelen en kenmerken van de organisatie, inclusief de benodigde rollen voor optimale IT-ondersteuning tijdens hun digitale transformatie.

In deze rol verbind je de business en IT, en breng je de uitdagingen van beide goed naar voren. Je kunt optreden als analist, specialist, proces- of informatiemanager. Het is een afwisselende functie, waarbij je voor meerdere opdrachtgevers verschillende rollen vervult. Door je brede inzetbaarheid werk je samen met diverse specialisten van de klant en collega's van Highberg.

**Voorbeelden van projecten die jij uitvoert als Consultant informatiemanagement**

De rode draad is dat je het leuk vindt om opdrachtgevers te helpen bij een optimale inrichting en besturing van de informatievoorziening. Voorbeelden van projecten die je uitvoert:

* Je voert een analyse uit op de volwassenheid van de regieprocessen van IT en doet voorstellen voor verbetering op zowel processen, rollen als besturing. In 3 maanden vorm je samen met een collega een zo goed mogelijk beeld van de organisatie van IT aan de hand van onze methodiek en leveren jullie een analyse, inclusief voorgestelde roadmap voor verbetering, op aan de klant.
* Je helpt een overheidsorganisatie met het optimaliseren van de organisatie om te voldoen aan het IV-stelsel Rijk. Je inventariseert de stakeholders, interviewt diverse belangrijke spelers, leest je in over de historie en doet voorstellen voor uitgangspunten en uiteindelijke invulling.
* Je stelt een informatiestrategie en informatieplannen op voor een uitvoeringsorganisatie waarin aandacht is voor de uitdaging van vandaag de dag zoals inzet van AI, compliancy aan (Europese) wetgeving en duurzaamheidsafwegingen. Je faciliteert inspiratiesessies met business en IT, werkt samen met gebruikers, informatiearchitecten en specialisten op diverse aandachtsgebieden.
* Je coacht informatiemanagers in hun rol en adviseert hen in de uitdagingen waar zij voor staan. Je kijkt mee waar zij tegen aan lopen in de praktijk en bent een sparringspartner die ook zo nu en dan de handen uit de mouwen steekt om te helpen.

**Wat is onze visie op Informatiemanagement?**

Informatievoorziening vormt het hart van veel organisaties. IT-toepassingen moeten altijd beschikbaar zijn en data moet betrouwbare management- en verantwoordingsinformatie opleveren voor strategische beslissingen. Toenemende eisen vanuit wet- en regelgeving en ethische overwegingen spelen een cruciale rol in de vormgeving van informatievoorziening.

Onze klanten staan midden in de maatschappij en gebruiken IT-toepassingen vaak voor samenwerking met partners, waardoor deze toepassingen waardevol moeten zijn voor klanten en burgers. Onze adviezen hebben daardoor vaak direct maatschappelijke impact. Organisaties moeten waarde toevoegen en verantwoord handelen. Een effectieve informatievoorziening is hierin een essentiële schakel.

Wij begrijpen deze waarde en verbinden verschillende disciplines, waarbij we informatievoorziening benaderen met de vragen: 'Wat kan, wat mag en wat is wenselijk?'. Zo dragen wij bij aan een informatievoorziening die bijdraagt aan het succes van maatschappelijke organisaties.

**Wat vragen wij?**

* Een afgeronde HBO- of WO-opleiding op het gebied van informatie-, organisatie- of bedrijfskunde;
* Minimaal 4 jaar ervaring in de IT, informatiemanagement, regie. Of brede ervaring in (IT-)consultancy;
* Kennis over en ervaring met informatiemanagement, regie-organisaties, en gerelateerde werkwijzen zoals IT-servicemanagement voor besturing en beheersing van IT;
* Uitstekende beheersing van de Nederlandse taal in woord en geschrift;
* Een commerciële instelling, analytisch sterk en een proactieve aanpak in relatiebeheer, netwerken en offertetrajecten.

**Wie ben jij?**

* Je hebt een breedbeeld van nieuwe ontwikkelingen op gebied van wetgeving, veiligheid en ethiek, inzet van data en A.I., duurzaamheid en hun betekenis voor de klant;
* Je bent communicatief vaardig en een organisatiesensitief persoon die op verschillende niveaus weet te communiceren en adviseren;
* Iemand die een probleem snel kan doorgronden en dat zo eenvoudig mogelijk kan verwoorden;
* Iemand die het leuk vindt om bij te dragen aan uitdagende, maatschappelijk relevante opdrachten en vraagstukken.

**Wat bieden wij?**

* Een marktconform salaris en uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden waaronder prestatiebeloning, voorzieningen voor mobiliteit, pensioen en verlof;
* Oprechte aandacht voor persoonlijke ontwikkeling waaronder coaching door collega’s, toegang toe en breed opleidings- en trainingsaanbod en een persoonlijk ontwikkelplan met bijpassende investeringen;
* Een plek binnen een uitdagende en groeiende organisatie waar het nemen van eigen verantwoordelijkheid wordt gewaardeerd, je de autonomie en vrijheid hebt om je werk flexibel uit te voeren met korte communicatielijnen met collega’s;
* Een prettige werkomgeving met een prettig en goed bereikbaar kantoor, focus op prestaties als team en niet op het individu en tal van sociale activiteiten zoals borrels, sportactiviteiten en teamsamenkomsten.

**Background**


Within ING we make use of data science for a variety of use cases (such as improving financial health of our customers by transaction forecasting). The data science models which run in production all generate output this data needs to be delivered to different destination within ING. These destinations vary from data lakes and kafka topics to Cassandra datastores.


In the past a generic Interface format (GI) was developed as a one size fits all solution to standardize the output delivery for our data-scientists. Over time many models have adopted this interface but we are now facing challenges such as files which became too big or the throughput time is too long.

**The opportunity**


We would like to deep-dive into this topic by dedicating an intern as engineer to investigate our use cases and look for a future proof solution. This includes gathering information, do market research (buy vs built) and design / develop one or more prototypes together with our data-scientists data engineers.

**Team** **overview**


You, as an intern will join one of our data-engineering teams which support the ING data-scientists. The teams work on a variety of topics to maintain and evolve our data-analytics environment in Google Cloud.

* Located in our Amsterdam office.
* Mix of local and off-shore colleagues (so multiple nationalities)
* We work in agile teams based around Scrum and continuous delivery principles.
* Our teams work in hybrid mode, we work from home when possible and work from the office at least one day a week.
* We have 36 hour working weeks.

**Roles and responsibilities**


This assignment is about understanding and improving our way of distributing data-science model output. The current implementation of GI (Generic Interface) needs to be examined as well as our use cases and the industry standards available. The goal is to boost new alternatives and bring us further in achieving an excellent data-driven organization.

**Expected l****earnings**

You will be working in an environment with modern continuous delivery tools with people who have a continuous improvement mindset. Tools include Azure (CDaaS), Google GCP (Terraform, Vertex AI, BigQuery), NiFi for data flow management.


Working in a complex environment such as ING can be challenging and this is part of the learning and our people and teams are there to help you.


Communication and collaboration are key and this involves working closely together with domain experts such as data-engineers, data-scientists and machine learning engineers.

**Expected output**


An inventory of required features, an improved understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the current implementation and a redesign plus implementation plan (part of this can also contain a buy vs built decision or a vendor selection).


When time allows the output also consists of the implementation of a prototype solution.

**How to succeed**


You can succeed in this role by showing:

* a “can-do” mentality
* you are a “self starter” (pro-active)
* you speak out and like to challenge yourself and the people around you
* you have a background in IT, information management or similar
* experience and affinity with machine learning is very useful
* it helps if you like programming (python, java, scala) though this is not a show stopper

**Rewards and benefits**  

This is a great opportunity to train with highly skilled people who are experts in their field. You’ll do a lot and learn a lot –  

not only about your specialist area and the bank, but also about yourself and whether this type of environment is right for you.

  

You’ll also benefit from:

* Internship allowance of EUR 700/month for 36 hours (maximum)
* Compensation of travel costs
* Your own work laptop
* Hybrid working to blend home working for focus and office working for collaboration and co-creation
* Personal growth and challenging work with endless possibilities

Job description


Moral problems are often thought of as dilemmas, with two options. However, in real-life there is often a potentially infinite number of choices that a moral agent can make in response to a problem.



Coming up with these potential responses, and reflecting on what they might mean and how they might play out in the world, requires creativity. This project investigates the role of creativity (including artistic creativity) in moral decision making, especially in connection with the innovation of technologies. The envisaged outcomes of this project include a theory of the role of creativity in the responsible development and anticipation of new technologies, and the establishment of methodological tools for transdisciplinary collaborations including artists, philosophers and technology developers. The PhD project will investigate these questions by combining philosophical reasoning with participation in transdisciplinary collaborations involving artists who work at the intersection of art, technology and society. To make this possible, we have established a collaboration with Waag Futurelab, which has experience with the exercise of moral creativity in artistic practice surrounding technologies.



This PhD position will be part of the Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies programme, ESDiT, a ten year long international research programme of seven academic institutions in the Netherlands that has started in January 2020. This programme has a combined budget of €27 million, and is funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research in the Gravitation funding scheme for excellent research, and by matching funds from the participating institutions. The duration is from January 2020 to December 2029. The programme has the aim of achieving breakthrough research in at the intersection of ethics, philosophy, technology / engineering and social sciences, and to position its consortium at the top of its field internationally. A key objective is to investigate how new technologies challenge moral values and ontological concepts (like “nature”, “human being” and “community”), and how these challenges necessitate a revision of these concepts. The programme includes four research lines, “Nature, life and human intervention”, “The future of a free and fair society”, “The human condition” and “Foundation and Synthesis: Ethics of Technology, Practical Philosophy, and Modern Technology-Driven Societies”.



This PhD project will be embedded in the Art Track that cuts across the whole programme. Depending on the interests of the PhD candidate, the project can berelated to one or more of the programme's main research lines. More information can be found on the ESDiT website: https://www.esdit.nl/ The candidate is expected to play an active role in the project described above and to participate actively in the workshops, public events, courses and other activities of the ESDiT programme in general and the Art Track in particular. ESDiT-PhD students are encouraged to spend a semester abroad, and a budget is available to cover expenses. Furthermore, generous (conference) travel budgets are available for the position.

***Would you like to pursue a PhD on intercultural ethics of existential risk? Then apply for a fully funded position at TU Delft's Philosophy Section.***


Job description


Philosophers are increasingly concerned with the impact of socially disruptive technologies on our existing concepts as well as new ones. One such concept that has recently emerged as a response to changing socio-technical circumstances is that of existential risks. Most discussions in the field don't pay attention to intercultural philosophical perspectives. For instance, the concept of existential risk finds its roots in a specific brand of Western-centric normative thinking, thereby influencing how we frame and approach what we find valuable and important for the purposes of preventing existential risks from materializing. The primary goal of the project is to study existential risks as part of broader conceptual cluster disrupted by socio-technological developments through the lens of general intercultural philosophy or a specific non-Western ethical framework. The resulting approach of ‘intercultural ethics of existential risks’ would be operationalized to explore whether and how insights and perspectives from under-represented philosophical traditions bear upon understanding existential risks (and related concepts), and subsequently, normative and practical questions associated with why their mitigation matters, for whom, and so on.



This PhD position will be part of the Ethics of Socially Disruptive Technologies programme, ESDiT, a ten year long international research programme of seven academic institutions in the Netherlands that has started in January 2020.

Are you interested in how synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function help wire the developing brain? Do you want to use cutting-edge optical techniques for live cell imaging, including 2-photon microscopy? Would you enjoy working in an international environment where you follow up on your ideas with the support of experts around you? Then this job may be for you.  


**What you will be doing?**
The developing mouse visual cortex is wiring up during the week before eye opening and neurons establish most of their synapses during that time. Synaptic transmission is very energy demanding and developing neurons need to provide sufficient energy to fuel transmission at emerging synapses. In this Health-Holland funded project, we will measure the energy balance of developing synapses, how synaptic plasticity affects the energy balance of neurons and whether energy metabolism at developing synapses may be compromised in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders.
You will be able to take advantage of the latest microscopy approaches, such as 2-photon microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging, to investigate how developing synapses satisfy their energy demands. Since these processes underly proper wiring of the brain, it is not surprising that errors in energy metabolism are associated with developmental disorders and therefore your project may not only help better understand brain wiring, but also shed light on the underlying causes of developmental cognitive disorders.  


**Who are we looking for?**
You are a highly motivated, self-driven candidate with a Master’s degree in neuroscience, (neuro)psychology, biomedical sciences or natural sciences. The ideal candidate will have experience with neurophysiological and/or live cell imaging techniques and a solid background in neuroscience. Programming skills - in particular with Python for data analysis - will be very useful for your project. You are a team player and comfortable communicating, presenting and writing in English.  


**What do we offer?**
We offer ample opportunities for further development of knowledge and technical and personal skills through courses at the Academy and (inter)national conferences and:
* Good terms of employment (see further)
* Mentoring, supervision and training
* Access to state-of-the art equipment

One important difference between human milk and infant formula is the fat droplet interface composition and structure, which can greatly impact digestibility. To make digestion more comparable, a better understanding of the relationship between interface composition and functionality is needed, which can be used to improve the structure of infant formula. One option to stabilize the fat droplet interface is using milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), which has been introduced as a promising natural ingredient. However, the composition of MFGM ingredients can greatly vary depending on isolation methods. The extent of this variability and its effect on MFGM functionality remains unknown.  

  

The main aim of this project is, therefore, to understand the impact of processing-induced variations in MFGM composition on their functionalities, particularly in terms of physicochemical stability and digestibility of the emulsions. You will work in close connection with a second PhD candidate in the Food Chemistry group, who uses these insights to develop plant-based alternatives.  

  

**What will you do?**  

As a PhD candidate, you will contribute to:* production and characterisation of MFGM extracts;
* characterization of their emulsification properties;
* digestibility of these emulsions;
* performing comparisons on the systems with MFGM and plant-based alternatives.

**Your duties and responsibilities include:*** taking charge of the PhD project and performing the proposed research;
* developing and executing analysis on state-of-the-art chemical analytical equipment;
* publishing your results in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presenting them at (inter)national scientific conferences and/or symposia;

* collaborating with the other team members and partners from the larger consortium;
* fulfilling the requirements of the PhD program, including completing a training and supervision plan to develop your personal skills as a researcher further.

**You will work here**  

The research is embedded within the chair of Food Quality and Design, and you will become a member of a dynamic and international group that also includes a team of dairy scientists. During your PhD, you will use state-of-the-art analytics, such as e.g., liquid (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), static or semi-dynamic digestion models (based on INFOGEST protocol). You will be part of the Dairy Chemistry and Physics team, which is led by dr. Etske Bijl. During your PhD, your will also be co-supervised by dr. Marie Hennebelle who is leading the Lipid Chemistry team. Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:* partially paid parental leave;
* working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;

Challenge: Transforming the conventional carbon-intensive energy use



Change: AI to turn data into knowledge for efficient systems



Impact: Boosting the sustainable, fair and reliable energy transition


Job description


TU Delft is a top tier university and is exceedingly active in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with a strong expertise in energy systems. Energy systems are the backbone of our modern society, but are becoming increasingly complex and challenging to operate as renewable energy, heating and transport sectors are integrated into the system. It’s crucially important that energy systems are sustainable, reliable and effective, now and in the future.



As part of your 4-year PhD project, you will develop novel graph-based machine learning algorithms for state estimation of energy systems. The scientific challenge is to design a real-time state estimator for an active distribution system considering future needs. The future system requires tasks to manage flexibility provisions from distribution systems, effective anomaly detection, congestion management, and fraud detection. State estimation is an important task where the operator considers very little noisy measurement data to infer the full system state. However, often, the accuracy is used to infer the full state while the true state is seldom known and can only be reproduced in computer simulations. Therefore, you will explore a novel approach investigating graph neural networks and structural information and learn the state-estimator weakly-supervised enforcing known constraints. Your PhD research will be in the area of applied data-driven scientific computing combining statistics, time-frequency analysis, low-dimensional model reductions, and other techniques to extract information from data. With implicit or explicit methods, you will apply weakly-supervised learning making the information useful for the management and planning of complex energy systems, for example with graph neural networks.



You will be hired as a PhD researcher at TU Delft. Your academic supervisors are Dr. Jochen Cremer and Prof. Peter Palensky. Recognising the transformational power of AI, TU Delft joins forces in the Innovation Center for AI (ICAI) with the distribution system operator Alliander and with other Dutch Universities. As a member of the Intelligent Electrical Power Grids research group at TU Delft, you will be affiliated researcher with the ICAI AI for Energy Grids Lab and with Delft AI Energy Lab where we combine ground-breaking AI methods with the reliable theory of the physical energy system. Practically, you will spend one day a week at Alliander (in Arnhem) where you will be supported by around 10 scientific staff, data scientists and power system experts.



About the department at TU Delft:



The research in the Department of Electrical Sustainable Energy is inspired by the technical, scientific, and societal challenges originating from the transition towards a more sustainable society and focuses on four areas:


* DC Systems, Energy Conversion and Storage (DCE&S)
* Photovoltaic Materials and Devices (PVMD)
* Intelligent Electrical Power Grids (IEPG)
* High Voltage Technologies (HVT)


The Electrical Sustainable Energy Department provides expertise in each of these areas throughout the entire energy system chain. The department owns a large ESP laboratory assembling High Voltage testing, DC Grids testing environment, and a large RTDS that is actively used for real-time simulation of future electrical power systems, AC and DC protection, and wide-area monitoring and protection.



The Intelligent Electrical Power Grid (IEPG) group, headed by Professor Peter Palensky, works on the future of our power system. The goal is to generate, transmit and use electrical energy in a highly reliable, efficient, stable, clean, affordable, and safe way. IEPG integrates new power technologies and smart controls, which interact with other systems and allow for more distributed and variable generation.


Requirements


* An MSc degree in either Machine Learning, Robotics, Control Systems, Operations Research or in Power/Energy Systems, Electrical Engineering, etc.

There is ample evidence showing that the human population is on an unsustainable trajectory, with increasing CO2 emissions and declining biodiversity. While knowledge on the climate system is growing, our ways to teach students and engage with the public regarding this information is keeping up with this pace. In this position, you will combine teaching and research on the interface between the sciences and the arts.


**Your job**
------------


Moving towards a sustainability transformation requires our students to adapt to change and to develop their capacity to shape and create change. For this, it is important to connect the cognitive learning objectives (head) with practical skill development (hand) and affective learning objectives (heart). In this PhD project, the aim is to implement the head-hand-heart approach in our climate change research and education. You will therefore be working on the interface between the sciences and the arts. On the one hand, you will work on environmental topics, including data gathering in the field or living labs, and data harvesting from large data repositories, data analysis and modelling. On the other hand, you will work together with the University of the Arts Utrecht (HKU), working, for instance, on gamification and sonification of climate science.


To explore and study the interface between the climate sciences and the arts, the Copernicus Institute of sustainable development is looking for a combined teacher-PhD candidate with an interest in education and sustainability & climate science. In this position, you will combine research on environmental sciences and sustainability education with teaching in our bachelor and master programmes. As a combined teacher-PhD candidate, you have a six-year contract to complete your PhD research and obtain a University Teaching Qualification (UTQ/BKO) in combination with teaching and education development.


Teaching is primarily based at the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, in the Bachelor Global Sustainability Science and the Master Sustainable Development. Your time between research and teaching is divided 60-40. In addition, approximately 10% of your time is allocated for professional and academic development, for instance for obtaining a University Teaching Qualification (UTQ/BKO) and following PhD courses. You will also join the Geosciences Graduate School for PhDs.


**Your qualities**
------------------


We are looking for a candidate with a background in natural sciences and a proven passion for sustainability education. You are somebody that likes to prepare your students for the great challenges of the coming decades with your teaching and research. As an ideal candidate you have:


* a Master’s degree (or you graduate before starting date) in Environmental Sciences, Sustainability Sciences, Earth Sciences, Biology, or a related field;
* proven ability to work with large datasets and model-output;
* affinity with the societal context of sustainability challenges;
* interest in and a positive experience with teaching (e.g. teaching assistant, junior teacher, high school teacher);
* motivation to further develop your teaching skills and acquire the University Teaching Qualification (UTQ/BKO);
* energy to combine teaching and research over a 6-year period;
* excellent communication and academic writing skills in English (equivalent to B2).


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for one year, with an extension to a total of six years upon successful assessment;
* a working week of 36 hours and a gross monthly salary between €3,226 and €5,090 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale 10 under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth.

De opleiding


De opleiding Applied Data Science & Artificial Intelligence (ADS&AI) is voor studenten die begrijpen dat, naast technische en niet-technische competenties, de ontwikkelde AI oplossingen ook een verantwoordelijkheid met zich meebrengen (responsible AI).


We staan als opleiding voor een open en respectvolle leeromgeving en vinden het belangrijk dat onze studenten met plezier en vertrouwen hun studie volgen. Er is gekozen voor een geïntegreerd onderwijsconcept waarbij de ontwikkelingsgerichtheid van de student centraal staat. Dat betekent dat de student gericht wordt opgeleid aan de hand van onze zes competenties (responsible technology, drie technische competenties en twee professionele competenties). Studenten ontvangen regelmatig feedback en mogen fouten maken. Vertrouwen opbouwen in hun eigen kunnen is iets wat we de studenten mee willen geven.


We leren studenten om oplossingen en toepassingen voor uiteenlopende stakeholders te onderzoeken, te ontwerpen en te bouwen. De studenten worden niet alleen technisch goed onderlegd, ze leren ook te adviseren en communiceren over inzichten en oplossingen. Het onderwijs richt zich voornamelijk op projecten waarbij we zo dicht mogelijk de praktijk proberen te benaderen. Dit doen we in het 1e studiejaar aan de hand van vier thema’s: data driven society, smart & social city, data driven logistics en data supported healthcare. Er wordt vooral met echte opdrachtgevers gewerkt.

**Your job**
------------


How the overturning circulation of the Mediterranean Sea responds to variations in forcing (tectonics and climate) is a fundamental question that potentially has global significance given that Mediterranean circulation has elements in common with the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. It is also a highly relevant question for the countries bordering the sea in view of our warming climate.


In this NWO (Dutch Research Council)-funded project we will exploit the paleoceanographical record of the late Quaternary which provides an exceptional dataset on e.g. water properties, intensity of intermediate and deep-water formation and strait flow. You will design and execute experiments with dynamic box models and evaluate their results using the available data. The geometrically simple box model is chosen because it can be run following the evolution of circulation and water properties through time, thus doing justice to the transient nature of the processes at play. The analysis will focus on the role of:


* the Strait of Sicily;
* the properties of the inflowing waters; and
* sea-level variation.


You will be based at the department of Earth Sciences where you will be part of a vibrant PhD community and where expertise in both paleoceanography/paleoclimate and numerical modelling is amply available.


A personalised training programme will be set up, reflecting your training needs and career objectives. About 20% of your time will be dedicated to this training component, which includes training on the job in assisting in the Bachelor’s and Master’s programmes of the department.


**Your qualities**
------------------

**Your job**
------------


The aim of this PhD project is to test whether chimpanzees have the capability and motivation to develop cumulative cultures – the process in which cultural innovations incrementally shape cultural expressions such that they become better suited for their envisioned purpose. You will study chimpanzees’ potential to create and maintain cumulatively established cultures by means of targeted experimental assays. Moreover, you will investigate whether chimpanzees’ social network properties are predictive of their potential to develop cumulative cultures with behavioural observations and network analyses. The position involves 90% research time and 10% teaching activities within the group.


You will be hosted in the Primate Culture Origins Group, led by Dr Edwin van Leeuwen. The group focuses on cultural evolution in non-human primates. You will be embedded in this team in Utrecht, and co-supervised by Daniel Haun, director of the Department of Comparative Cultural Psychology at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI EVA) and Josep Call, Professor in Evolutionary Origins of Mind, University of St. Andrews.


You will conduct a series of studies investigating the cognitive foundations of cumulative cultural evolution in humans’ closest living relatives. The project will be a combination of behavioural studies with chimpanzees in group settings at the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust (CWOT) in Zambia. Furthermore, there are possibilities to conduct research at the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Centre in Germany and the Budongo Research Unit in Edinburgh Zoo. Lastly, there is room to extend research efforts to bonobos. The aim of the project is to assess great apes abilities for cumulative cultural evolution. The project will involve periodic fieldwork (approx. 3-4 months/year) at the CWOT in Zambia.


The CWOT houses chimpanzees in multigenerational groups under semi-natural conditions in a large forested private area in northern Zambia. The chimpanzees forage and sleep outside, and only come inside once per day for supplemental feeding. The setup is very suited for behavioural group-level experiments with relatively high ecological validity.


The project will be a collaborative project involving coordinated contributions from 3 PhD candidates working on the same topic The MPI EVA is recruiting for one of the other PhD positions in this project: PhD for chimpanzees project at MPI EVA.


Come join our team in this exciting PhD position and:


* combine observational and experimental methods involving behavioural and cognitive measures;
* work independently at a remote field-site in Zambia;
* develop theoretical models of cumulative cultural evolution;
* conduct advanced statistical and analytic analyses on behavioural data;
* supervise Bachelor's and Master's students (10% of your time).

Do you want to set up and run a clinical trial to discover how non-nutritive sweeteners affect physiology, metabolism and the microbiome? Are you a nutrition scientist with a keen interest in optimizing foods and diets for health, without compromising taste? Would you like to conduct research that can make an impact on food reformulation and public health? Then this vacancy may be of interest to you.***  

  

The division of Human Nutrition and Health has an opening to conduct research on the impact of non-nutrive sweeteners on physiology, metabolism and the microbiome. As a PhD student you will be managing a controlled dietary intervention trial within the Human Research Unit of the Division of Human Nutrition and Health, analyse the data and write peer reviewed papers on the outcomes of the trial.  

The work is part of a larger PPS project funded by TKI and private partners on non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS). NNS are commonly integrated into products and presumed to be inert. However, recent evidence suggests that supplementation of specific NNS may induce person-specific, microbiome-dependent glycemic alterations. Although recent studies provoke considerable debate, the precise implications of these effects are still largely unknown. It is therefore essential to create further insights into possible health effects of NNS. Especially in a manner similar to the way in which consumers are exposed to them, that is through food products containing NNS. The clinical trial will investigate health effects when NNS's are consumed in a realistic setting.  

  

**Your duties and responsibilities include:*** preparing the medical ethical approval documents in collaboration with the project team;
* designing test diets and operational procedures for a human dietary intervention trial together with the staff of the Human Research Unit (HRU);

En dat is nog niet alles – je groeit als een speer door aan de slag te gaan bij (één van) onze opdrachtgevers.
Het traject is opgedeeld in twee fasen. Het eerste jaar geven we niet alleen je persoonlijke ontwikkeling een boost, maar dompelen we je ook onder in de verschillende facetten van een data scientist. Hoe we dit doen? In de eerste twee weken ben je te vinden op ons Bunnikse kantoor, waar je niet alleen je nieuwe collega’s ontmoet, maar ook toffe trainingen volgt om je hard en soft skills bij te schaven. Het tweede jaar is aan jou om in te vullen, uiteraard word je daarin begeleid door ons: we stellen samen jouw unieke ontwikkelplan op!
Als data scientist creëer je waarde door de juiste vragen te stellen, relevante data te ontsluiten en deze te kunnen vertalen naar pragmatische oplossingen. Je houdt je bezig met een breed scala aan klantgerelateerde analytische vraagstukken, zowel naar aanleiding van bestaande vragen als op basis van kansen die je zelf identificeert en waarmee je collega's durft te verrassen. Je haalt inzichten uit de data en doet voorspellingen waarmee we steeds slimmere beslissingen kunnen nemen. Er is veel ruimte om te leren van ervaren data scientists en je verder te ontwikkelen in relevante tools, zoals SQL, R en PowerBI. Boordevol afwisseling dus!

Schuberg Philis continues to expand its focus on data for a growing number of customers which means that we are looking for Data Engineers.



We keep our customers moving forward by designing, building and running their data landscapes.

You get to actively explore, design, build and run data lakes in AWS. Your work will be completely customer-focused but you will also contribute to expanding and maturing the Schuberg Philis data landscape architecture and all of its initiatives.


**Who are we looking for?**



In this role, you will thrive if you have the following experience:


* Building data pipelines in a cloud-native manner (e.g. S3, Lambda's, Glue, etc )
* Used to working with large data sets in both data lakes (S3) & data warehouses (Redshift)
* Good AWS knowledge, especially all the data related services
* Python & data library ecosystem
* Spark + Spark Streaming (Java/Scala or PySpark)


Nice to have:


* Software development, particularly API's (Python)
* Kafka & Kafka Connect
* Terraform
* Docker
* Proficiency in Dutch
* AWS Data Analytics Certifications


If you are a strong team player who recognizes yourself in the above, likes to take ownership, can work independently as part of a team, and can challenge us on our decisions: we'd like to hear from you.

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)
* Python en SQL

**Fijne pre's:**

* Kennis van jaarrekeningcontrole
* Kennis van Microsoft Fabric
* Kennis van Pyspark

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.  

  

Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?  

  

Naast een afgeronde Bachelor of Master en enkele jaren werkervaring zijn dit de specifieke skills die we zoeken:

Maar dat is zeker niet het enige. De Rabobank is een coöperatieve bank met een missie. Samen met klanten, leden en partners zet de Rabobank zich in voor een sterkere leefomgeving en voor de grote maatschappelijke uitdagingen van nu, met als uitgangspunt dat er samen meer bereikt wordt dan alleen. Die missie kan alleen waargemaakt worden doordat Rabobank een krachtige bank is die efficiënt werkt.


Daarnaast is Rabobank actief betrokken bij veel maatschappelijke initiatieven. Een deel van de winst wordt geïnvesteerd in de samenleving. Verder weg, door te zorgen dat boeren een eerlijke prijs krijgen voor hun producten. En dichtbij, door in heel Nederland samen buurten beter te maken. Zo’n 1250 organisaties in sport en cultuur die voor veel mensen een tweede thuis zijn worden ondersteund. Een ander voorbeeld is het project met Humanitas, waarin mensen worden geholpen die financiële problemen hebben hun thuisadministratie op orde te krijgen. Een derde voorbeeld is dat samen met Vluchtelingenwerk Nederland 1.500 vluchtelingen worden geholpen bij het vinden van een goed passende baan.


Om haar kerntaak blijvend te realiseren heeft Rabobank een ambitieus plan opgesteld waarin het creëren van een optimale Engineering Journey een belangrijke pijler is. Er dient veel te veranderen in de wijze waarop engineers ondersteund worden van idee tot een werkende oplossing. Daarin is de communicatie tussen applicaties een cruciaal onderdeel.

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

Je komt te werken in het organisatieonderdeel Brand, Marketing & Communications, waar onze marketing- en communicatieactiviteiten georganiseerd zijn. Binnen deze afdeling hebben we een aantal multidisciplinaire teams die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de commerciële campagnes en verplichte (product)communicatie per klantsegment. Je komt te werken in zo’n team dat, naast een collega data analist, bestaat uit een product owner, marketeers, copywriters, advertising managers en direct/email marketing specialisten.

Met de werkzaamheden die je gaat uitvoeren in jouw team ben je betrokken vanaf de start van een campagne of communicatietraject tot en met de eindevaluatie. Voorafgaand aan een traject analyseer je potentiële doelgroepen. Je denkt mee over doelstellingen en leid je de data intake waarin alle details rondom het project worden besproken en vastgelegd. Tijdens het project zorg jij dat de juiste klantgroepen de juiste communicatie ontvangen en monitor je bij campagnes altijd de voortgang op de gestelde doelen. En als de campagne ten einde is wordt deze samen met de andere specialisten in je team geëvalueerd.

As a data platform engineer, you will be working on our data platform named Thor. With Thor, we want to create a self-service, metadata driven data platform where data producers can share their data with the data consumers without the platform team being the bottleneck.

 **A few cool new features we have recently implemented:**

* Smart Scheduling that dynamically changes data pipeline configuration based on historical statistics
* A versioned data platform that allows the product to scale to other brands
* Documentation that writes itself

----------------


Are you a Bachelor or a Master student in computer science or a related field? Are you interested in making a difference by streamlining the current tooling that ASML's Machine Control group use, and improving the diagnostic workflow of our users? Then this internship could be interesting for you!

**Background information**

Within the Machine Control group, we are responsible for orchestrating and synchronizing all high-level behavioral actions. We have a large number of modules working in parallel in a large configuration space. Due to the large scale and complexity of the system, there is a need for an abstracted overview of the system.

  

We need such an overview for multiple reasons. It can be used to improve the overall understanding of the system, and it can be used by experts to quickly diagnose unexpected behavior, considerably reducing investigation time.

  

Currently, the process of creating such an overview is mostly manual and labor-intensive task sometimes assisted by rudimentary tooling. The existing tooling does not support diagnostics enough due to low user-friendliness and missing features.

**Assignment description**

The aim of your project is to take the existing tooling as a starting point, polish and extend it such that it can better facilitate diagnostics of the system behavior. In this assignment you will:

* Gather the needs of the experts;
* Ensure the system stores the data required to generate the overview;
* Streamline the tooling to improve the diagnostic workflow of the user;
* Closely interact with users to iteratively create a polished product.

**Your Profile**
----------------


To be a perfect fit for this assignment, you:

* Have background in Computer Science or related;
* Are a bachelor student looking to do your thesis (bachelor graduation project/thesis), or a master student looking to gain work experience (master apprentice);
* Are able to translate functional requirements and design in to software designs;
* Are experienced in Python (required), and experienced in C and/or C++ is a bonus.
* Have knowledge in diagnostic methods (preferred);


Other requirements you need to meet:

* You are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship;
* You need to be located in the Netherlands to be perform your internship. In case you ‘re currently living/studying outside of the Netherlands, please include in your CV/motivation letter willingness to relocate.

***This position seeks a junior scientific programmer to further develop and integrate existing movici and multi-model.nl platforms and support the development of new (multi-)models of infrastructure interactions. The work will be done in close cooperation with PhDs, postdoc, senior experts on modeling theory and decision-making and practitioners from infrastructure providers. This position can potentially be turned into a PhD postion.***


Job description


Infrastructures provide the basis for many critical societal processes, from economy to education, from healthcare to housing and more. The infrastructures are increasingly interdependent on each other, from providing mutual services (like energy and data for mobility), via to providing alternative capacity (like rail, road and waterways), to competing for the same space (like in urban contexts).



Models and simulations are key tools for decision makers, allowing them to build, design, and plan infrastructures. As the need for integrated, cross system insight rises, current monodisciplinary and mono-sectoral models are increasingly unable to provide the required insights. A promising direction is multi-modelling, where different models and simulations are combined in an ecosystem of tools, that can be used and re-used in different configurations. The model ecosystem, and the socio-technical approach to modelling poses new methodological and technical challenges.



Models are instrumental for supporting the social process of decision-making, and are not a goal in themselves. Key model and software requirements will stem from the users and the social process that they are involved in. You, as a developer will be involved in these processes where needed, but are not expected to organize and manage them.



Work will consist of two main lines, platform development and model development support. Platform development involves integration of existing open-source platforms MOVICI and multi-model.nl, identifying new requirements and features from the users and developing them. Model development includes software implementation and general computing and data analysis support for researchers, modelers and modelling and simulation theorists. You may also be asked for advice on the most suitable software solutions, data structures, architectures, code redesign where necessary.



Goal of the position is the further development of the MOVICI and multi-model.nl platform towards a tailored tool for broad impact analysis in a complex stakeholder environment. The later means a lot of attention for describing and modeling scenario’s, a wide range and flexible approach towards evaluative criteria for these scenario’s, clear visualizations in space and time on scenario development, and interconnection with other modeling platforms.



We are looking for a person who enjoys (re)design and implementation ""done right"", with long term maintainability, reusability and generalizability being important, without losing sight of practicality. Willingness to work closely with domain experts and modeling theorists is paramount. Correct and clean representation and implementation of the relevant concepts is much more important than churning out features quickly. You will be working in research focused academic setting, so affinity with science, scientific methods and processes is useful.


Requirements


The software stack is organised around open source workflows: git, python, docker, Apache Airflow, linux shell and some C++. We also make use of REST interfaces and client-server architectures where relevant. Prior experience with these technologies is desirable but is explicitly not expected. We do expect solid python programming ability, high level of general computing skills and eagerness to learn more, as well as a good command of the English language. Dutch proficiency is desired but not necessary.

You are not in it alone! You will get guidance from a team member and have many opportunities to fine-tune your ideas and action plan with colleagues.

  

  

Besides this core project, you will also be invited to participate in the team’s agile rituals and other activities, contribute to the maintenance of existing and building of new reports and can also get your hands dirty in our ongoing dashboard migration and data modelling projects.

**Wat breng jij mee?**

With your 'can do' mentality, you connect the different teams in the data flow from source to dashboard to speed up the generation of insights for all the important business decisions we make every day, based on reliable data. You are able to independently tackle various human and organizational issues, from data collection to managing of expectations.

The Faculty of Science and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) are looking for:

**PhD candidate | Environmental impact assessment of pollution at the ecosystem level (0.8-1.0 fte)**

**Vacancy number: (14994)**


**Background**


The freshwater system and its adjacent ecosystems host countless species because of their need of water. These are the earths’ natural capital and drivers of many ecosystem services we humans depend on. At the same time, the presence and effects of anthropogenic stress in the aquatic environment are multitude and ubiquitous. These include the omnipresence of chemical pollution such as the use of agricultural chemicals.


To relatively quickly assess the impacts of chemicals a standard risk assessment framework is in place. While valuable, the frameworks often lacks ecological realism. Researchers from Leiden University therefore experiment in outdoor freshwater experimental systems with natural food webs such as the “Levend Lab” (EN: “Living Lab”, https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/livinglab) to identify how biodiversity responds to the impacts of pesticides, fertilizers, invasive species and nanomaterials.


Using ecological theory, a large array of different experimental and statistical analytical methods are currently in practice to perform and analyze such experiments. The key challenge for the PhD candidate is to test these different forms of experimental and statistical analytical methods to identify stressor - ecosystem function relationships. The research will likely entail measuring different forms of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functionality followed by statistical modelling to infer causality of stressor impacts and their propagation through the ecosystem.


We invite prospective candidates to unravel the intricate network of species interactions between each other and their environment. The candidate will use new analytical methods and develops models and interpretation scenarios to identify how pollution impacts species and their role in ecosystem functionality.

**Key tasks:**

* *Perform* mesocosm pollution experiments in the ‘Levend Lab’ facility of Leiden University
* *Further develop* and test different types of statistical analyses at the community to ecosystem level
* *Advance* ecological theory by identifying the anthropological and natural drivers of species and their roles in ecosystems

**Selection criteria:**

* You should have an M.Sc. in a relevant field (environmental science, biology, ecology and/or ecotoxicology), but we also consider candidates from other related scientific fields.
* Experience with experimental field and laboratory skills and (aquatic) organism identifications are highly valued
* Strong background and interest in statistical analyses, data management, visualization and coding skills (in R, but Python also applies) is highly valued.
* You must be proficient in spoken and written English.
* You are a team player and have a collaborative attitude.


**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,800 staff and almost 6,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 150 FTE (including postdocs and PhD candidates) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

 **Vacature**

**Communicatiemedewerker GGD** **(24 uur)**

 **Hoe ziet jouw toekomstige werkdag eruit?**  

Je start de werkdag goed met een lekkere kop koffie. Samen met je collega’s praat je bij over het weekend. Maar niet te lang, want aan het begin van de ochtend heb je meteen de weekstart van de GGD. Samen met je communicatiecollega’s bespreek je welke gezondheidsonderwerpen je de komende periode uitlicht. Dit doe je aan de hand van de omgevingsscan waarop je aanhaakt bij de behoefte van de inwoners, de contentplanning en ons jaarplan.


Hierna ga je gelijk aan de slag met het maken van content. De nieuwe social mediacampagne moet namelijk vandaag worden ingepland. Jij weet als geen ander hoe je met creatieve content de doelgroep kan bereiken. Naast je eigen kennis en ervaring, gebruik je hierbij de data en resultaten van eerdere, gelijksoortige campagnes.


De tijd vliegt en voor je het weet is het lunchtijd. Je loopt een rondje met je collega’s om even de benen te strekken. Als je terugkomt start een online meeting met een projectleider over een nieuwe voorlichtingscampagne. Je stelt vragen over doel, doelgroep en adviseert vervolgens over middelen.


Na de meeting neem je de tijd om je mail bij te werken. Je ontving een vraag van een journalist. Samen met de inhoudsdeskundige die de woordvoering doet, formuleer je de antwoorden op de vragen. Later deze week begeleid je het persmoment. Het laatste uur voer je een maandelijkse analyse uit om het gebruikersgedrag op de websites in beeld te brengen. Dit geeft weer nieuwe inzichten om de website te optimaliseren. Voldaan klap je je laptop dicht en verheug je je op morgen. Want morgen is weer een nieuwe dag die totaal anders kan zijn!

**Wat ga je doen?**  

Binnen onze veiligheidsregio hebben we de unieke combinatie van gezondheid (GGD) én veiligheid (Brandweer, Crisisbeheersing). Als communicatiemedewerker richt jij je op operationele taken van de GGD. Jouw werkgebied is breed en omvat afgebakende, uitvoerende werkzaamheden waarbij je nauw samenwerkt en spart met je communicatiecollega's.


Daarnaast zijn we een crisisorganisatie, wat betekent dat je ook bereid bent deel te nemen aan een communicatiepiket tijdens crisissituaties. Gemiddeld ben je 8 tot 10 keer per jaar een week lang bereikbaar en beschikbaar voor communicatieve werkzaamheden tijdens crisissituaties. Dit doe je samen met andere collega's die piket hebben die week.

**Jouw taken:**

* Content creatie: realiseren van boeiend en inspirerende content voor onze online en offline kanalen.
* Verhalen vertellen: complexe info omzetten in begrijpelijke en pakkende verhalen die onze doelgroep raken en betrekken.
* Social media: beheren van social media kanalen, toffe posts maken en interactie aangaan met onze volgers.
* Content organiseren: campagnes plannen en coördineren die ons merk en werk in de spotlight zetten.
* Huisstijl bewaken: bewaken en versterken van onze huisstijl in alle communicatie-uitingen
* Media contacten: opbouwen en onderhouden van relaties met de media, en zorgen voor positieve publiciteit en zichtbaarheid.
* Data checken: communicatiekanalen en communicatiecampagnes analyseren en data gebruiken om onze strategieën te verbeteren.
* Samenwerken: met verschillende teams en vormgever om communicatieprojecten van start tot finish te brengen.

**Wat breng je mee?**

* Diploma in communicatie of een vergelijkbare studie.
* Ervaring met traditionele en moderne communicatiemiddelen en campagnes.
* Top skills voor het maken pakkende teksten en beelden waarmee je onze doelgroep raakt.
* Sterk in vormgeving en bekend met tools, zoals Canva.
* Creatief brein met scherp oog voor detail.
* Sterke verbale en schriftelijke communicatie.
* Zelfstarter met een proactieve mindset.
* Analytisch vermogen om social media en websitedata om te zetten in slimme(re) communicatie.
* Echte teamplayer die graag samenwerkt.
* Passie voor verhalen vertellen en het bouwen van een sterk merk.
* Coachende vaardigheden en het vermogen om collega's te begeleiden en afdelingen te ondersteunen bij hun communicatie.

**Jouw team:**  

Je werkt in een leuk en enthousiast communicatieteam met 12 collega’s. Een team dat grotendeels bestaat uit jonge professionals, maar ook met enkele collega’s die al langer in het vak zitten. We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**  

Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA. Je komt te werken in een crisisorganisatie vol afwisseling. De coronacrisis, vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne, het hoogwater van de Maas of een grote brand. Wij waren erbij betrokken. Als communicatiemedewerker zit je bij ons nooit stil.


Je kunt je eigen werktijden en werkplek bepalen. Wij werken vanuit vertrouwen waarbij vrijheden en verantwoordelijkheden hand in hand gaan. Er zijn dus volop mogelijkheden om je privé- en werksituatie met elkaar te combineren.


Wij geven je de kans om te werken bij een organisatie met meerdere interessante en uitdagende werkvelden en een divers takenpakket. Binnen ons team zijn verschillende specialisaties aanwezig, waar jij als communicatiemedewerker van kunt leren en aan bij kunt dragen. Je kunt je bij ons helemaal uitleven. Bij ons ben je in goede handen.

**Je krijgt ook:**

* Een aanstelling voor een jaar voor 24 uur per week, met uitzicht op een vaste aanstelling;
* De mogelijkheid om hybride te werken inclusief bijhorende thuiswerkvergoeding;
* Een bruto maandsalaris tussen € 3.010 en € 4.302 (schaal 8) bij een fulltime dienstverband van 36 uur, afhankelijk van ervaring;
* Mogelijkheden om jezelf te ontwikkelen via trainingen, cursussen en opleidingen;
* Alle faciliteiten om goed te kunnen werken, zoals een laptop en een telefoon;
* Een Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB). Het IKB is 18,63% van je brutoloon. Je kunt het IKB maandelijks naar eigen behoefte inzetten. Hiermee kun je korting krijgen bij een sportschool, een fiets aanschaffen of een extra opleiding volgen. Maar je mag het ook uit laten betalen of er extra vakantiedagen mee kopen

Je start de werkdag goed met een lekkere kop koffie. Samen met je collega’s praat je bij over het weekend. Maar niet te lang, want aan het begin van de ochtend heb je meteen de weekstart van de GGD. Samen met je communicatiecollega’s bespreek je welke gezondheidsonderwerpen je de komende periode uitlicht. Dit doe je aan de hand van de omgevingsscan waarop je aanhaakt bij de behoefte van de inwoners, de contentplanning en ons jaarplan.
  

  

Hierna ga je gelijk aan de slag met het maken van content. De nieuwe social mediacampagne moet namelijk vandaag worden ingepland. Jij weet als geen ander hoe je met creatieve content de doelgroep kan bereiken. Naast je eigen kennis en ervaring, gebruik je hierbij de data en resultaten van eerdere, gelijksoortige campagnes.
  

  

De tijd vliegt en voor je het weet is het lunchtijd. Je loopt een rondje met je collega’s om even de benen te strekken. Als je terugkomt start een online meeting met een projectleider over een nieuwe voorlichtingscampagne. Je stelt vragen over doel, doelgroep en adviseert vervolgens over middelen.
  

  

Na de meeting neem je de tijd om je mail bij te werken. Je ontving een vraag van een journalist . Samen met de inhoudsdeskundige die de woordvoering doet, formuleer je de antwoorden op de vragen. Later deze week begeleid je het persmoment. Het laatste uur voer je een maandelijkse analyse uit om het gebruikersgedrag op de websites in beeld te brengen. Dit geeft weer nieuwe inzichten om de website te optimaliseren. Voldaan klap je je laptop dicht en verheug je je op morgen. Want morgen is weer een nieuwe dag die totaal anders kan zijn!
  

  

**Wat ga je doen?**  

Binnen onze veiligheidsregio hebben we de unieke combinatie van gezondheid (GGD) én veiligheid (Brandweer, Crisisbeheersing). Als communicatiemedewerker richt jij je op operationele taken van de GGD. Jouw werkgebied is breed en omvat afgebakende, uitvoerende werkzaamheden waarbij je nauw samenwerkt en spart met je communicatiecollega's.
  

  

Daarnaast zijn we een crisisorganisatie, wat betekent dat je ook bereid bent deel te nemen aan een communicatiepiket tijdens crisissituaties. Gemiddeld ben je 8 tot 10 keer per jaar een week lang bereikbaar en beschikbaar voor communicatieve werkzaamheden tijdens crisissituaties. Dit doe je samen met andere collega's die piket hebben die week.
  

  

**Jouw taken:**

* Social media: beheren van social media kanalen, toffe posts maken en interactie aangaan met onze volgers.
* Content organiseren: campagnes plannen en coördineren die ons merk en werk in de spotlight zetten.
* Huisstijl bewaken: bewaken en versterken van onze huisstijl in alle communicatie-uitingen

* Data checken: communicatiekanalen en communicatiecampagnes analyseren en data gebruiken om onze strategieën te verbeteren.

**Wat breng je mee?**  

* Diploma in communicatie of een vergelijkbare studie.
* Ervaring met traditionele en moderne communicatiemiddelen en campagnes.
* Top skills voor het maken pakkende teksten en beelden waarmee je onze doelgroep raakt.
* Sterk in vormgeving en bekend met tools, zoals Canva.
* Creatief brein met scherp oog voor detail.
* Sterke verbale en schriftelijke communicatie.
* Zelfstarter met een proactieve mindset.
* Analytisch vermogen om social media en websitedata om te zetten in slimme(re) communicatie.
* Echte teamplayer die graag samenwerkt.
* Passie voor verhalen vertellen en het bouwen van een sterk merk.
* Coachende vaardigheden en het vermogen om collega's te begeleiden en afdelingen te ondersteunen bij hun communicatie.

  

**Jouw team:**  

Je werkt in een leuk en enthousiast communicatieteam met 12 collega’s. Een team dat grotendeels bestaat uit jonge professionals, maar ook met enkele collega’s die al langer in het vak zitten. We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.
  

  

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA. Je komt te werken in een crisisorganisatie vol afwisseling. De coronacrisis, vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne, het hoogwater van de Maas of een grote brand. Wij waren erbij betrokken. Als communicatiemedewerker zit je bij ons nooit stil.
  

  

Je kunt je eigen werktijden en werkplek bepalen. Wij werken vanuit vertrouwen waarbij vrijheden en verantwoordelijkheden hand in hand gaan. Er zijn dus volop mogelijkheden om je privé- en werksituatie met elkaar te combineren.

**Functieprofiel**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;

* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;

Dat doen we o.a. door het organiseren van vakwedstrijden. Jongeren laten ontdekken waar hun passie ligt, hun skills te vergroten, de kans geven om met vakmanschap te schitteren; daar zetten we ons elke dag met veel plezier voor in! We werken hiervoor veel samen met scholen en bedrijven.

Voor het team Marketing & Communicatie zijn we op zoek naar een enthousiaste en ervaren manager. Je hebt een brede ervaring op gebied van o.a. branding, projectmanagement en online marketing. Van nature beschik je over een coachende stijl van leidinggeven en maak je makkelijk contact met anderen.

Vertaal beleid naar de praktijk. En draag bij aan de informatievoorziening rond 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken per jaar.**


**Wat doe je als Informatiemanager bij IVO Rechtspraak?**
---------------------------------------------------------


Jouw werk is van grote invloed op de rechtspraak. En daarmee op het leven van mensen. Want de rechtspraak kan niet zonder goede informatie. En die moet voor álle betrokkenen eenvoudig beschikbaar zijn. Van rechters tot burgers die door een geschil of misdaad in een rechtszaak zijn verwikkeld. Jij speelt een centrale rol in die informatievoorziening. Een opdracht op niveau, waarbij de prioriteiten die jij stelt of laat stellen het verschil maken!


### **Hoe je werk eruitziet**


Ieder jaar zijn er zo’n 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken in Nederland. Binnen IVO Rechtspraak hebben we verschillende teams die zich bezighouden met informatievoorziening. In elk team stuurt een portefeuillehouder namens de business, met een rechtsgebied als focus: straf, civiel en bestuur, toezicht, familie en jeugd, Data en Registers en tot slot bedrijfsvoering. Jij bent de rechterhand van de portefeuillehouder en start bij het IV-team Bedrijfsvoering. De portefeuille Bedrijfsvoering levert generieke diensten aan Rechtspraak collega's en externe partijen, zoals burgers, rechtzoekenden, journalisten en ketenpartners. De portefeuille is onderverdeeld in de volgende vijf thema's waarbinnen alle verschillende applicaties van Bedrijfsvoering zijn ondergebracht; klantgerichte communicatie en kennisportalen, slim samenwerken en online zitten, creëren en delen van uitspraken, facilitering bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen en digitale informatiehuishouding


Samen met je collega-informatiemanagers breng jij in kaart welke informatie nodig is om rechtszaken en bedrijfsondersteunende processen optimaal te laten verlopen. Daar maak je voor jouw thema beleid op, ook voor de lange termijn. En je ziet toe op de uitvoering van dat beleid. Zo bouw je mee aan de digitale toekomst van de rechtspraak in ons land.


Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware twee talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.


Zit je als informatiemanager graag dicht bij het vuur? En wil je de richting van de rechtspraak mee helpen bepalen? Stuur dan direct je sollicitatie!

Job Squad was founded by a couple of young Danish entrepreneurs with a passion for recruitment and HR.

Both of these young mavericks came together with their shared experiences to create Job Squad, a personal recruitment agency with a corporate twist. Job Squad’s vision was to create career opportunities for Europeans across borders, that will strengthen and develop their personality and career diversity. By breaking down borders and bringing on a wide variety of clients and positions we try to make sure there’s a position and dream destination for everyone.


At Job Squad we like to think of ourselves as professionals without the formality - after all, we are here to help and make sure both job hunt and relocation are as seamless and supportive as possible. Furthermore, we are a big multinational team, living and working in many different countries, but working closely both in and between teams! An internship at Job Squad means that you will become an essential part of the team, and you will have tasks and responsibilities and we expect you to be proactive.

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.  

  

**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.

Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.

* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening.
