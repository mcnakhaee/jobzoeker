 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!

We believe that everyone should have equal access to opportunities and want to ensure we provide an inclusive experience, so do let us know if there is anything else we can do to support your application process.

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work.

**ABOUT US**

The Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) is seeking a creative and entrepreneurial candidate to join its offices in Groningen or Nairobi as a Climate Change Adaptation Economist.  



  

GCA is a leading international organization dedicated to addressing climate change and promoting adaptation action for resilient development. We collaborate with governments, International Financial Institutions (IFIs), businesses, and communities to develop and implement innovative solutions that strengthen resilience and support adaptation to climate change impacts.  



  

At GCA, you’ll contribute to transformative projects that make a lasting impact on global climate resilience. You’ll have the freedom to innovate and the support to bring your bold ideas to life. If you’re excited about creating meaningful change and building a sustainable future, we’d love to have you on our team.

GCA’s strategy in Africa is implemented under the flagship Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program (AAAP), launched by GCA and the African Development Bank (AfDB) to scale up adaptation efforts and mobilize finance for climate-resilient development in Africa. To date, GCA has integrated adaptation solutions into $9 billion worth of investments funded by IFIs across Africa. GCA’s work under the AAAP focuses on four pillars where investments in adaptation and resilience building can yield high economic dividends for African nations, including: Food security; Infrastructure and Nature-based Solutions; Youth entrepreneurship and adaptation jobs; and Adaptation finance.  



  

The R4I team conducts research to support GCA’s programmatic work and develops academic and training programs on adaptation to empower scholars and professionals as well as serving as an adaptation incubator to globalize the exchange of adaptation knowledge which would have otherwise remained geographically constrained.

You will delve into the critical linkages between infrastructure disruption and broader societal dimensions such as food security, livelihoods, and overall wellbeing. Your expertise will be key in identifying how infrastructure resilience directly affects international trade, national economies and community resilience, uncovering complex interdependencies and providing actionable insights for resilience strategies. Through your research you will play a significant role in comprehending and articulating the effects that infrastructure disruption or development can have on societal stability and progress with respect to climate adaptation.

* Manage and analyze large datasets, ensuring accuracy and relevance to the research questions.
* Contribute to the preparation of policy briefs and reports that articulate the economic rationale for climate adaptation strategies.
* Support the Senior Economist in advising on policy development, incorporating economic principles into practical adaptation actions.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

 Apply Now
Join ReBioClim, a Project Aiming to Pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in Four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.

Join ReBioClim, a project aiming to pilot Social-Ecologically Integrated Urban Stream Restoration in four European cities.


Job description


We are inviting applications for a 1,5-year position (0.8 FTE) as a postdoc researcher in the interdisciplinary project ReBioClim - Restoring urban streams to promote Biodiversity, Climate adaptation and to improve quality of life in cities. ReBioClim is an Interreg Central Europe project that brings together 12 partners around four urban stream restoration cases in Dresden (Germany), Poznan (Poland), Bratislava (Slovakia) and Jablonec nad Nisou (Czechia), with external expertise on spatial analysis and design from TU Delft.



Building on the tradition of the Department of Urbanism of designing and planning cities with water, as well as the involved research group's experience in urban riverspace analysis and design, the TU Delft team will conduct urban geospatial analyses considering the morphological, social, ecological and environmental particularities of urban stream corridors. Carried out as a spatial multi-criteria analysis in all case study locations, this activity will reveal how local spatial patterns influence stream restoration potentials and to what extent they are generic and thus transferrable. Conflicts (e.g., between traffic and ecological corridors) and synergies (e.g., low-impact recreation in a riparian zone) across the different layers of analysis will be highlighted.



TU Delft will also lead the joint development of a co-design workshop methodology. Following a multi- and mixed-method approach to data collection in the workshops, the research team will triangulate nuanced information on different facets of stream restoration and its perception by citizens. The co-design methodology will be set up in such a way that comparison and integration of information across the cases will be possible in subsequent activities. The workshop will be designed to engage citizens effectively and make their co-design experience enjoyable, insightful and empowering.



Moreover, TU Delft will contribute to the development of transferrable design principles for social-ecological integration that rely on the nature-based solutions collected or developed during the project. The integrative character of the design principles (e.g., how they meet social and ecological targets jointly) will be made explicit in the description of the principles. All principles will have an illustration that explains the essence of the proposed intervention and thus facilitates their uptake in implementation. After being evaluated and validated by experts, the principles will be incorporated into a best-practice guide and a handbook for integrated urban stream restoration.



In the context of these activities, your key responsibilities will be:


* Conducting geospatial analysis to describe the current and potential spatial conditions around the urban stream transformations targeted in the four cases.
* Contributing to the development of the co-design methodology and guiding other partners in applying this methodology.
* Contributing to the development of design principles, best practice guide and handbook together with consortium partners.
* Managing the raw and derived, spatial and non-spatial, data following the Data Management Plan and project-wide data agreements.
* Actively participating in in-person and online meetings and other knowledge exchange activities with consortium partners.
* Writing up project deliverables.
* Contributing to the publication of research findings in reputable peer-reviewed journals and present results in conferences and workshops.


You will be part of the Section of Urban Design in the Department of Urbanism at the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment.


Requirements


* A PhD degree in one or more of the following disciplines: urbanism, landscape architecture, urban studies, urban planning, human geography, or a related discipline.
* A strong and demonstrable interest in sustainable urban transformations instrumented by nature-based solutions, green-blue infrastructure and/or urban rivers/streams.
* A strong interest in design-driven research, preferably demonstrated with experience in developing or conducting design workshops.
* Excellent skills in geospatial analysis and spatial morphology, preferably in QGIS.
* Verbal and written working profficiency in English, including good writing skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed academic publications or by other relevant writing experience.
* Ability to work independently and in a result-oriented way.
* Availability to start in January 2025.


Nice-to-haves:


* Experience in conducting geospatial analysis in a programming environment such as R or Python.
* Knowledge of co-design workshop methodologies.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service.

**Background**


Within ING we make use of data science for a variety of use cases (such as improving financial health of our customers by transaction forecasting). The data science models which run in production all generate output this data needs to be delivered to different destination within ING. These destinations vary from data lakes and kafka topics to Cassandra datastores.


In the past a generic Interface format (GI) was developed as a one size fits all solution to standardize the output delivery for our data-scientists. Over time many models have adopted this interface but we are now facing challenges such as files which became too big or the throughput time is too long.

**The opportunity**


We would like to deep-dive into this topic by dedicating an intern as engineer to investigate our use cases and look for a future proof solution. This includes gathering information, do market research (buy vs built) and design / develop one or more prototypes together with our data-scientists data engineers.

**Team** **overview**


You, as an intern will join one of our data-engineering teams which support the ING data-scientists. The teams work on a variety of topics to maintain and evolve our data-analytics environment in Google Cloud.

* Located in our Amsterdam office.
* Mix of local and off-shore colleagues (so multiple nationalities)
* We work in agile teams based around Scrum and continuous delivery principles.
* Our teams work in hybrid mode, we work from home when possible and work from the office at least one day a week.
* We have 36 hour working weeks.

**Roles and responsibilities**


This assignment is about understanding and improving our way of distributing data-science model output. The current implementation of GI (Generic Interface) needs to be examined as well as our use cases and the industry standards available. The goal is to boost new alternatives and bring us further in achieving an excellent data-driven organization.

**Expected l****earnings**

You will be working in an environment with modern continuous delivery tools with people who have a continuous improvement mindset. Tools include Azure (CDaaS), Google GCP (Terraform, Vertex AI, BigQuery), NiFi for data flow management.


Working in a complex environment such as ING can be challenging and this is part of the learning and our people and teams are there to help you.


Communication and collaboration are key and this involves working closely together with domain experts such as data-engineers, data-scientists and machine learning engineers.

**Expected output**


An inventory of required features, an improved understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the current implementation and a redesign plus implementation plan (part of this can also contain a buy vs built decision or a vendor selection).


When time allows the output also consists of the implementation of a prototype solution.

**How to succeed**


You can succeed in this role by showing:

* a “can-do” mentality
* you are a “self starter” (pro-active)
* you speak out and like to challenge yourself and the people around you
* you have a background in IT, information management or similar
* experience and affinity with machine learning is very useful
* it helps if you like programming (python, java, scala) though this is not a show stopper

**Rewards and benefits**  

This is a great opportunity to train with highly skilled people who are experts in their field. You’ll do a lot and learn a lot –  

not only about your specialist area and the bank, but also about yourself and whether this type of environment is right for you.

  

You’ll also benefit from:

* Internship allowance of EUR 700/month for 36 hours (maximum)
* Compensation of travel costs
* Your own work laptop
* Hybrid working to blend home working for focus and office working for collaboration and co-creation

**Why?**

Every swipe, every like, every TikTok video we upload, every Zoom call we have, every Netflix video we watch, or everything we buy online is all processed and depends on… data centers. However, these data centers consume large amounts of energy due to the underlying technology we use every day all day.

**How?**

We have developed an AI-based analytics platform that captures the entire data center (DC) infrastructure—""from roof to room""—to bring the whole DC into a more optimal state. This platform saves energy, water, and scope 3 emissions while increasing reliability and sustainability in data centers across countries like Germany, France, the UK, Australia, and The Netherlands.

* Closely collaborate with our software engineers, MLOps engineers, and other stakeholders to ensure seamless integration of machine learning solutions into our products and services.

As such, this role represents a unique opportunity to have a broad impact on our organization and to contribute significantly to our technological evolution.

Job requirements

* Degree in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science , Mathematics or a Physics related field with abundant ML experience.
* 5+ years of proven experience as a Data Scientist, preferably in a SaaS product domain.
* 1+ years experience in hiring and managing a team of data scientists.

* Experience with one or more data science platforms like Dataiku, Databricks, DataRobot, etc.
* Strong programming skills in languages such as Python, Java, or Scala.

* Strong communication skills and ability to effectively convey technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
* Strong pre: experience with on-prem ML model training, inference and deployment for production-grade solutions.

**Perks**

* Working on making the world of data centers more sustainable

 Apply Now
***This position seeks a junior scientific programmer to further develop and integrate existing movici and multi-model.nl platforms and support the development of new (multi-)models of infrastructure interactions. The work will be done in close cooperation with PhDs, postdoc, senior experts on modeling theory and decision-making and practitioners from infrastructure providers. This position can potentially be turned into a PhD postion.***


Job description


Infrastructures provide the basis for many critical societal processes, from economy to education, from healthcare to housing and more. The infrastructures are increasingly interdependent on each other, from providing mutual services (like energy and data for mobility), via to providing alternative capacity (like rail, road and waterways), to competing for the same space (like in urban contexts).



Models and simulations are key tools for decision makers, allowing them to build, design, and plan infrastructures. As the need for integrated, cross system insight rises, current monodisciplinary and mono-sectoral models are increasingly unable to provide the required insights. A promising direction is multi-modelling, where different models and simulations are combined in an ecosystem of tools, that can be used and re-used in different configurations. The model ecosystem, and the socio-technical approach to modelling poses new methodological and technical challenges.



Models are instrumental for supporting the social process of decision-making, and are not a goal in themselves. Key model and software requirements will stem from the users and the social process that they are involved in. You, as a developer will be involved in these processes where needed, but are not expected to organize and manage them.



Work will consist of two main lines, platform development and model development support. Platform development involves integration of existing open-source platforms MOVICI and multi-model.nl, identifying new requirements and features from the users and developing them. Model development includes software implementation and general computing and data analysis support for researchers, modelers and modelling and simulation theorists. You may also be asked for advice on the most suitable software solutions, data structures, architectures, code redesign where necessary.



Goal of the position is the further development of the MOVICI and multi-model.nl platform towards a tailored tool for broad impact analysis in a complex stakeholder environment. The later means a lot of attention for describing and modeling scenario’s, a wide range and flexible approach towards evaluative criteria for these scenario’s, clear visualizations in space and time on scenario development, and interconnection with other modeling platforms.



We are looking for a person who enjoys (re)design and implementation ""done right"", with long term maintainability, reusability and generalizability being important, without losing sight of practicality. Willingness to work closely with domain experts and modeling theorists is paramount. Correct and clean representation and implementation of the relevant concepts is much more important than churning out features quickly. You will be working in research focused academic setting, so affinity with science, scientific methods and processes is useful.


Requirements


The software stack is organised around open source workflows: git, python, docker, Apache Airflow, linux shell and some C++. We also make use of REST interfaces and client-server architectures where relevant. Prior experience with these technologies is desirable but is explicitly not expected. We do expect solid python programming ability, high level of general computing skills and eagerness to learn more, as well as a good command of the English language. Dutch proficiency is desired but not necessary.



This is a junior position, and your interests, willingness to learn and team fit are much more important than prior experience with specific technologies.



We are seeking a recent graduate from a computer science/ computer engineering / programming and/or data science-oriented MSc program, but candidates with different background are also encouraged to apply. The position could in term be changed to a modeling and simulation focused PhD position.



We expect that you will take the initiative, be independent and can handle a high degree of freedom, especially in the technical domain. However, you will not be left alone to “figure it all out by yourself”. You will be part of a team that takes personal development and growth, mental health and neurodiversity seriously. You will be working closely with Dr. Ir. I Nikolic, and Prof. Dr. W. Veeneman.

Then we have an opportunity for you.

  



**Job Description**  

In the plastic packaging value chain, there is only limited information available on the plastics in that chain to assess circularity and recyclability goals, especially the use of post-consumer recyclates (PCR) in packaging.

  


Quality specifications, monitoring, and standardisation of materials are common in certain industries like chemistry and pharma but are, at this point, only in an infancy state in plastic waste management. A major challenge when it comes to mechanical recycling of plastics is that the quality of the material is not monitored throughout the whole process. Inline monitoring is however essential for predicting the final quality of PCR.

  


In the MoQuP-R project, we focus on the necessary quality monitoring tools and the application of existing models related to the prediction of recyclate quality in order to increase the use of PCR in packaging. In this project your responsibilities will entail:


* Review literature to identify potential inline analytical methods to monitor quality parameters.
* Adapt laboratory and/or offline analytical techniques to be used inline in polymer processing equipment.
* Propose and execute design changes to polymer processing equipment to enable inline measurements.
* Design experiments using polymer processing equipment and post-consumer plastics to apply and develop monitoring tools.
* Evaluate the different methods in relation to PCR quality.
* Manage a work package in the MoQuP-R project.
* Present your work at international conferences, MoQuP-R consortium meetings, and other events and write scientific papers for international peer-reviewed journals.
* Provide teaching assistance and/or supervision of researchers and students.

  




As a Postdoctoral Researcher you will work in the Circular Plastics team in the Faculty of Science and Engineering located at Brightlands Chemelot Campus in Geleen. You will become part of a young international research group, specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics with a strong polymer science background. Your will work together with Rudinei Fiorio on this exciting topic.

  


**Requirements**  

We expect you to have the following experience, knowledge, and skills:


* A PhD degree in mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, process analysis, mechatronics, or similar;
* Advanced skills in CAD and interfacing sensor data to analysis software (e.g. Python, Matlab, Simulink);
* Good knowledge on analytical techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, GCMS;
* Skills in polymer processing;
* Experience with industry collaborations is considered advantageous;
* Proficiency in both written and spoken English.

  




**What we offer**  

**As** **a Postdoctoral Researcher** **at the** **Faculty of Science & Engineering****, you will be employed by the most international university in the Netherlands, located in the beautiful city of Maastricht. In addition, we offer you:**


* Good employment conditions. The position is graded in scale 11 according to UFO profile Researche, with corresponding salary based on experience ranging from €4332,00 and €5929,00 gross per month (based on a full-time employment of 38 hours per week). In addition to the monthly salary, an 8.0% holiday allowance and an 8.3% year-end bonus apply.
* An employment contract for a period of 24 months with a scope of 1.0 FTE.
* At Maastricht University, the well-being of our employees is of utmost importance, we offer flexible working hours and the possibility to work partly from home if the nature of your position allows it. You will receive a monthly commuting and internet allowance for this. If you work full-time, you will be entitled to 29 vacation days and 4 additional public holidays per year, namely carnival Monday, carnival Tuesday, Good Friday, and Liberation Day. If you choose to accumulate compensation hours, an additional 12 days will be added.

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.
* Masters degree, PhD or equivalent experience in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, etc.).
* We prefer candidates with Deep Learning experience, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. Experience with TensorFlow is a plus.
* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).
* Excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal; the ability to convey your message to team members and other collaborators.

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.
* Masters degree, PhD or equivalent experience in a quantitative field (e.g. Computer Science, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Physics, etc.).
* We prefer candidates with Deep Learning experience, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. Experience with TensorFlow is a plus.
* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).
* Excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal; the ability to convey your message to team members and other collaborators.

Then this is the perfect job for you!
  
Knab was founded in 2012. We are an online bank, but one run by real people. We are known for being different because we want to do things differently. Simpler, smarter, and more affordable for our customers. By combining smart technology with a healthy dose of common sense, we create financial services that meet your needs. We add sublime, personal service to this, creating something unique in the financial sector.  

  

**Your role and responsibilities**  

Are you passionate about problem solving and combining the use of different tools in your daily work? And are you interested in the interest rate risk and enjoy improving processes? As a Senior ALM Specialist you will be responsible for managing and modelling interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) in a small and engaged team.  

  

Furthermore, the role will include at least the following:


* Managing the interest rate risk through hedging and designing optimal risk steering;
* Developing and refining interest rate related models (e.g. non-maturing deposits, cash flows, prepayments, mortgage pipeline, hedge accounting);
* Shaping decision-making, policies and analyses for senior management;
* Reporting the IRRBB and FX position to ALCO;
* Staying up-to-date with the latest changes in regulation (i.e. EBA, BCBS 239) related to IRRBB management;
* Enhancing reporting processes with regard to the automation and quality of the reported data;
* Assisting junior team members in their professional development.


The current interest rate environment and changes in EBA IRRBB regulation make it a very dynamic and exciting time to be part of a first-line of defence ALM team. The combination of the current economic climate, a flat-structured bank and a wide range of projects offer you a great opportunity to grow professionally and develop a holistic view on interest rate risk of the bank.  

  

**The team**  

The Asset and Liability Management & Methodology (ALM&M) team’s goal is to deliver on Knab’s strategy by optimizing the balance sheet of Knab. We do this by ensuring that the interest rate risk and funding positions of Knab are managed within the boundaries set in the strategies for those risks whilst not losing sight of the profitability of the bank.  

  

We believe in assigning ownership instead of tasks and, as a result, everyone within the ALM&M team gets the chance to own and be in the lead of a focus area within our team. This creates a flat structure which enables people to take initiative and develop their professional career on their own terms.  

  

On a personal side, we are a fun and multi-national team of curious and knowledgeable people. We perceive work as a challenge to improve ourselves and the bank. We like to work together and learn from each other through regular knowledge sharing sessions. We also enjoy spending time together outside of the work (e.g. having a drink or a game of padel.  

  

**Your profile**  

To be successful in this role, this is the kind of traits we have in mind:


* Completed masters degree in (Quantitative) Finance, Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics or similar;
* 5-7 years of relevant working experience in financial modelling, ALM or balance sheet management;
* Experience with Python, R, VBA (Excel) or C++ is a must, SQL is a plus;
* Experience with ALM / risk software solutions such as QRM or Ambit Focus is preferred;
* Ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and concise way;
* Self-starter with the ability, agility and motivation for self-learning;
* Excellent control of the English language, both written and verbally. Dutch is a bonus.


Did you know that according to research, women are less likely to apply than men when they don't meet all the job requirements? What a shame. Because, in our view, 'the perfect candidate' is a myth. So, if you have the drive to grow in aspects of this role, we look forward to your application.  

  

**This is Knab and this is what we offer you**  

Come as you are. Knab is an open workplace with positive vibes. We are inclusive of all nationalities, races and genders. We feel comfortable to bring our authentic whole selves to work and like you to do so too.  

  

If you come to work with us, Knab will become a significant part of your life. Therefore, we make sure the ambiance is just as exciting as your job. If you have any questions regarding this role or the process, please feel free to reach out to us.

=====================

* **We are on a mission** to make programming biology easy. We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.
* We're an **experienced team**. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!
* We're focused on building the **best possible team culture**. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.
* We offer **top of the market** salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.


**Responsibilities**:


As a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:

* Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools
* Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations
* Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process
* Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain
* Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.
* Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem

**Need to haves**
=================

* Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills
* You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.
* You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer\*, or even implement a UI plugin.
* You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.
* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development

Daarna spar je met je directe collega over een analyse waar zij aan werkt. Vervolgens controleer je een syntax van een collega uit een ander team. Nadat je bent opgehaald door je collega's om samen te lunchen, werk je 's middags verder aan een analyse over drugsgebruik onder uitgaande jongeren. Voordat je naar huis gaat beoordeel je voor een andere collega of de methode en resultaten van een nieuw rapport goed zijn beschreven. Zie jij dit helemaal voor je? Twijfel niet en solliciteer bij ons!

**Hoeveel impact wil jij maken?**

Werken bij het Trimbos-instituut betekent impactvol werk doen met meerwaarde voor de maatschappij. Binnen het Trimbos-instituut werken we hard aan een mentaal gezonder Nederland. Het programma EpiDEM (Epidemiologie, Data, Evaluatie & Monitoring) levert hiervoor de basis door onderzoek te doen naar trends en ontwikkelingen in mentale gezondheid en middelengebruik van Nederlandse jongeren en volwassenen. We hebben een brede expertise op het gebied van monitoring-onderzoek, (economische) evaluaties en methoden en technieken van onderzoek. Het team wordt instituut-breed gevraagd voor methodologisch advies en biedt ondersteuning bij dataverzameling en datamanagement. We schrijven artikelen over mentale gezondheid, adviseren de overheid en zijn zichtbaar in de media. We zijn trots op deze belangrijke bijdrage aan het Nederlandse beleid voor mentale gezondheid! Ons werk maakt een wezenlijk verschil in de samenleving.

**Waar kom je te werken?**

De cultuur binnen het Trimbos-instituut wordt ervaren als professioneel, informeel, open en warm. Medewerkers voelen vrijheid en regelruimte. Ideeën en eigen inbreng worden zeer gewaardeerd. Zo kan er meegedacht worden over verschillende onderwerpen binnen de organisatie.

Het team waarin je komt te werken is enthousiast en gezellig. Binnen ons programma werken zo’n 15 (wetenschappelijk) medewerkers. Eén ding hebben ze allemaal gemeen: de passie om blijvende impact te maken op mentale gezondheid en middelengebruik.

Binnen EpiDEM vorm je samen met onze Research Datamanager en een junior onderzoeksmedewerker Research Support. Dit team adviseert en ondersteunt alle collega’s binnen het Trimbos-instituut in onderzoeken rondom mentale gezondheid en middelen. We ondersteunen bij zowel kwalitatief als kwantitatief onderzoek, waarbij de nadruk op kwantitatieve onderzoeken ligt.

**Dit doe jij als Specialist Onderzoeksmethoden en Data-Analyse**

* Je bent expert, adviseur en aanspreekpunt voor het doen van wetenschappelijk onderzoek binnen het Trimbos-instituut. Van onderzoeksvraag tot een study design met de juiste methoden en analyses: je collega’s binnen het Trimbos-instituut kunnen voor advies bij jou terecht.
* Je voert -naast je adviesrol- ook zelf onderzoekswerkzaamheden uit voor verschillende projecten, met name kwantitatieve analyses.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van methodologische ontwikkelingen relevant voor het veld en past deze toe waar ze meerwaarde hebben.
* Je geeft regelmatig voorlichting en training aan collega’s over (kwantitatief) onderzoek en reproduceerbaar werken.

**Dit is jouw kracht**

Jij hebt brede kennis en ervaring in (kwantitatieve) onderzoeksmethoden en analyses, en ziet jezelf als een expert op dat terrein. Deze kennis en ervaring blijkt uit je opleiding en werkervaring. Je bent wetenschappelijk opgeleid met een achtergrond in de Epidemiologie, Gezondheidswetenschappen of een andere, vergelijkbare richting. Het is een pré als je gepromoveerd bent. Je hebt plezier in het hele proces van onderzoek, denk daarbij aan het formuleren van onderzoeksvragen, het uitdenken van geschikte methoden bij verschillende vraagstellingen, het uitvoeren van power analyses, steekproeftrekkingen en het uitvoeren van complexe en minder complexe statistische analyses. Je kunt goed werken met R, en bij voorkeur ook met SPSS en/of STATA. Ervaring met kwalitatieve analyses, implementatieonderzoek en/of participatief onderzoek (zoals co-creatie) is een pré. Je bent communicatief sterk en kan complexe methoden en analyses begrijpelijk uitleggen aan minder ervaren collega’s. Je kunt goed zelfstandig werken, maar ook in een team en stelt je laagdrempelig en klantgericht op naar de collega's. Tot slot is je beheersing van Nederlands en Engels in woord en schrift uitstekend.

De ideale kandidaat heeft een goed inzicht in de detailhandel, sterke analytische vaardigheden en ervaring met het werken met grote datasets.


Jouw werkveld is zeer dynamisch, maar gaat over het algemeen gepaard met taken als:  

Gegevensverzameling en -verwerking: gegevens verzamelen, opschonen en voorbewerken uit verschillende bronnen, waaronder verkooppuntsystemen, CRM, e-commerceplatforms en externe gegevensbronnen.


Datavisualisatie: Creëer duidelijke en effectieve datavisualisaties om complexe inzichten over te brengen aan niet-technische belanghebbenden.  

Experimenteren: Ontwerp en voer experimenten uit om hypothesen te testen en modellen te valideren. Implementeer testmaatregelen om de impact van verschillende strategieën te evalueren.


Prestatiemonitoring: monitor en evalueer de prestaties van modellen en algoritmen, en breng zo nodig aanpassingen aan om de nauwkeurigheid en efficiëntie te verbeteren.  

Onderzoek: Blijf op de hoogte van de nieuwste ontwikkelingen op het gebied van datawetenschap en machine learning, en pas deze kennis toe om de datamogelijkheden van de organisatie te verbeteren. Een voorbeeld van een use case kan verkoopvoorspelling zijn (d.w.z. voorspellende modellen bouwen om verkopen te voorspellen, trends te identificeren en voorraadniveaus of locatieplanning te optimaliseren).


Samenwerking: werk nauw samen met marketing-, verkoop-, operationele en financiële teams om hun databehoeften te begrijpen en analytische ondersteuning te bieden.

Onder de noemer ‘Alles is data’ komen alle typen data geïntegreerd beschikbaar door middel van een uniforme set van zoek- en analysefunctionaliteiten. De data komt uit een groot aantal in- en externe bronnen, die verwerkt wordt in een gedistribueerde en functioneel modulaire omgeving. Je bedenkt en realiseert samen met collega’s uit verschillende organisatieonderdelen datascience-oplossingen voor vraagstukken uit de politiepraktijk. Je draagt bij aan de gezamenlijke zorg voor de daadwerkelijke implementatie zodat het product geborgd wordt binnen de politieorganisatie.

Je komt te werken bij het Team Business Intelligence van BI&K; een klein team van professionals, ambitieus en volop in ontwikkeling. Het team houdt zich bezig met het genereren van de juiste informatie uit (grote hoeveelheden) data, brengt deze informatie samen en levert een bijdrage aan het komen tot voorspellingen en samenhang. We leveren een belangrijke bijdrage aan de innovatie binnen de landelijke intelligenceorganisatie en daarmee ook de DRIO. Een goede aansluiting bij de thema's van de DRIO spreekt voor zich. Denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan contraterrorisme, extremisme en radicalisering (CTER), ondermijning, excessief geweld, openbare orde en veiligheid, forensische opsporing, bewaken & beveiligen en cyber. Verder heeft BI&K een belangrijke rol in het verkrijgen van een actueel veiligheidsbeeld dat de eenheid in staat stelt dynamisch te sturen.

Je hebt een open en constructieve houding gericht op het verbinden van het data(science) domein met het werk wat door de collega’s in blauw, rechercheurs en informatiespecialisten wordt uitgevoerd. Om je collega’s mee te nemen in de mogelijkheden van datascience stel je de juiste vragen, waarbij je tactvol handelt en duidelijk communiceert. Je onderscheidt gemakkelijk hoofd- en bijzaken en brengt informatie uit diverse bronnen met elkaar in verband. Analyses kun je omzetten in concrete oplossingen en feiten kun je helder en gestructureerd vastleggen en presenteren. Je signaleert kansen en bent alert op trends, ontwikkelingen en jurisprudentie en regelgeving. Je kunt zelfstandig werken waarbij je proactief op zoek gaat naar nieuwe mogelijkheden en kansen. Je bent geduldig, vastberaden, nieuwsgierig en toekomstgericht.

**Wat je gaat doen**
--------------------


Je levert een belangrijke bijdrage in het onderzoek naar de mogelijkheden van een nieuw Kaderrichtlijn Water beoordelingssysteem voor vis met behulp van DNA-techniek. Alle vissen laten sporen van DNA achter in hun omgeving en de techniek staat daarom bekend als 'environmental DNA' ofwel eDNA. Met een nieuwe beoordelingssystematiek met DNA-techniek is de verwachting dat dit goedkoper en betrouwbaarder is om de kwaliteit van de visstand in de Nederlandse oppervlaktewaterlichamen in beeld te brengen dan hetvigerende beoordelingssysteem gebaseerd op vangstmethoden beschreven in het Handboek Hydrobiologie , zoals fuiken, zegen, ankerkuil en electro-visserij. Dit onderzoek voer je samen uit met het projectteam Maatlat Onderzoek Vis E-DNA (MOVE). Verder zul je samenwerken met praktijkpartners, marktpartijen en kennisinstituten in binnen- en buitenland aan het beoordelingssysteem van de toekomst.

**De functie omvat verder de volgende activiteiten:**

* je gaat bijdragen in een hecht en creatief onderzoeksteam aan de opzet van het onderzoeksprogramma;
* je verzamelt eDNA-monsters door heel Nederland en daarbuiten, en verwerkt de resultaten tot een ecologische database;
* door statistische analyses uit te voeren en grafisch weer te geven, toets je de relatie tussen biologische kwaliteit en omgevingsvariabelen;
* je vertaalt onderzoeksresultaten naar concrete bevindingen en conclusies en ondersteunt bij het organiseren van co-creatiesessies en presentaties;
* je hebt ambitie om de resultaten wetenschappelijk te publiceren\*;
* je staat open voor het uitvoeren van onderwijsactiviteiten, zoals het begeleiden van studenten en het geven van gastlessen en het overdragen van kennis over eDNA bemonsteren en analyseren.
* Afhankelijk van achtergrond, ervaring en interesse behoort het uitvoeren van een promotie-onderzoek, netwerkvorming werkveld en uitbouwen van (nieuwe)onderzoekslijnen zeker tot de mogelijkheden.

Then this is the perfect job for you!
  
Knab was founded in 2012. We are an online bank, but one run by real people. We are known for being different because we want to do things differently. Simpler, smarter, and more affordable for our customers. By combining smart technology with a healthy dose of common sense, we create financial services that meet your needs. We add sublime, personal service to this, creating something unique in the financial sector.  

  

**Your role and responsibilities**  

Are you passionate about problem solving and combining the use of different tools in your daily work? And are you interested in the interest rate risk and enjoy improving processes? As a Senior ALM Specialist you will be responsible for managing and modelling interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) in a small and engaged team.  

  

Furthermore, the role will include at least the following:


* Managing the interest rate risk through hedging and designing optimal risk steering;
* Developing and refining interest rate related models (e.g. non-maturing deposits, cash flows, prepayments, mortgage pipeline, hedge accounting);
* Shaping decision-making, policies and analyses for senior management;
* Reporting the IRRBB and FX position to ALCO;
* Staying up-to-date with the latest changes in regulation (i.e. EBA, BCBS 239) related to IRRBB management;
* Enhancing reporting processes with regard to the automation and quality of the reported data;
* Assisting junior team members in their professional development.


The current interest rate environment and changes in EBA IRRBB regulation make it a very dynamic and exciting time to be part of a first-line of defence ALM team. The combination of the current economic climate, a flat-structured bank and a wide range of projects offer you a great opportunity to grow professionally and develop a holistic view on interest rate risk of the bank.  

  

**The team**  

The Asset and Liability Management & Methodology (ALM&M) team’s goal is to deliver on Knab’s strategy by optimizing the balance sheet of Knab. We do this by ensuring that the interest rate risk and funding positions of Knab are managed within the boundaries set in the strategies for those risks whilst not losing sight of the profitability of the bank.  

  

We believe in assigning ownership instead of tasks and, as a result, everyone within the ALM&M team gets the chance to own and be in the lead of a focus area within our team. This creates a flat structure which enables people to take initiative and develop their professional career on their own terms.  

  

On a personal side, we are a fun and multi-national team of curious and knowledgeable people. We perceive work as a challenge to improve ourselves and the bank. We like to work together and learn from each other through regular knowledge sharing sessions. We also enjoy spending time together outside of the work (e.g. having a drink or a game of padel.  

  

**Your profile**  

To be successful in this role, this is the kind of traits we have in mind:


* Completed masters degree in (Quantitative) Finance, Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics or similar;
* 5-7 years of relevant working experience in financial modelling, ALM or balance sheet management;
* Experience with Python, R, VBA (Excel) or C++ is a must, SQL is a plus;
* Experience with ALM / risk software solutions such as QRM or Ambit Focus is preferred;
* Ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and concise way;
* Self-starter with the ability, agility and motivation for self-learning;
* Excellent control of the English language, both written and verbally. Dutch is a bonus.


Did you know that according to research, women are less likely to apply than men when they don't meet all the job requirements? What a shame. Because, in our view, 'the perfect candidate' is a myth. So, if you have the drive to grow in aspects of this role, we look forward to your application.  

  

**This is Knab and this is what we offer you**  

Come as you are. Knab is an open workplace with positive vibes. We are inclusive of all nationalities, races and genders. We feel comfortable to bring our authentic whole selves to work and like you to do so too.  

  

If you come to work with us, Knab will become a significant part of your life. Therefore, we make sure the ambiance is just as exciting as your job. If you have any questions regarding this role or the process, please feel free to reach out to us.

**De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie!**

**Wie zoeken wij?**

Voor ons hoofdkantoor in Amersfoort zoeken wij per direct een AI Solutions Developer.

In deze rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verkennen en implementeren van de mogelijkheden van generative AI, zoals ChatGPT, om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren.

Je hebt een relevante WO-opleiding afgerond of bijna afgerond, zoals Informatica of Data Science, en beschikt over aantoonbare kennis en interesse op het gebied van AI, machine learning en data-analyse. Daarnaast heb je sterke analytische vaardigheden en ben je in staat om complexe technische problemen op te lossen. Ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python, R of Java is een vereiste, evenals kennis van cloud computing en ervaring met platforms zoals AWS, Azure of Google Cloud.

Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief samen te werken in een team zijn van essentieel belang. Je bent proactief, leergierig en kunt goed omgaan met veranderingen en uitdagingen. Daarnaast heb je een sterke drive om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en ICT-management.

**Wat ga je doen?**

Deze functie is nieuw binnen Lab21, wat betekent dat je een grote invloed hebt op de invulling ervan. Je zult een onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren. Als Junior ICT Manager speel je een belangrijke rol bij het implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen binnen ons bedrijf. Je werkt nauw samen met verschillende teams om de behoeften van de organisatie in kaart te brengen en technologische oplossingen aan te dragen. Je analyseert en optimaliseert bestaande systemen en processen en identificeert kansen om AI-technologieën toe te passen.

**Plaats in de organisatie:**

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

**Interesse?**

Stuur ons dan je CV met motivatie.

Wil jij hier een bijdrage aan leveren? Reageer dan snel!’*

  

– Peter van Dyck – teammanager Energie- opwek & warmtenetten

  

Voor een ambitieus afstudeerproject zijn wij op zoek naar een analytisch sterke hbo’er. De kern van deze opdracht is het ontwikkelen van een geavanceerde tool die gebruikmaakt van o.a. big data, machine learning digital twins en AI om bestaande/draaiende warmtepomp/WKO installaties te evalueren en optimaliseren. De tool zal de operationele prestaties van deze installaties vergelijken met de oorspronkelijke (theoretisch) bepaalde energetische rendementen en op basis van deze vergelijking verbeterpunten identificeren.

  

De ontwikkelde tool moet in staat zijn om complexe datasets te analyseren, patronen te herkennen en aanbevelingen te doen voor het bijsturen van de bedrijfsvoering. Hoewel de tool uiteindelijk gevalideerd zal worden met behulp van een casus, ligt de primaire focus op de ontwikkeling van de tool. Je gaat aan de slag met de volgende taken:

  

* Ontwerpen en ontwikkelen van een tool die grote hoeveelheden data kan verwerken en analyseren
* Toepassen van machine learning algoritmes en AI-technieken om inzichten te genereren
* Creëren van een gebruiksvriendelijke interface voor de interpretatie van de analyse-uitkomsten in Skysparks
* Ontwikkelen van een validatiemethodiek om de tool te testen met realistische data
* Samenwerken met experts om de tool af te stemmen op de behoeften van de utiliteitsbouw en de industrie
* Documenteren van het ontwikkelproces en de technische specificaties van de tool
* Presenteren van de ontwikkelde tool en de bevindingen aan belanghebbenden

  

Je maakt kennis met het bedrijf. Je neemt deel aan (team/kennis)overleggen en je kunt mee naar klantgesprekken. Uiteraard word je begeleid door een collega. Spreekt jou dit aan en ben jij op zoek naar een stage waar je kennis en ervaring kan opdoen voor een periode van minimaal 20 weken? Reageer dan nu en wij maken graag kennis met je!

### **Dit is wat jij meebrengt**

  

* Hbo studerend richting Werktuigbouwkunde, Elektrotechniek of vergelijkbaar;
* Ervaring met programmeren in talen zoals Python, R of MATLAB;
* Kennis van machine learning, data-analyse en AI-principes;
* Vermogen om complexe technische concepten te vertalen naar praktische oplossingen;
* Sterke analytische vaardigheden en een systematische aanpak van problemen;
* Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en de mogelijkheid om zowel zelfstandig als in teamverband te werken.

### **Dit is wat je van ons kunt verwachten**

  

* Je werkt aan uitdagende projecten die er echt toe doen
* Een moderne en hybride werkomgeving die bruist, verschillen omarmt en persoonlijk leiderschap stimuleert
* Ruime ontwikkelmogelijkheden om te blijven groeien
* Een hecht team met de beste mensen
* Veel vertrouwen, steun en een helpende hand

Deze onderhoudsopgave biedt de kans om onze infrastructuur te verduurzamen en klaar te maken voor de toekomst, inclusief klimaatverandering. Deze taak vereist inzet van dienstonderdeel Water Verkeer en Leefomgeving (WVL). WVL brengt specifieke kennis in op het gebied van grondwater, klimaat, duurzaamheid, milieu, veiligheid en scheepvaart, en verbreedt deze door middel van dataverzameling en modellen. Wil jij hier een bijdrage aan leveren als adviseur grondwater? Lees dan snel verder.



Hoe jij bijdraagt in jouw rol



Grondwater is cruciaal voor de ondergrond waarop Rijkswaterstaat zijn netwerken bouwt en onderhoudt. Het is onlosmakelijk verbonden met ons werk en het borgen van grondwaterrisico’s is essentieel. Bij aanleg, beheer en onderhoud van het hoofdwegennet, hoofdvaarwegennet en hoofdwatersysteem kunnen ingrepen grondwatereffecten veroorzaken die invloed hebben op de omgeving.



Als versterking van de WVL-organisatie breng jij jouw technisch-inhoudelijke expertise op het gebied van grondwater in. Je past jouw kennis toe binnen het bredere kader van assetmanagement en sluit aan bij nieuwe werkwijzen vanuit de vernieuwingsopgave, zoals de productiestraten van de Werf (onze landelijke projectorganisatie van PPO/GPO/CIV) en het werken met leeropgaven.



Jij adviseert over onderzoeken voor diverse projecten binnen Rijkswaterstaat. Je formuleert specificaties en toetst de werkzaamheden van opdrachtnemers. Daarnaast werk je aan kennisontwikkeling via standaarden, innovaties en modellen, in samenwerking met collega’s, marktpartijen en kennisinstellingen zoals Deltares.



Het uitvoeren van berekeningen met grondwatermodellen behoort tot jouw kerntaken, evenals het beheer en onderhoud van deze modellen. Bovendien adviseer en borg je grondwatermeetnetten, waarmee je een cruciale rol speelt in het veilig en effectief beheren van onze infrastructuur.



Dit is waar jij voldoening uit haalt



Jij haalt er voldoening uit om beleid en kennis naar de praktijk te vertalen en vice versa. Je adviseert graag over onderzoeken voor aanlegprojecten en beheer- en onderhoudswerkzaamheden, en haalt energie uit het toepassen van jouw inhoudelijke kennis.



Je voelt je thuis in een team waar gedrevenheid en inhoudelijke kennis centraal staan. Tegelijkertijd is er vanuit de Vernieuwingsopgave een grote behoefte aan het vertalen van doelen en strategieën naar concrete projecten. Dit doe je in nauwe samenwerking met andere afdelingen binnen Water, Verkeer en Leefomgeving, de uitvoeringsdiensten GPO en PPO, en de Rijkswaterstaat regio’s waar vernieuwingsprojecten plaatsvinden. Hierdoor bouw je een breed netwerk op binnen Rijkswaterstaat.



Binnen je team heb je veel contacten met de regio’s en projecten van Rijkswaterstaat. Het verbinden van zowel mensen als inhoud is jouw tweede natuur.



Wat wij aan jou waarderen



Je bent op de eerste plaats inhoudelijk sterk op het gebied van geohydrologie (onder meer grondwatermonitoring, tijdreeksanalyse en grondwatermodellering). Met jouw uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden stem jij regelmatig en efficiënt af met collega’s, medeoverheden en andere partijen binnen en buiten Rijkswaterstaat. Je kunt aantoonbaar laten zien dat je resultaat- en samenwerkingsgericht bent. Je pakt makkelijk zaken op en bent ondernemend.



Je weet complexe materie helder en eenvoudig uit te leggen aan anderen, zowel in overleggen als op papier. Ook weet je snel tot de kern van complexe opgaven door te dringen. Daarnaast heb je aantoonbaar inhoudelijke ervaring in het grondwaterwerkveld. Ervaring met grondwatermonitoring, tijdreeksanalyse (PASTAS, Menyanthes), BRO en grondwatermodellen (NHI, MODFLOW/IMOD) zien wij als een pre. Ook ervaring met programmeren (bv. Python, R), en kennis van de RWS werkwijzen (bv. IPM rollenmodel) en systematieken (zoals systems engineering) is een pre.

**PhD position in Social Psychology on ‘Behavioral change and collective action for climate action and energy transition'**  


School: Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences  

Department: Social Psychology  

Location: Tilburg  

Monthly full-time gross salary: €2.770 to a maximum of €3.539 gross per month for full time employment  

Full time equivalent: 0,8 FTE (32 hours per week)  

Duration of employment contract: 12 months, followed by 48 months  

Start date: October 1, 2024 (sooner or later upon mutual agreement)  

Closing date vacancy: August 30, 2024  

  

**Description of the PhD project**  

Human behavior plays an important role in climate change, and can thus also make a significant positive contribution to climate action and the energy transition. In the debate about climate action and the energy transition, there is a discourse on individual action and behavioral change on the one hand, and a discourse on collective action, institutional change, and social innovation on the other. The former is about changes in lifestyle to reduce one's carbon footprint, including insulating one's home, installing solar panels and a heat pump, and buying an electric car. The latter is about changes in policy and legislation to meet climate and energy goals, through collectively organized solutions such as heat grids, but also about energy communities that enable collective and citizen-driven energy actions to support climate action and the energy transition.  

Rarely, these discourses are connected. Indeed, they are sometimes even perceived – and portrayed – as conflicting. This disconnection may, however, have serious implications for the effectiveness of climate action and the energy transition, and come at the expense of social equity and inclusion. There thus is a need for a synthesis, substantiated by interdisciplinary research in the social and behavioral sciences.  

This project hence aims to embrace both perspectives, by investigating the underlying logics of individual and collective action, and notably the ways through which the divide between individual and collective action can be counteracted. How can individual climate action and behavioral change for the energy transition be stimulated, whilst also organizing collective action and bringing about institutional change and social innovation? Addressing this question is urgent and important for scholars and societal stakeholders (e.g., local and regional governments, grid operators, consumer organizations) alike, and may contribute to both a better understanding of the role of human behavior in climate action and the energy transition as well as better informed policy and legislation backing individual and collective action.  


**Description of the Academic Collaborative Center for Climate and Energy**
The candidate will be embedded in the Department of Social Psychology within the School of Social and Behavioral Sciences (TSB). In addition, the research of the PhD project will take place within the context of the Academic Collaborative Center (ACC) for Climate and Energy, which is an interdisciplinary and university-wide center within Tilburg University. In the ACC, we study the societal dimension of climate action and the energy transition, including the social, psychological, legal, economic and political challenges encountered throughout the energy transition and in the achievement of climate goals. We work together with societal partners, including public institutions, industry, and other knowledge institutes, to map the problems encountered in the energy transition and to develop innovative solutions. As the ACC is a cross-faculty collaboration, you are expected to work with academics from other departments, faculties and institutions, as engaging in team science is core to our approach. The PhD project furthermore involves close transdisciplinary collaboration with non-academic partners such as local and regional governments, grid operators and consumer groups.  


**Your responsibilities**  

The main tasks will include:
* Writing a PhD thesis
* Planning and executing data collection (both secondary data and new data)
* Setting up experiments (lab, online or field) and surveys
* Executing basic and advanced data analysis
* Preparing scientific articles to be published in international journals
* Presenting at national and international scientific conferences
* Active participation in the Department of Social Psychology (e.g., by attending lecture series and departmental meetings).
* Active participation in the Academic Collaborative Center for Climate and Energy (e.g., by engaging with other researchers and societal partners).

  


**What you contribute**  

Tilburg University seeks candidates with knowledge, skills, and character. We are curious about your contribution. We think you should have the following qualities for this position:  


We are looking for a highly motivated and curious PhD candidate. Candidates ideally have a relevant academic background in (social) psychology or another behavioral science discipline relevant to the project and are in possession of a master’s or research master’s degree (or expect to obtain such a degree in the near future). We are looking for candidates who have:  


* An interest in conducting interdisciplinary research on the topic of behavioral change and collective action in the energy transition
* Demonstrated capacities to conduct quantitative research
* Advanced research skills (for example, experimental design, survey design, preregistration and other Open Science practices) and data analytical abilities (for example, meta-analysis, power-analysis, multilevel regression modeling)
* In-depth knowledge of statistical and programming tools (e.g., R, Stata, SPSS, Qualtrics)
* Proficiency in English at an academic level, including strong writing skills
* Excellent communication and cooperation skills and the willingness to work in a team
* Commitment to open science

  


**Increasing your value**  

With us, you will find everything you need to maximize your potential and development. We offer excellent facilities and support for research, education, and making societal impact. In all three of these areas, we “recognize and reward” you in line with national university aspirations. Read more about careers at Tilburg University and personal development here.  


**Your terms of employment**  

Your valuable contribution will be rewarded with attractive benefits and sufficient attention to work-life balance. Our offer includes:
* A position based on 0,8 FTE (32 hours per week)
* This is a vacancy that is temporarily funded on the basis of the National Education Program, in accordance with Article 2.3 paragraph 6 sub c of the CLA for Dutch Universities. You will be given a temporary employment contract for the duration of 12 months.

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=891742d8d1bc5cc1,indeed,Postdoc position Impact of farm management on soil health at the European scale,Wageningen University & Research,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Wageningen-University-&-Research,"Wageningen, GE, NL","parttime, fulltime",2024-07-18,,,,,False,,,"julian.helfenstein@wur.nl, noorien.abbas@wur.nl","**Are you fascinated to work with data from thousands of agricultural fields from all over Europe? Do you want to contribute to finding solutions for how farm management can improve soil health, and understand better how soil health impacts crop yield stability? Are you not afraid of big data and next level statistics? Then Soil Geography and Landscape Group is looking for you!**  

  

Recently there has been an enormous increase in the availability of soil data. LUCAS Soil strategically monitors soil properties in three-year intervals at roughly 20’000 locations throughout Europe, and the EU is in the process of passing a directive on soil monitoring and resilience that would further strengthen soil monitoring in Europe. The on-going EU-wide soil monitoring has already greatly improved knowledge of spatial and temporal dynamics of soils, at the continental scale. However, since there is no information on land management in the survey, the data has so far not been able to answer urgent questions on how farm management affects soil properties, and vice versa, how soil health impacts crop yield.  

  

In this postdoc you will work with a unique dataset of farm management data from hundreds of thousands of farms across Europe and link it with European soil monitoring data to answer the following questions:* Can spatial and temporal patterns in farm management intensity explain observed changes in soil properties, using the example of soil organic carbon stocks?
* In turn, how do indicators of soil health impact crop yield stability in the face of weather extremes?


Your duties and responsibilities include leading data analysis and writing of scientific publications, supervising master thesis students, and communicating results to non-academic stakeholders. You will work in the Soil Geography and Landscape Group, an interdisciplinary team of early and more advanced career scientists, and have the opportunity to develop networks within Wageningen University and Research and internationally.  

  

This position is for 2 years, the intended starting date is from 1 October 2024 (or on agreement). Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:* sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
* working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;
* the option to accrue additional compensation / holiday hours by working more, per week;
* there is a strong focus on vitality, and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
* a fixed December bonus of 8.3%;
* excellent pension scheme.


In addition to these first-rate employee benefits, you will of course receive a good salary. Depending on your experience, we offer a competitive gross salary of between €3.226 and €5.090 for a full-time working week of 38 hours, in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreements for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU) (scale 10. Additionally, a contract for 0.8 FTE can be discussed.  

  

Wageningen University & Research encourages internal advancement opportunities and mobility with an internal recruitment policy. There are plenty of options for personal initiative in a learning environment, and we provide excellent training opportunities. We are offering a unique position in an international environment with a pleasant and open working atmosphere.  

  

You are going to work at the greenest and most innovative campus in Holland, and at a university that has been chosen as the “Best University” in the Netherlands for the 19th consecutive time.  

  

**Coming from abroad**

Ben jij een kinderfysiotherapeut die gewend is om buiten de kaders van het normale denken te opereren. Heb jij ervaring met Artificial Intelligence (AI) en krijg je energie van het creëren van (technische) oplossingen voor complexe praktijk problemen.


Dan zijn we op zoek naar jou!


In het kader van een 2-jarig wetenschappelijk onderzoeksproject is het consortium van Hogeschool Zuyd, Hogeschool Rotterdam en het Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis opzoek naar een docent-onderzoeker (0,6 FTE).

*Achtergronden*


Het succesvol integreren van eHealth-innovaties, is van vitaal belang voor het verbeteren van de zorgkwaliteit en toegankelijkheid. Thuismeten is een van de innovaties die kan bijdragen aan een efficiëntere zorgverlening en een betere toegankelijkheid. Onderzoek toont aan dat digitaal thuis meten aanzienlijke voordelen biedt, waaronder een betere patiëntervaring, meer regie over het zorgproces, verbeterde veiligheid en kostenbesparingen. Juveniele dermatomyositis (JDM), een zeldzame ziekte bij kinderen, zou aanzienlijke voordelen kunnen halen uit thuismeten. Momenteel zijn monitoringtools zoals de Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) alleen beschikbaar in gespecialiseerde medische centra, wat frequente monitoring moeilijk maakt. Een veelbelovende ontwikkeling is het gebruik van AI-gebaseerde oplossingen voor real-time analyse van videobeelden. Deze ontwikkeling roept echter nog vragen op over acceptatie en betrouwbaarheid en inzetbaarheid. Daarom heeft Zuyd Hogeschool (Lectoraat Dataintelligence) samen met de kennis en praktijk partners Kinderfysiotherapie (Hogeschool Rotterdam), het Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis en eerstelijnskinderfysiotherapeuten tot de volgende vraagstelling gekomen: Hoe kunnen we de implementatie van betrouwbare AI-gebaseerde thuismetingsoplossingen bevorderen om meer frequente en consistente ziekte monitoring mogelijk te maken, de fysiotherapeutische behandeling te optimaliseren en daarmee de kwaliteit van zorg voor kinderen met JDM te verbeteren?


### **Wat ga je doen?**



Dit project wordt uitgevoerd op de kruising tussen zorg, innovatie en technologie waarbij de beantwoording van de vraag een duidelijke co-creatieaanpak vereist, nauwe betrokkenheid van zorgprofessionals en richtlijnen om de kansen en uitdagingen van thuismeten met behulp van AI in de praktijk te adresseren. Als onderzoeker in dit project ben jij de verbindende factor die bijdraagt aan het ontwikkelen van de applicatie (in samenwerking met professionals in de data-technologie), handelingskaders ontwikkeld voor de toepassing van de ontwikkelde AI applicatie (in samenwerking met kinderfysiotherapeuten) en het valideren en testen van het algoritme in de praktijk. Uiteindelijk moet dit project niet alleen leiden tot een applicatie voor de beroepspraktijk, maar ook leiden tot kaders voor het verantwoord en gewetensvol handelen met AI in de zorg. Het project betreft een periode van twee jaar en een promotie behoort tot de mogelijkheden.


### **Ben jij wie we zoeken?**



De geschikte kandidaat is een afgestudeerde kinderfysiotherapeut (of in de afrondende fase) met een affiniteit met data-technologie. Ervaring met klinische bewegingsanalyse aangevuld met basiskennis in programmeren (Python, R, Matlab) is een pre. De bereidheid om deze vaardigheden verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en implementatie is voorwaardelijk. Het verzorgen van scholing en onderwijs in het kader van het project kunnen tot de taken behoren. De geschikte kandidaat beschouwt zich als een teamspeler met uitstekende organisatie vaardigheden die energie krijgt van het samenwerken met diverse stakeholders uit verschillende domeinen.


### **Wat bieden we jou?**


* Contract voor bepaalde tijd (D4) voor de duur van het project (2 jaar);
* Afhankelijk van ervaring tussen de € 3.370 en maximaal € 5.019,73 bruto per maand (schaal 10 CAO HBO) bij een fulltime dienstverband;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 8,3% eindejaarsuitkering;
* Onze secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden omvatten uitstekende scholingsmogelijkheden;
* Een aantrekkelijke pensioenregeling via ABP;
* Bij interne kandidaten worden nadere afspraken gemaakt over de arbeidsvoorwaarden, bijvoorbeeld over de mogelijkheden van detachering;
* De verdeling van de uren (aantal fte noemen bij parttime) is in nader overleg af te stemmen;
* Onze wens is te starten per 9 september.

Als Business Analist kom je te werken bij Bureau Risicobeoordeling & onderzoek (BuRO), maar werk je voor de gehele directie Strategie. Daarbij werk je intensief samen met collega’s binnen en buiten de directie, zoals business informatie managers, business analisten, business- en data architecten. Samen ben je verantwoordelijk voor de regie en doorontwikkeling van de informatievoorziening binnen de directie Strategie.

Met jouw pioniersgeest pas je daar perfect bij en ga je bijvoorbeeld actief op zoek naar waardevolle vraagstukken. Je bent in staat om collega’s die meer afstand hebben tot het IV-gebied mee te nemen, te enthousiasmeren en te overtuigen.

We vinden het in Nederland heel normaal dat de producten die we gebruiken en alles wat wij eten veilig is. Dat dieren goed worden behandeld, ook als ze voor de slacht bestemd zijn. Groente en fruit willen we gedachteloos kunnen consumeren en ook andere producten zijn ‘natuurlijk’ in orde. We willen onbekommerd in de natuur kunnen wandelen en speelgoed voor onze kinderen kopen zonder achterdocht. Als consumenten vertrouwen we daar gewoon op, voor ons is dat vanzelfsprekend.  

  

Maar we vergeten soms dat bedrijven dagelijks hard werken aan die hoge standaard. Dat het voor ondernemers niet altijd makkelijk is om aan alle geldende wet- en regelgeving te voldoen. We vergeten ook dat de overheid daarop toeziet. Veiligheid klinkt zo eenvoudig, maar dat is het niet.  

  

Wat doet de NVWA?  

De medewerkers van de Nederlandse Voedsel- en Warenautoriteit (NVWA) werken dagelijks hard om die standaard te behouden. In gesprek met ondernemers in de horeca, de slachterijen, de plantenteelt en met andere producenten ziet de NVWA toe op de voedsel- en productveiligheid, plantgezondheid en het welzijn van dieren, natuur en milieu. Met (inter)nationale wet- en regelgeving in de hand. We gaan uit van vertrouwen, maar tegen ondernemers die het niet zo nauw nemen, treden we stevig op. In het belang van de samenleving.  

  

Wij kijken scherp waar de grootste risico’s zitten en waar toezicht het hardst nodig is, zodat we consumenten en anderen tijdig kunnen informeren. Ook heeft de NVWA een belangrijke rol bij exportkeuringen en bij de import van producten in Europa.  

  

Waar staat de NVWA voor?  

De NVWA is verantwoordelijk voor het toezicht op dierenwelzijn, diergezondheid, voedselveiligheid, productveiligheid, tabaks- en alcoholontmoediging, plantgezondheid en natuur en milieu.  

  

De Rijksoverheid streeft ernaar een werkgever te zijn waar iedere medewerker, ongeacht leeftijd, sekse, geaardheid, etnische afkomst en arbeidsbeperking voor wil werken. Werken aan maatschappelijke vraagstukken in divers samengestelde teams maakt ons effectiever en innovatiever. Dat maakt het werk waardevol en uitdagend.  

  

De NVWA is een Agentschap van het ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit en het ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport.

Inhoudelijk stuur je collega’s aan die je ondersteunen bij onderzoeksprojecten en bovenal ben je een echte teamspeler die ook het vermogen heeft om zelfstandig te werken.
Het team  

Het Business Insights team houdt zich dagelijks bezig met uiteenlopende projecten die betrekking hebben op data, onderzoek en de visualisatie hiervan. Denk aan communicatie-effect onderzoek, doelgroeponderzoek, consumer journeys en budgetsetting. De resultaten gebruik we om data gedreven advies te geven aan zowel collega’s intern als onze adverteerders.

Samen met de strategen uit het Business Strategy team kom je tot inzichten over merk, markt, communicatie, media en consument. Je bent dagelijks bezig met het combineren en interpreteren van data uit diverse bronnen (o.a. mediadata, klantdata en onderzoeksdata). Je ontwikkelt onderzoeksvoorstellen, zet vragenlijsten op en maakt analyses. De resultaten verwerk je in rapportages, presentaties en online dashboards. Tot slot lever je een belangrijke bijdrage aan het ontwikkelen en delen van kennis binnen Mindshare.

Jouw taken en verantwoordelijkheden:
* Samen met collega’s (Business Strategy en Communication & Media) de informatiebehoeften van de klant in kaart brengen;
* Ontwerpen, verkopen, rapporteren en presenteren van onderzoekstrajecten;
* Analyseren en interpreteren van data uit diverse bronnen;
* Doorvertalen van onderzoeksresultaten naar concreet oplossingsgericht advies;
* Verstevigen van de relatie met onze klanten waardoor ze jou als ‘trusted advisor’ zien;
* Commerciële verantwoordelijkheid nemen (sturen op inkomensgroei en rentabiliteit);
* Bijdrage leveren aan visieontwikkeling en kennisdeling binnen Mindshare.

Wij bieden:
* Een plek waar je de ruimte en begeleiding krijgt om jezelf te ontwikkelen;
* Een goede werksfeer waarin iedereen zichzelf kan zijn en waar het teamgevoel sterk is;
* Een concurrerend salaris;
* Laptop van de zaak & telefoonvergoeding;
* Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden & ontwikkelmogelijkheden inclusief trainingen;
* Groot internationaal netwerk (Mindshare, GroupM, WPP);
* Prachtig kantoor in de Rivierenbuurt met fantastische lunchmogelijkheden én uitzicht over Amsterdam;
* Startdatum per 1 november 2024.

Wij vragen:
* 8+ jaar relevante (marketing/media) werkervaring met kennis van de Nederlandse markt;
* Kennis van de planningspraktijk van off- en online media is een pré;
* Ruime ervaring met communicatie-effectonderzoek en het adviseren van marketeers op basis van onderzoeksdata;
* WO/HBO+ achtergrond, opleiding marketing/communicatie, psychologie, sociale wetenschappen;
* Vaardig met IBM SPSS Statistics, minimaal crosstabs;
* Uitstekende Microsoft Office vaardigheden, met name Excel en PowerPoint;
* Je bent analytisch en nauwkeurig;
* Proactief en initiatiefrijk;
* Communicatief en verbaal sterk, zowel in het Nederlands als in het Engels;
* Goede presentatievaardigheden en dit doe je met plezier;
* Een consultatieve mindset is essentieel voor deze rol.

The sub-team focusing on ESG Data has been active for almost a year. As a member of this team, the goal is to collaboratively build an ESG Data platform with IT Developers to supply the team involved in Sustainable Finance Regulation Modelling with the necessary data to monitor ESG risk.  

  

Given the significance that regulatory authorities attribute to modelling and the underlying data, this role is challenging and impactful. The Sustainable Finance Regulation project is a new and excellent opportunity to become familiar with this development. Tasks related to this project, which involve building the platform, include:  

  

* Inventory of the playing field with all stakeholders and parties involved;
* Collection of all data requirements for the models;
* Gap analysis of the data requirements for the SFR regulation and the data already available on the platform;
* Planning of the delivery of the required data;
* Actual delivery of dataset to the consumers.


  

Once the platform is ready, you will be involved in the data collection process. Your duties will encompass technical aspects such as SQL and Python programming, performing Data Quality analyses, and integrating datasets. Simultaneously, you'll be working on documentation and utilizing your communicative skills for stakeholder alignment. Active participation in frequent team meetings, where knowledge-sharing and progress transparency are key, is also expected. In this role, everything revolves around data modelling, along with related activities:  

  

* Discussing data requirements for different ESG risk models and reports with the modellers and reporting analysts;
* Make an inventory of the relevant databases within the bank and gain access to them;
* Combine tables (merge / link) and aggregate data in SQL and Python;
* Apply Data Quality Analysis, for example, course over time, missing values, extreme values;
* Investigate the plausibility of the new data;
* Document the data sourcing process and descriptive statistics and discuss this with the business parties;
* Additionally, there are many ad hoc activities, and you will regularly participate in cross-departmental projects. Your ability and willingness to collaborate are crucial for success in this role. You naturally take initiative, organize work effectively, and eagerly work with others to deliver tangible results. You possess a practical, analytical approach and strong communication and presentation skills. Being a robust team player, you take responsibility for your work. In the dynamic environment in which you operate, you have the ability to get all stakeholders on board.


  

Some of the 'tools of the trade' you will use in this position include SQL, SAS, Python, Azure platform, and Databricks.**Werkomgeving**

Je staat er niet alleen voor want je bent onderdeel van een gedreven groep collega’s in een scrumteam. Dat team is verantwoordelijk voor het analyseren en interpreteren van data om strategische beslissingen te ondersteunen en bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren.

Je kunt meerdere rollen tegelijk op je nemen en meerdere collega’s kunnen dezelfde rol vervullen.

**Wat bieden wij?**

Door jouw onderzoek en adviezen geef je invulling aan de risk awareness van ANWB Energie en draag je bij aan de ambitie om verdere volwassenheidsgroei te realiseren op het gebied van risicomanagement. Deze baan biedt jou een unieke kans om voort de borduren op al bestaande methodieken en verder uit te werken in kwantitatieve modellen.

### **Jouw rol**

**Huidige situatie en ambitieniveau**


Als Risicomanager Energie ligt jouw focus op het nieuwe bedrijfsonderdeel ANWB Energie B.V., een zelfstandige (juridische) entiteit met een eigen directie. Momenteel heeft ANWB Energie B.V. ruim 120.000+ klanten en een jaaromzet van ongeveer 200 mln. Euro. ANWB Energie B.V. zal de komende jaren sterk doorgroeien en heeft de ambitie om 500.000 klanten te bedienen. Daarmee zal de omzet groeien naar > 1 miljard Euro en dat maakt dat de omzet van ANWB Energie B.V. een significant deel zal uitmaken van de totale omzet van de ANWB-groep als geheel.


Als zelfstandig opererend en sterk groeiend bedrijfsonderdeel zal ANWB Energie B.V. alle commerciële, operationele, IT en regulatory compliance activiteiten zelf gaan vormgeven om de hierboven genoemde ambitie te behalen en om compliant te zijn met de veranderende wet- en regelgeving.

In de stappen die ANWB Energie B.V. maakt is besloten om de inkoop- en portfolio managementfunctie ook zelf in te gaan vullen en uit te gaan voeren. Daartoe zijn een senior portfolio manager en een senior portfolio analist inmiddels al aangenomen. Bij het zelf invullen en uitvoeren van de inkoop- en portfolio managementfunctie is het cruciaal dat de risicomanagement functie ook wordt verstevigd.

**Inhoud van de rol**


Als Risicomanager Energie voeg je waarde toe, omdat je in een tweedelijns-rol signaleert, adviseert, ondersteunt en monitort op de doelstellingen en risico’s van de ANWB en van ANWB Energie B.V. in het bijzonder.

* Een ondersteunende rol spelen in de ontwikkeling en implementatie van nieuwe initiatieven aan de inkoop- en portfolio managementzijde bij ANWB Energie. Dit doe je door mee te denken met de business
* Een actieve rol spelen in de ontwikkeling en implementatie van nieuwe initiatieven in de verdere ontwikkeling van de centrale tweede lijn, waarbij de ambitie is de komende jaren **verdere volwassenheidsgroei te realiseren** op het gebied van risicomanagement
* Je kunt gevraagd worden adviezen voor te bereiden bij strategische besluiten, die het risicoprofiel van ANWB Energie beïnvloeden
* Monitoren van de opvolging van risicobeperkende maatregelen en een rol spelen in het voorbereiden en uitdragen van beleid op het eigen vakgebied

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=0c48e3966dd23e85,indeed,Site Reliability Engineer (DevOps),Vattenfall,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Vattenfall,"Amsterdam, NH, NL",fulltime,2024-07-23,,,,,False,,,ewa.krajewska@vattenfall.com,"**Over de functie**
-------------------

 **Do you want to commit to a critical challenge and help to shape our future?**


We keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages, and configuration errors.


We are looking for a team member who is driven by technical challenges and the urge to always find better and more efficient ways of delivering services to the customer.  

  

**What will you do?**


In the role as SRE engineer you will combine the skillset of dev teams and operations teams by applying a software engineering approach to IT operations.


To succeed in this role it is important that you are self-driven, exact, analytic, critical and know how to prioritize. You are not only an expert in your field but you also have social competence and understand the business needs. You always challenge yourself and others to improve. You are also open for suggestions from others and can also give your own.


You are a team player and have a hands-on mindset, a strong customer- and problem-solving orientation. You show fast results, and you have demonstrated good communication skills, especially in an international organization. You need to be able to work independently in an international team that meets more virtually than physically.

  

  

**Your tasks and responsibilities:**

**Maintaining Applications to Help Operations and Support Teams**


As a SRE you are in charge of proactively implementing and maintaining infrastructure and business applications. This can be anything from provisioning servers, updating systems, deploying new software, providing pre-emptive maintenance to monitoring and alerting to code changes in production. A site reliability engineer can be tasked with building a homegrown tool from scratch to help with weaknesses in software delivery or incident management.


You must always be looking to improve quality and efficiency and cut costs.

**Fixing Support Escalation Issues**


Similarly to the point above, a site reliability engineer can be expected to spend time fixing support escalation cases.

**Optimizing On-Call Rotations and Processes**


More times than not, site reliability engineers will need to take on-call responsibilities and improve system reliability through the optimization of on-call processes. You will help add automation and context to alerts – leading to better real-time collaborative response from on-call responders. Additionally, you will update runbooks, tools and documentation to help prepare your on-call team members for future incidents.

**Documenting “Tribal” K****nowledge**


As you gain exposure to systems in both staging and production, as well as all technical teams, you will take part in work with software development, support, IT operations and on-call duties – meaning you will build up a great amount of historical knowledge over time. Instead of keeping this knowledge in the mind of one team or one person, as SRE you are expected to document much of what you know. Constant upkeep of documentation and runbooks can ensure teams get the information they need right when they need it.

**Conducting Post-Incident Reviews**


Without thorough post-incident reviews, you have no way to identify what’s working and what’s not. As such you will be participating in post-incident reviews, documenting your findings and taking action on your learnings.


Maybe also add \""provision new servers\""... it is attractive to have a more technical approach to woo away developers and coordinators!

 **Location**  

  

Katowice, Gliwice, Amsterdam or Solna

**Jouw profiel**
----------------

 **Who are you?**  

  

As our Site Reliability Engineer you:

* Are an expert in your field, strong technical and analytical skills, can solve impossible problems.
* Have the ability to translate complicated technical matters into simple understandable language.
* Have experience in building and operating of server virtualization environments.
* Have thorough knowledge of operating systems (Linux/Windows 2019 and up).
* Work with Agile methodology.
* Have experience in troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
* Are able to deal with tight deadlines when they arise.
* Have automation experience with at least one configuration/deployment management system (Ansible, Jenkins pipelines, Azure DevOps…).
* Have experience with at least one of the following scripting languages (Powershell, Shell, Python…).
* Have experience working with GIT.
* Have experience developing CI/CD.

  

Next to this you bring:

* Experience in a large international environment is desirable.
* Experience with containers is a plus.

To maintain a safe, economically viable, and biodiverse environment, fundamental changes are needed in our land use, soil management, and water management. In this context, transitioning towards Nature-Based adaptation becomes increasingly important.


**Your job**
------------


As part of the Nationaal Groeifonds programme NL2120, the Department of Physical Geography at Utrecht University explores adaptation approaches for Dutch rivers and peatlands. We are seeking two PhD candidates who are eager to contribute to this climate adaptation challenge through two separate projects.


**Sustainable RiverScapes (Position 1)** aims to develop integrated nature-based strategies for the Dutch river areas to adapt to the changing climate and enhance biodiversity. The challenge is to find adaptation solutions that optimize flood safety, sedimentation, biodiversity, and balance cost and benefits. You will extend and apply the RiverScape model, which simulates the hydro-morphological effects of nature-based interventions in the river-floodplain area. Using field observations with state-of-the-art instruments enabled by the new Delta-ENIGMA facility, you will quantitatively analyze floodplain vegetation and sediment dynamics to develop new vegetation and sediment modules in RiverScape. Subsequently, you will evaluate different strategies under a range of future scenarios to assess how nature-based approaches can contribute to the climate adaptation of river landscapes.


**Sustainable Peatlands (Position 2)** aims to develop strategies for the sustainable development and climate-resilient use of peatland areas to enhance carbon sequestration and biodiversity, and to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. To date, it is unknown how drained peatlands can be optimally used as nature-based solutions from a greenhouse gas perspective, and what water and soil management measures are required. Fundamental understanding of the natural dynamics of peatland systems is still needed. For this research, a unique peatland growth pilot is being developed in the province of Friesland. Field measurements at the pilot site and in other peatlands, laboratory measurements, and numerical models will be used to investigate peat growth, carbon storage, and greenhouse gas emissions under changing conditions such as groundwater levels. In this project, you will quantify and monitor carbon sequestration under different conditions in peatland areas across the Netherlands, identify the role of the water system and other controls on carbon sequestration, and develop strategies to make polders climate-neutral.


Within the NL2120 project, both PhDs will integrate their results with studies on governance and economics conducted at other universities and by external parties (Deltares, WUR, NGOs, water boards, and Rijkswaterstaat).


To support academic and personal development, PhD candidates will follow courses and assist in teaching Earth Sciences at the Bachelor’s and Master’s levels. Together, these activities amount to twenty percent of the contracted time.


**Your qualities**
------------------


This project may be right for you if you have:


* an MSc in Earth sciences, physical geography, hydrology, environmental science, civil engineering (position 1), or ecology (position 2);
* experience with geoscientific field observations and data retrieval using field equipment;
* proven skills in programming, numerical modelling, and using spatial datasets (Python / willing to learn Python), as well as scenario analysis;
* an interest in interdisciplinary scientific challenges and interactions;
* ability to work independently, take initiative, and demonstrate a critical mindset;
* strong organizational and communication skills, with a collaborative team spirit;
* excellent English oral and written skills, and a willingness to learn Dutch.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for 1 year, with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period;
* a working week of 36 hours and a gross monthly salary between €2.770 and €3.539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth.

In this role you can develop yourself in a professional as well as a personal way.

**Je werk**
-----------


The sub-team focusing on ESG Data has been active for almost a year. As a member of this team, the goal is to collaboratively build an ESG Data platform with IT Developers to supply the team involved in Sustainable Finance Regulation Modelling with the necessary data to monitor ESG risk.  

  

Given the significance that regulatory authorities attribute to modelling and the underlying data, this role is challenging and impactful. The Sustainable Finance Regulation project is a new and excellent opportunity to become familiar with this development. Tasks related to this project, which involve building the platform, include:  

  

* Inventory of the playing field with all stakeholders and parties involved;
* Collection of all data requirements for the models;
* Gap analysis of the data requirements for the SFR regulation and the data already available on the platform;
* Planning of the delivery of the required data;
* Actual delivery of dataset to the consumers.


  

Once the platform is ready, you will be involved in the data collection process. Your duties will encompass technical aspects such as SQL and Python programming, performing Data Quality analyses, and integrating datasets. Simultaneously, you'll be working on documentation and utilizing your communicative skills for stakeholder alignment. Active participation in frequent team meetings, where knowledge-sharing and progress transparency are key, is also expected. In this role, everything revolves around data modelling, along with related activities:  

  

* Discussing data requirements for different ESG risk models and reports with the modellers and reporting analysts;
* Make an inventory of the relevant databases within the bank and gain access to them;
* Combine tables (merge / link) and aggregate data in SQL and Python;
* Apply Data Quality Analysis, for example, course over time, missing values, extreme values;
* Investigate the plausibility of the new data;
* Document the data sourcing process and descriptive statistics and discuss this with the business parties;
* Additionally, there are many ad hoc activities, and you will regularly participate in cross-departmental projects. Your ability and willingness to collaborate are crucial for success in this role. You naturally take initiative, organize work effectively, and eagerly work with others to deliver tangible results. You possess a practical, analytical approach and strong communication and presentation skills. Being a robust team player, you take responsibility for your work. In the dynamic environment in which you operate, you have the ability to get all stakeholders on board.

----------------------


De afdeling CBRN Protection staat in de frontlinie van bescherming tegen schadelijke of levensbedreigende chemische en biologische agentia. Ons team voert baanbrekend onderzoek uit om de detectie, identificatie, diagnose en decontaminatie van deze agentia te versnellen en te verbeteren. Daarnaast werken we aan innovatieve oplossingen voor medische behandeling na blootstelling aan chemische agentia. Onze geavanceerde kennis en faciliteiten worden internationaal op hoog niveau gewaardeerd.  

  

Wij streven naar praktische toepassingen van ons onderzoek en werken daarvoor nauw samen met een breed scala aan klanten en partners, waaronder nationale en internationale overheden, gelieerde onderzoeksinstituten en de industrie. Onze voornaamste stakeholder is het Ministerie van Defensie. Met ons onderzoek beschermen we militairen, civiele hulpverleners en burgers die, bijvoorbeeld bij de uitoefening van hun beroep, risico lopen op blootstelling aan chemische of biologische strijdmiddelen, zowel in binnen- als buitenland. Bij CBRN Protection zijn we trots op onze bijdrage aan een veiligere wereld, kom jij ons team versterken? Ter versterking van ons team zijn wij namelijk op zoek naar een getalenteerde en gemotiveerde (experimenteel) fysicus of (chemisch) procestechnoloog. Je werkt onder andere aan de analyse en modellering van CBRN-dreigingen en daaraan verwante risico’s. Daarnaast ontwikkel en verbeter je experimentele opstellingen waarbij je jouw kennis en creativiteit volop kunt inzetten. Lees hier meer over de afdeling CBRN Protection!
**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Als scientist op het gebied van CBRN-bescherming en dreigingsanalyse zal je toegepast wetenschappelijk onderzoek uitvoeren binnen onze projecten. Je werkt regelmatig samen met (aerosol) onderzoekers voor het ontwerpen en ontwikkelen van hoogtechnische opstellingen, om gecontroleerd (toxische) agentia te aerosolizeren en te bestuderen. De verkregen data uit deze opstellingen worden onder andere gebruikt als input van de modelstudies. Je vindt het leuk om zelf te sleutelen aan deze opstellingen en hier metingen mee te doen en deze zodanig te verbeteren dat de juiste experimenten kunnen worden gedaan. Op termijn zul je de bestaande experimentele opstellingen doorontwikkelen, verbeteren én meehelpen aan het ontwerpen van nieuwe opstellingen.  

Je zult je ook bezig houden met het modelleren van dispersie en dreiging van CBRN-agentia. Op basis van (experimenteel) onderzoek, literatuuronderzoek en (dispersie) modellering schat je de dreiging die van CBRN-agentia uitgaat in. Dit modelleerwerk doe je o.a. aan de hand van ventilatie modellen, dispersie studies en Computional Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modellen. Jouw uitkomsten hiervan worden gebruikt om de risico’s, vóór en na het toepassen van bestaande en nieuwe tegenmaatregelen, voor militairen, eerste-hulpverleners en burgers te evalueren.  

  

Je wordt onderdeel van ons gezellige en diverse CBRN Protection team waarin organisch-chemici, microbiologen, moleculair biologen, analytisch-chemici, farmacologen, toxicologen en aerosolfysici nauw met elkaar samenwerken. We beschikken over hoogwaardige faciliteiten zoals een HoogTOX laboratorium, een laboratorium voor organische synthese, faciliteiten voor dierproeven, biological safety level 2 en 3 laboratoria, een (bio)aerosol testkamer en een state-of-the-art massaspectrometrie laboratorium. Bij ons krijg je de kans om in een stimulerende omgeving te werken en samen met experts uit verschillende disciplines bij te dragen aan innovatieve oplossingen voor een veiligere wereld. We kijken er naar uit om jou in ons team te verwelkomen!
**Wat wij van jou verwachten**
------------------------------


Je bent oplossingsgericht, analytisch, hebt grote affiniteit voor modelleren en data-analyse en krijgt energie van het construeren en verbeteren van experimentele opstellingen. Daarnaast ben je klantgericht en in staat om een klantvraag te vertalen naar onderzoek en innovatieve ideeën. Je werkt graag in een team, kunt goed communiceren met je collega’s (in zowel Nederlands als Engels) en je vindt het leuk om collega’s te verbinden en te inspireren. Daarnaast ben je een probleemoplosser met een hands-on mentaliteit en werk je nauwkeurig en gestructureerd, met aandacht voor kwaliteit.  

  

Wat je verder meebrengt?
* Je hebt een afgeronde MSc opleiding in de (experimentele) fysica, fysische transportverschijnselen, (chemische)proceskunde, of een aanverwante opleiding;
* Enkele jaren relevante werkervaring is een pré maar we zijn ook geinteresseerd als je net bent afgestudeerd;
* Je hebt technische kennis en interesse voor o.a. het onderhouden van hoogwaardige analytische apparatuur, ontwikkelen van testopstellingen en (veld)monstername en vindt het leuk om te sleutelen aan apparatuur en opstellingen;

* Kennis van en ervaring met modelleren, data-analyse en dataverwerking;
* Kennis van CFD modellen is een pré, maar niet verplicht.

**About us**  


The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic and biotic factors, and the interplay between those. The IBED vision includes research encompassing experimental and theoretical approaches at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e. from molecules and microorganisms to patterns and processes occurring at the global scale. The University of Amsterdam has excellent high performance computing facilities. Furthermore, IBED has a dedicated computational support team with specialized knowledge of bioinformatics, (geo)database management and scientific programming. IBED also works with non-academic partners to deliver transdisciplinary science for society.  


The SISTEM-NL project investigates the release of synthetic microfibres (a form of microplastics) from textiles during everyday washing of clothing. Textiles are the 4th largest source of microplastics and better understanding the factors influencing microfibre release, as well as studying societal views on textiles as a source of microplastic pollution, is needed to design effective mitigation measures. In SISTEM-NL citizen scientists work together with an interdisciplinary team of scientists from the UvA’s Faculties of Science (FNWI) and of Social and Behavioural Sciences (FMG) to tackle this sustainability challenge.

---------------------


The COVID-19 pandemic showed that viral (mis)information about the outbreak can spread as easily as the virus itself. Such an ‘infodemic’ can influence people’s attitude and behavior regarding the prevention and transmission of infectious diseases. To prepare for the next pandemic, this study aims to increase our understanding of the relationship between infodemic (information) and pandemic (infection) dynamics. **The TRENDING project** studies the interplay between information exposure and infectious disease transmission. The aim is to develop a mathematical model combining this interplay using real-life data. This model will estimate the impact of different infodemic interventions on the number of new infections.


**About the role**
------------------


As a postdoctoral researcher, you will be involved in designing and developing a mathematical model taking into account infectious disease and (mis)information transmission. Your main responsibilities are:


* To develop a deterministic compartment model that describes transmission of a respiratory infection and the interplay with (mis)information;
* To calibrate the model to real-life contact and information seeking data (these data will be collected within the TRENDING project, through a survey conducted by a junior researcher);
* To analyse the impact of various infodemic management interventions;
* To publish your research findings in peer-reviewed scientific journals;
* To collaborate in a multidisciplinary team consisting of modelers, epidemiologists, infodemic specialists, behavioral scientists and computational social scientists.

***Interested in working on autonomous robots for the real, open world in a multidisciplinary team and also doing a PhD? Join us!***


Job description


You will work within the OpenBots laboratory creating autonomous robots that operate in the real world with various other PhDs and engineers. The OpenBots laboratory aims to develop a common sense capability for robots making them able to understand their surroundings and plan proper actions to execute their inspection task, even when part of their surrounding world is unknown and dynamic. The inspection task deals with a robot walking around a perimeter and, meanwhile, detecting abnormal events based on vision or sound, after which a detailed investigation of the siutation might be required. The common sense capabililty that we develop shall allow the robot to complete similar inspection tasks in different (potentially changing) environments, such as governmental buildings, industrial plants, or train tracks. Our developments shall follow the latest achievements in artificial intelligence, world modelling, knowledge representations, mission planning and motion planning, where each team member has its own specialization.



Your research will be related to task and motion planning, assuming that the robot has an awareness about the situation it is currently in and about the situation that is desired. Therein, you will study and develop algorithms for planning the execution of the robot's inspection task. Planning is constrained by the policies that are enforced by a user, while execution is constrained by the physical characteristics of the environment, or terrain, and by the limitations of the robot's locomotion capabilities. Therefore, your research is expected to start from a graph representation describing the situation and the planning problem that needs to be solved, like a Markov decision process, after which some combination of logic reasoning, discrete optimization and machine learning results in a seemless execution in which the robot stays withing the bounderies set by the policy. Task execution may be aborted or adjusted in the case that obstacles need to be avoided, or new invesigation tasks emerge. Also, given the complexity and uncertainties of (unknown) events in the real world, your task and motion planning capability should exploit the experience of prior executions and learn how they may apply to in the current situation.



The OpenBots project is being carried out in a team of 5 PhD students, 3 at the Delft University of Technology (where this vacancy is one of such PhDs) and 2 at the University of Amsterdam. You will work 3 days a week at the university and the other 2 days you will work with all other 5 PhDs at one of the external partners being TNO and the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee where a physical lab environment is available. The project is carried out with supervisors from the Cognitive Robotics Group of the Delft University of Technology (Prof. J. Alonso-Mora , Dr. J. Sijs and Dr. C. Hernandez Corbato) and the Video and Image Sense Lab of the University of Amsterdam (Prof. Cees Snoek).


Requirements


Need to haves:


* Graduated in one of these fields: System and Controls, Artificial Intelligence, Mechanical/Electrical Engineering, Robotics, or Applied Mathematics (or related).
* Interest in robotics, artificial intelligence and data science.
* Demonstrable experience in symbolic planning, reinforcement learning, motion planning and/or Markov decision processes.
* Solid mathematics foundations, especially statistics, calculus and linear algebra;
* Team player and willing to work in a multidisciplinary team of engineers, technicians and scientists.
* Programming skills using languages such as Python/C++, as well as robotic tools, such as ROS and Gazebo.
* You are highly motivated, independent, and creative.
* Strong communication, presentation and writing skills and proficient command of English.


Nice to haves:


* Experience with publishing scientific work.
* Experience with embedded software and hardware.


Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis.

Conditions of employment


Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts.

You will work within the OpenBots laboratory creating autonomous robots that operate in the real world with various other PhDs and engineers.

Our developments shall follow the latest achievements in artificial intelligence, world modelling, knowledge representations, mission planning and motion planning, where each team member has its own specialization.



Your research will be related to world modelling and knowledge representation, i.e., creating the robot's situational awareness, assuming that it is able to detect and observe individual objects and events through its camera and microphone. More specifically, you will study and develop algorithms for managing the robot's information based on these observations and based on a predefined, or learned, knowledge structure. Since our robots will operate in the real, open world, incoming information will be corrupted by noise and mistakes. Therefore, it is important that information is managed by combining evidences related to the observations with logic and symbolic reasoning, like a Bayesian network or Markov logic networks. However, to cope with the unknowns it might be essential to replace Bayes' principles with, for example, possiblity theory. In addition, we expect to develop deductive reasoning so that when the robot encounters an unknown situation it may rely on general knowledge/models, and plan experiments to either accept or falsify the application of such knowledge/models to the unknown situation. Finally, you will also study and develop algorithms that extract a situational graph representing the current situation of the robot, or its near-future. Situational graphs shall be used for task planning of the robot and should thus contain which task can be carried our where, for example through inductive reasoning on the available information along with patterns in such information that may be linked to a task-capability of the robot.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for:

**Postdoc on Logic, Structures and Homotopy in Optimisation**


The Theory cluster at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) is seeking candidates for a postdoc (1.0 FTE) position, working on category theoretical abstractions of optimisation theory and algorithms, and on higher categories for homotopy optimisation.  

Optimisation is central to modern computing, but conventional representations with explicit indices and the focus on individual tensors, functions, etc. hinders the understanding fundamental aspects of optimisation processes. The aim of this project is to develop abstract and compositional reasoning techniques for properties of optimisation processes using category theory, and to advance the homotopy optimisation method using higher category theory. Homotopy optimisation can be used to find more efficient optimisation algorithms, to couple optimisation with experimental and other parameters to avoid convergence to local minima or learning of paths between optima. This is an exciting direction in optimisation, which crucially needs structural techniques to further its development. We aim to begin the project in October 2024.

**Your Profile**  

If you find this project interesting, then please consider applying if you think that you fit the following. Ideally, you either have a strong background in optimisation algorithms and their mathematical underpinnings in terms of vector spaces, manifolds, etc., and would be willing to learn about structural methods from category theory, homotopy theory and higher category theory. Alternatively, you have a strong background in (higher) category theory and homotopy theory, combined with some understanding of algorithms and the willingness to dive into the subleties of optimisation algorithms. Your profile should be witnessed by an appropriate academic track record.


Moreover, you

* hold a PhD degree in a relevant area (Computer Science or Mathematics);
* have a strong publication record;
* are able to collaborate with scientific peers inside and outside your own research area;
* like challenging research that may break new grounds by bringing together previously unconnected areas;
* have an academic, creative, and open mindset;
* have a good to excellent proficiency in English;
* either live and are officially registered as resident in The Netherlands, or are willing to relocate upon starting the position;
* can start working on the project in October 2024, although an earlier starting time is definitely possible and a later start may be agreed upon in consultation.

**Key responsibilities**  

Within this position it is expected that you will

* conduct research within the scope of the project and publish in relevant academic venues and journals;
* collaborate closely with both the Semantics, Types and Logic group of Henning Basold in the Theory cluster, and the Optimization and Learning group of Hao Wang in the Natural Computing cluster at LIACS;
* co-supervise BSc, MSc and PhD students;
* engage in activities of the group, cluster, and the institute.

**De functie**
--------------


In de functie van data scientist werk je voor de directie Financiën en Inkoop. Het leuke daarvan: dit gaat niet alleen om euro’s, maar ook om wat we daarmee precies doen. En dat is veel! Dankzij de producten uit jouw team hebben managers en hun adviseurs beter zicht op budget en uitgaven. De directie heeft beter zicht op de efficiency van werkprocessen. En het gemeentelijk directieteam kan beter sturen op geld en waarde.



Wat jouw rol precies inhoudt? Als data scientist ontwikkel en implementeer je data- en (generatieve) AI-oplossingen. Dat doe je samen met de collega’s binnen een datateam van data scientists, cloud engineers en BI specialisten, maar ook met collega’s die deze oplossingen gaan gebruiken. Je krijgt er dus direct een groot Amsterdams netwerk bij en werkt praktisch en creatief samen. Je bent daarnaast onderzoekend en vindt het leuk om te experimenteren met nieuwe technieken. Je reflecteert op je werk en je stimuleert collega’s om er samen alles uit te halen wat erin zit.


Dit doe je op een gemiddelde dag
--------------------------------

* Je werkt volgens een Agile Scrum methode en start daarom je dag met een standup. Je bespreekt met je collega’s in het scrum-team welke stories je gaat oppakken.
* Na een kop koffie ga je aan de slag, individueel dan wel samen, met het incrementeel produceren van een data- en AI-oplossing.
* Voordat je aan de lunch commit, test je jouw code en review je een pull-request van je collega.
* 's Middags staan er wat calls op het programma met je directe collega-ontwikkelaars of andere stakeholders om te zorgen dat iedereen op één lijn zit.
* Je houdt je ogen open voor de nieuwste trends die onze digitale overheid kunnen versterken en denkt na over hoe je die kunt toepassen binnen het financiële domein.
* Je eindigt je dag met het bijwerken van de Jira-omgeving en een gezamenlijk sportmoment als je op locatie werkt.


Hier ga je aan de slag
----------------------

We willen een goede werkgever zijn die ervoor zorgt dat alle collega’s zich gezien en gewaardeerd voelen. We koesteren verschillen tussen collega’s, al die verschillen zorgen voor betere resultaten voor onze organisatie én onze stad. We streven daarbij naar een personeelsbestand dat een afspiegeling is van de beroepsbevolking van Amsterdam. Dus wie jij ook bent: bij ons ben je van harte welkom!


Sluit je aan bij ons team Data, Rapportages & Innovatie, waar talentvolle nieuwkomers samen met ervaren experts Amsterdam vooruithelpen. We zijn een sociaal en divers team dat buiten werktijd graag samenkomt voor een drankje of een sportieve uitdaging. Maar laad jij liever op door op tijd naar huis te gaan? Ook helemaal prima. Bij ons draait het om samenwerken, plezier en de ruimte nemen om onze successen en het werk dat we doen te waarderen. Lijkt het jou wat om samen met ons inventieve oplossingen te bedenken die de gemeente helpen om verstandige financiële keuzes te maken? Dan is dit jouw plek.


Dit breng je mee
----------------

Voor de functie data scientist beschik je over:

* WO-denkniveau met een relevante opleiding in het vakgebied data science of AI.
* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring met het ontwikkelen en implementeren van data science en AI oplossingen in een complexe dataomgeving met behulp van Python en SQL.
* Hands-on ervaring met data science-tools in een cloud omgeving.
* Ervaring met het werken met DevOps en DataBricks in een Azure omgeving is een plus.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum methodiek en een versiebeheerplatform zoals Git.
* Bij voorkeur ervaring in het financiële domein of sterke affiniteit hiermee.


Aan competenties breng je mee:

* Inventiviteit. Je bedenkt verschillende, soms originele ideeën en oplossingen.
* Omgevingsbewustzijn. Je blijft goed op de hoogte van vakinhoudelijke, organisatorische, maatschappelijke, politieke ontwikkelingen of andere omgevingsfactoren en weet deze effectief te benutten.
* Sterke communicatieve vaardigheden om met diverse doelgroepen in gesprek te gaan (denk aan technici, dataspecialisten, financieel specialisten, managers en adviseurs).
* Resultaatgerichtheid. Je spant je in om concrete doelen te behalen en houdt vast totdat je het resultaat bereikt hebt.


Dit bieden we jou
-----------------

Als Data Scientist kom je ons maximaal 36 uur per week versterken en kun je rekenen op onderstaande arbeidsvoorwaarden.

* Een bruto maandsalaris van € 4.264,- tot € 6.072,- (schaal 11) op basis van een 36-urige werkweek. Het exacte salaris wordt afgestemd op de opleiding, kennis en ervaring die je meebrengt.
* Een arbeidsovereenkomst voor de duur van 1 jaar, met daarna de mogelijkheid op een overeenkomst voor onbepaalde tijd indien je op dit moment nog geen, of een tijdelijke, arbeidsovereenkomst hebt bij Gemeente Amsterdam.
* Ontwikkel- en opleidingsmogelijkheden. Ons interne opleidingscentrum, de Amsterdamse School, biedt verschillende opleidingen, ontwikkeltrajecten en begeleiding in het werk waardoor je jezelf kan blijven uitdagen.

Schuberg Philis continues to expand its focus on data for a growing number of customers which means that we are looking for Data Engineers.



We keep our customers moving forward by designing, building and running their data landscapes. These landscapes are often developed in public cloud environments, but there is diversity in implementation: not all customers are the same. We have data lake environments on our own hybrid cloud (sbp.cloud), AWS, Azure and more.


**As an AWS Data Engineer you will:**


* Develop and maintain data pipelines
* Configure and manage tools like Spark, Glue, Kinesis, S3, Lambda, Kafka, Redshift, Athena, EventHub, etc.
* Support tooling such as Gitlab (CI/CD), Terraform (Infra)
* Focus on the technical implementation of use cases and required tools on a new data platform
* Be involved in the data standards and initiatives that we have set for our customers


On a team level, you will be involved in the data strategy of the customer by developing a data platform that will be used to develop various use cases for the users of data. You get to actively explore, design, build and run data lakes in AWS. Your work will be completely customer-focused but you will also contribute to expanding and maturing the Schuberg Philis data landscape architecture and all of its initiatives.


**Who are we looking for?**



In this role, you will thrive if you have the following experience:


* Building data pipelines in a cloud-native manner (e.g. S3, Lambda's, Glue, etc )
* Used to working with large data sets in both data lakes (S3) & data warehouses (Redshift)
* Good AWS knowledge, especially all the data related services
* Python & data library ecosystem
* Spark + Spark Streaming (Java/Scala or PySpark)


Nice to have:


* Software development, particularly API's (Python)
* Kafka & Kafka Connect
* Terraform
* Docker
* Proficiency in Dutch
* AWS Data Analytics Certifications


If you are a strong team player who recognizes yourself in the above, likes to take ownership, can work independently as part of a team, and can challenge us on our decisions: we'd like to hear from you.

 *Everyone we work with and consider working with has a right to equal treatment. The hiring and appraisal process at Schuberg Philis is designed to be thorough and equitable, implementing fair payment, benefits, and opportunities across all demographics.*

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.

  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.  

  

Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?  

  

Naast een afgeronde Bachelor of Master en enkele jaren werkervaring zijn dit de specifieke skills die we zoeken:


* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met Python en PySpark.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met een Spark-omgeving als Azure Data Factory en/of Synapse.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met SQL DB en T-SQL.

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

At Returnista, our working culture is guided by four core values:

 ***We’re on this journey together:*** Working at a successful startup isn’t the same every day, as we constantly grow and innovate, we face new challenges. It’s important that we embrace this journey but also positively support each other. In practice, this can range from pair programming to travelling and celebrating together.

 ***We do it right:*** When you’re moving fast it can be tempting to constantly cut corners to things done. But this results in a product that is a struggle to work with and has unhappy users. We make that extra effort to be proud of what we’re building; understand the problem we’re solving, write one more test or tackle technical debt.

 ***We are empowered to act, challenge and lead:*** To work effectively as a team everyone must have a voice and feel they can stand up and be counted. As a software engineer at Returnista we want you to feel empowered. That could mean proposing new ideas, fixing things without seeking permission or challenging the CEO.

 ***We are intrepid:*** We want our engineers to show initiative and to innovate. Intrepid Friday’s give us the opportunity to work on things that might not ostensibly be the highest priority, but can make a big difference to our product or how we work.

**Company**

A.P. Moller-Maersk (Maersk) is a worldwide transport and logistics company with offices in around 130 countries and with global headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark. Maersk is listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Maersk employs roughly 95,000 people and generated total revenue of 51 billion USD in 2023. Maersk is currently undergoing a complex transformation from having been a relatively diversified conglomerate to becoming a focused transport and logistics company.


APM Terminals (APMT), a maritime terminal operator and core business unit of Maersk, operates one of the world’s most comprehensive port networks, which is uniquely positioned to help both shipping line- and landside customers grow their business and achieve better supply chain efficiency, flexibility and dependability to compete and win in world markets. The APMT team of 23,000 industry professionals across 42 countries and spanning five continents, is focused on providing customers with the most advanced terminal technology, equipment and operations in the industry across a network of +75 ports. In 2023, APM Terminals generated revenues 3.8 billion USD and carried out 40 million TEUs.


APMT is, like Maersk, undergoing an all-encompassing transformation from a multi-local, loosely coupled portfolio of individual terminals towards an integrated, best-in-class global terminal operator and stevedore. We casually refer to the journey as ‘ *from freestyle to franchise’* . The transformation involves developing and rolling out APMT’s *Way of Working* , built around a common operating system founded on Lean principles. It also entails a fundamental overhaul of our (digital) enterprise architecture to enable data-fueled business decisions, and cross-pollination of standard processes across our operations, including automation. Finally, the transformation aims to embed a culture of joint problem solving, (local) entrepreneurship and a collaborative mindset across our organization, including strong(er) linkages between our HQ- and frontline teams.

You will also work together closely with our data delivery teams to co-create what our data products need to look like, translated from business and technical requirements you help create. Lastly, together with the team, you will need to work together to contribute to the broader roadmap of data-driven value identification across the business, contributing to the project plans and initiatives to achieve this.


This position requires a mix of strong analytical & logical thinking, business acumen, problem solving, data analysis skills and project management, as well as stakeholder management, soft skills and the ability to frame up, execute, and drive resolution to complex issues. This is a dynamic, fast paced role that involves simultaneously seeing the bigger picture along with the small pieces that are critical to success.


**We are looking for**

* A passion for working with business stakeholders in identifying value and improvement initiatives
* A strong analytical mind that can navigate complexity in operations and business, can distil priority areas, and can simplify this into a problem statement and (data-driven) solution plan
* Someone that utilizes data-savviness to think through use-cases and ensure that data solutions align with business and operational needs
* Someone with strong data analysis and modelling skills that can easily extract key insights and is able to spot key patterns in information. Proficiency in data analysis tools & techniques (Excel & SQL, data-querying or similar, advanced techniques are a plus)
* Someone that can present and visualize these insights in a logical and comprehensible way that helps drive actionable insights and supports business decisions. Proficiency in presentation, visualization and insights tools & techniques (Powerpoint & PowerBI or similar)
* Flexibility with the ability to manage multiple topics and projects simultaneously and take ownership and responsibility of projects, with the tenacity to see them through
* A collaborative team player that is hands-on with a can-do attitude and proactive
* Strong interpersonal and communication skills (both verbal and written). Possess empathy, personal tact, and multi-cultural understanding
* Strong project management skills, with experience in creating and managing project plans
* Familiarity with agile way-of-working and defining technical and business requirements
* A minimum of 4+ years work experience in a similar capacity, experience in generating or working with data-driven insights, and working with business and operational processes definition and analysis
* Consulting experience is a plus
* Experience with the logistics, transportation, or mining industry is a plus – experience in working with large complex (blue chip) companies is a must
* English fluency written and spoken, and international work experience is beneficial
* Based in the Netherlands, but willingness to travel
* Master’s degree in e.g., Math, Physics, Engineering, Econometrics, Finance, Business Administration, or similar

*Research shows that while male candidates feel confident enough to apply when they meet about 60% of the requirements, female candidates only apply when they tick every box. So if this role has your name on it, but you’re not sure about the criteria, we still want to hear from you.*

The APMT team of 23,000 industry professionals across 42 countries and spanning five continents, is focused on providing customers with the most advanced terminal technology, equipment and operations in the industry across a network of +75 ports. In 2023, APM Terminals generated revenues 3.8 billion USD and carried out 40 million TEUs.


APMT is, like Maersk, undergoing an all-encompassing transformation from a multi-local, loosely coupled portfolio of individual terminals towards an integrated, best-in-class global terminal operator and stevedore. We casually refer to the journey as ‘ *from freestyle to franchise’* . The transformation involves developing and rolling out APMT’s *Way of Working* , built around a common operating system founded on Lean principles. It also entails a fundamental overhaul of our (digital) enterprise architecture to enable data-fueled business decisions, and cross-pollination of standard processes across our operations, including automation. Finally, the transformation aims to embed a culture of joint problem solving, (local) entrepreneurship and a collaborative mindset across our organization, including strong(er) linkages between our HQ- and frontline teams.

Your role is to be a partner to the business, in which you will collaborate with our leaders and (senior) business stakeholders to understand what drives value and assess indicators and data models for this. You will need to create an understanding of operational or business processes, develop models to represent this, and analyse data to create actionable insights.

You will contribute to the broader roadmap of data-driven value identification across the business, and manage the project plans and initiatives to achieve this. Lastly you will lead more junior Business Analysts to ensure delivery of the required project plans against set time and scope.


This position requires a mix of strong analytical & logical thinking, business acumen, problem solving, data analysis skills and project management, as well as stakeholder management, soft skills and the ability to frame up, execute, and drive resolution to complex issues. This is a dynamic, fast paced role that involves simultaneously seeing the bigger picture along with the small pieces that are critical to success.


**We are looking for**

* A passion for working with senior business stakeholders in identifying value and improvement initiatives
* A strong analytical mind that can navigate complexity in operations and business, can distil priority areas, and can simplify this into a problem statement and (data-driven) solution plan
* Someone that utilizes data-savviness to think through use-cases and ensure that data solutions align with business and operational needs
* Someone with strong data analysis and modelling skills that can easily extract key insights and is able to spot key patterns in information. Proficiency in data analysis tools & techniques (Excel & SQL, data-querying or similar, advanced techniques are a plus)
* Someone that can present and visualize these insights in a logical and comprehensible way that helps drive actionable insights and supports business decisions. Proficiency in presentation, visualization and insights tools & techniques (Powerpoint & PowerBI or similar)
* Flexibility with the ability to manage multiple topics and projects simultaneously and take ownership and responsibility of projects, with the tenacity to see them through
* A collaborative team player that is hands-on with a can-do attitude and proactive
* Strong interpersonal and communication skills (both verbal and written). Possess empathy, personal tact, and multi-cultural understanding
* Strong project management skills, with experience in creating and managing project plans
* Familiarity with agile way-of-working and defining technical and business requirements
* A minimum of 6+ years work experience in a similar capacity, experience in generating or working with data-driven insights, and working with business and operational processes definition and analysis
* Consulting experience is a plus
* Experience with the logistics, transportation, or mining industry is a plus – experience in working with large complex (blue chip) companies is a must
* English fluency written and spoken, and international work experience is beneficial
* Based in the Netherlands, but willingness to travel
* Master’s degree in e.g., Math, Physics, Engineering, Econometrics, Finance, Business Administration, or similar

*Research shows that while male candidates feel confident enough to apply when they meet about 60% of the requirements, female candidates only apply when they tick every box. So if this role has your name on it, but you’re not sure about the criteria, we still want to hear from you.*

=====================

* **We are on a mission** to make programming biology easy. We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.
* We're an **experienced team**. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!
* We're focused on building the **best possible team culture**. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.
* We offer **top of the market** salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.


**Responsibilities**:


As a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:

* Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools
* Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations
* Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process
* Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain
* Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.
* Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem

**Need to haves**
=================

* Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills
* You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.
* You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer\*, or even implement a UI plugin.
* You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.
* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**
=================

* Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.
* A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.
* You have worked with databases or big data systems.
* You have designed user interfaces and are familiar with one or more of the popular frameworks.
* You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.
* Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Cradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.**  

  

We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.


You will be joining a high-growth, highly ambitious startup with an experienced founding team, whose motivation is building a more sustainable world using biology. We are backed by some of the most well known investors and industry veterans. Joining us now means you will be getting in on the ground floor; you will have a significant impact on how we shape the company, and success will mean an outsized reward.

De diverse belangen van betrokken partijen neem je mee bij het bedenken, coördineren en schrijven van diverse uitingen, zoals het BKR-magazine Inzichtelijk, de externe nieuwsbrieven, de Schulden Monitor, diverse barometers, content voor socialmediakanalen en andere communicatiemiddelen zoals persberichten. Je ondersteunt daarnaast soms ook jouw teammanager als aanspreekpunt voor mediarelaties, persoptredens en klant- en arbeidsmarktcommunicatie.
Je bent werkzaam in team Marketing & Communicatie, dat op dit moment bestaat uit een Communicatieadviseur en een Medewerker Marketing & Communicatie. Je rapporteert aan de Teammanager Marketing & Communicatie, die tevens je leidinggevende is.

--------------------



We're looking for a creative powerhouse: an empathetic journalist and writer who produces phenomenal content that persuades, influences, and inspires. We're on a mission: to make banking better for everyone. And you'll play a crucial part in telling the story of how banking leaders in Europe can create better banking experiences for their customers and become a people-first bank.



As a content marketing specialist, you're a key member of Europe's demand generation team, where you'll take up the mantle of content producer and strategist. You will ideate, strategize on, and execute content creation for all stages of the buyer journey. You'll become intimately familiar with our product and will excel at expressing the value of our solution in a succinct, yet compelling way towards the different audiences that we speak to. From C-Suite executives to practitioners in their respective fields of technology or operations, you'll understand their most urgent concerns and interests, and you'll be able to provide them with valuable insights on the latest trends in the region, helpful guides that empower them to take action, and thoughtful perspectives to educate and inspire them.



As part of a multi-disciplinary Scrum team, you'll work together with other marketing specialists, including a digital marketer and a visual designer, while reporting to the Head of Marketing. You will also be part of the Communications Guild, where you'll contribute to evolving our content marketing best practices and be able to consult with the other content experts in the department to hone your craft. You'll collaborate closely with the Sales, Partner and Customer Success teams. Your passion for storytelling and content marketing will help drive dialogue with customers and prospects and support the demand generation goals in Europe.



Excited to do your best work at a supportive company that's willing to push the limits? Then read on.


**Meet the job**
----------------



Your key responsibilities


* Content strategy and creation - You will lead the content creation process, from strategy through to execution. You have a strong understanding of how to align, tweak and evolve the messaging for different personas, at different stages of the funnel, as well as for different channels. You will be the strategic content partner in Europe, proposing the different content assets needed to meet marketing goals, and will be responsible for delivering them.


Measure and improve content performance - You have a holistic approach to content and understand that your job isn't done simply when the words are written; you'll work closely with the designer to ensure that the final deliverable is formatted for optimal readability, and with the digital marketer to optimize it for maximum impact. You'll measure the impact of your content, analyze its performance and continuously look to improve it to meet (and exceed) campaign goals. You're committed to delivering content of the highest standards of quality in every way;
* Be the voice of the customer - The journalist in you loves talking to our colleagues in Sales and Customer Success, to our partners, and customers. You're hungry for knowledge and will proactively read up on the latest technology, business and fintech news to identify opportunities for content angles that we should jump on;


* Writing - You're the Swiss Army Knife of content writing, and are equally comfortable writing thoughtful long-form content such as ebooks, blog posts, and case studies, or in shorter, high-conversion copy such as ads and landing pages. You're also able to switch gears and take on more creative assets with ease, such as video scripts and event collateral. You will be one of the guardians of our brand's tone of voice, and will be a relentless perfectionist when it comes to grammar; you'll spot every single typo and errant punctuation mark in any content piece. Above all, you'll ensure that everything you deliver is engaging, compelling, and well worth the time for busy bankers to read.

  


**How about you**
-----------------


* You have a bachelor's degree in Marketing Communication, Journalism, or a related field;
* You speak, write, present, persuade, inspire and motivate in fluent English;
* You have 2-3 years experience in B2B marketing enterprise software solutions (experience in FinTech is a plus) and 5-7 years experience overall as a content writer and marketer;
* You have a data-driven mindset and are fluent in the metrics used to measure the impact of a content piece;
* You have strong project management skills and the ability to act decisively;
* You thrive on working in a fast-paced environment and are more than comfortable working on multiple projects at the same time;
* You are a true team player; someone who's hands-on, self-motivated, and an excellent communicator who can collaborate with a very international and diverse team to drive progress and hit deadlines together.",data journalist,https://grnh.se/5c66dbae1us,https://workatbackbase.com/,"Jacob Bontiusplaats 9, 1018 LL Amsterdam",Internet And Software,"501 to 1,000",,Powering the digital banking revolution.,https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/38bb29392721ac78814248b6571c73e0,https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_headerimage/1960x400/72096a70d6cb99a0b64f0a1f3d1763ed,,,da00ee67fd7bb48e,,en,,,

-------------------


  
Het ministerie van BZK ontvangt steeds meer en steeds omvangrijkere Woo-verzoeken. Om te zorgen voor de zorgvuldige én snelle afhandeling zoekt het ministerie enthousiaste en gedreven informatiespecialisten.


Als informatiespecialist werk je aan het efficiënt afhandelen van Woo-verzoeken. In Nederland heeft iedereen - burgers, bedrijven, het parlement en journalisten – recht op toegang tot informatie van de overheid. Dat is vastgelegd in de Wet open overheid (Woo), de opvolger van de Wet openbaarheid bestuur. Het is jouw taak om snel en zorgvuldig de benodigde documenten te vinden. Vervolgens beoordeel je de documenten en bereid je ze voor op openbaarmaking, door het lakken van de juiste informatie (zoals persoonsgegevens). Je werkt nauw samen met interne collega's, zoals dossierhouders en juristen, om ervoor te zorgen dat het proces soepel verloopt. Daarnaast draag je bij aan het verbeteren van onze processen door het implementeren van data-gedreven benaderingen en het verbeteren van onze tooling, zoals de laksoftware.


Je onderhoudt contacten met de collega’s binnen het ministerie en informeert betrokkenen over de voortgang van je werkzaamheden. Je signaleert snel problemen of stagnatie tijdens het afhandelingsproces en escaleert wanneer dat nodig is. Door goed samen te werken en oplossingsgericht te handelen, draag je bij aan een betere afhandeling van Woo-verzoeken.


Daarnaast werken we hard aan procesverbeteringen. Daarom willen wij het zoekproces naar relevante documenten steeds meer informatie gedreven inrichten, waarbij we gebruik maken van slimme tooling. Dat doe je als informatiespecialist door het bouwen van queries met de juiste zoektermen, om zo snel en gemakkelijk de relevantie documenten te vinden.


We zijn volop in ontwikkeling om dit te realiseren en zoeken nieuwe collega’s die hier hun steentje willen bijdragen. Ook draag je bij aan de doorontwikkeling van onze huidige instrumenten en tools, zoals onze laksoftware en de sturingsinformatie in ons dashboard.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
* Je hebt ervaring in een rol als zoekspecialist en met het structuren en doorzoekbaar maken van data;
* Je hebt ervaring met procesverbeteringen en weet die door te voeren;
* Je hebt affiniteit met datagedreven werken en kunt dit vertalen naar jouw functie;
* Je bent gewend te werken met ICT-tools, zoals laksoftware, tooling voor data-analyse, zoek&vind, etc.
* Je weet snel een weg te vinden in verschillende informatiebronnen, zoals ons documentmanagementsysteem, mailboxen en netwerkschijven;
* Je hebt kennis van wettelijke gronden waarop informatie beoordeeld dient te worden of bent bereid dit te leren;
* Je bent flexibel en je werkt graag oplossingsgericht;
* Je bent gewend om gestructureerd en waar nodig onder hoge tijdsdruk te werken;
* Je beschikt over uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.

  
Arbeidsvoorwaarden
------------------


  
* Salarisniveau schaal 10
* Maandsalaris Min €3.404 – Max. €5.389 (bruto)
* Dienstverband Arbeidsovereenkomst voor onbepaalde tijd
* Contractduur N.v.t. (in geval van vast dienstverband)
* Minimaal aantal uren per week 32
* Maximaal aantal uren per week 36

  
Overige arbeidsvoorwaarden
--------------------------


  
Naast het salaris ontvang je een Individueel Keuzebudget (IKB). Het IKB bestaat uit geld (16,37% van je bruto jaarsalaris) en tijd. Met het IKB maak jij de keuzes die bij jou passen en kun je een deel van je arbeidsvoorwaarden zelf samenstellen. Je kunt er bijvoorbeeld voor kiezen om een deel van je maandinkomen te laten uitbetalen wanneer jij dat wenst. Ook kun je dit budget omzetten in verlof en andersom of besteden aan fiscaal vriendelijke doelen. De Rijksoverheid hecht sterk aan persoonlijke groei en loopbaanontwikkeling en biedt daarvoor tal van mogelijkheden. Tot de secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden behoren onder meer verschillende studiefaciliteiten, bedrijfsfitness, volledige vergoeding van je OV-reiskosten woon-werkverkeer en gedeeltelijk betaald ouderschapsverlof.

---------------------------------------



In november 2023 is het Woo-team gestart om binnen BZK te zorgen voor een versnelling en verbetering in de afhandeling van Woo-verzoeken. Ons team heeft een centrale plek in de organisatie en ontlast de beleidsdirecties bij het afhandelen van Woo-verzoeken. We werken nauw samen met de juridische afdeling van BZK. In ons team werken informatiespecialisten en Woo-regisseurs samen om de Woo-verzoeker beter van dienst te zijn en te zorgen voor een vlot en open proces. De Woo-regisseur voert regie op het proces en onderhoudt contacten met de verzoeker. We maken nu een vervolgstap in de ontwikkeling van het team. Het Woo-team groeit in aantal collega’s, zodat we bij meer Woo-verzoeken ondersteuning kunnen bieden. Ook breiden we uit qua juridische expertise. Daarmee kunnen we ook meer stappen in het proces ondersteunen.



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**

Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.",data journalist,https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl/vacatures/informatiespecialist-woo-verzoeken-BZK-2024-0701,https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/ministerie-van-binnenlandse-zaken-en-koninkrijksrelaties,,,"5,001 to 10,000",,,,,,,57af6ec7f513cb63,,nl,,,

Stel de juiste prioriteiten. Vertaal beleid naar de praktijk. En draag bij aan de informatievoorziening rond 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken per jaar.



Wat doe je als Informatiemanager bij IVO Rechtspraak?



Jouw werk is van grote invloed op de rechtspraak. En daarmee op het leven van mensen. Want de rechtspraak kan niet zonder goede informatie. En die moet voor álle betrokkenen eenvoudig beschikbaar zijn. Van rechters tot burgers die door een geschil of misdaad in een rechtszaak zijn verwikkeld. Jij speelt een centrale rol in die informatievoorziening. Een opdracht op niveau, waarbij de prioriteiten die jij stelt of laat stellen het verschil maken!



Hoe je werk eruitziet



Ieder jaar zijn er zo’n 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken in Nederland. Binnen IVO Rechtspraak hebben we verschillende teams die zich bezighouden met informatievoorziening. In elk team stuurt een portefeuillehouder namens de business met een rechtsgebied als focus: straf, civiel en bestuur, toezicht, familie en jeugd, data en registers, en tot slot bedrijfsvoering. Jij bent de rechterhand van de portefeuillehouder en start bij het IV-team Bedrijfsvoering. De portefeuille Bedrijfsvoering levert generieke diensten aan Rechtspraak-collega's en externe partijen, zoals burgers, rechtzoekenden, journalisten en ketenpartners. De portefeuille is onderverdeeld in de volgende 5 thema's waarbinnen alle verschillende applicaties van Bedrijfsvoering zijn ondergebracht; klantgerichte communicatie en kennisportalen, slim samenwerken en online zitten, creëren en delen van uitspraken, facilitering bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen en digitale informatiehuishouding.



Samen met je collega-informatiemanagers breng jij in kaart welke informatie nodig is om rechtszaken en bedrijfsondersteunende processen optimaal te laten verlopen. Daar maak je voor jouw thema beleid op, ook voor de lange termijn. En je ziet toe op de uitvoering van dat beleid. Zo bouw je mee aan de digitale toekomst van de rechtspraak in ons land.



Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware 2 talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.



Zit je als informatiemanager graag dicht bij het vuur? En wil je de richting van de rechtspraak mee helpen bepalen? Stuur dan direct je sollicitatie!

 **Vacature**

**Communicatiemedewerker GGD** **(24 uur)**

 **Hoe ziet jouw toekomstige werkdag eruit?**  

Je start de werkdag goed met een lekkere kop koffie. Samen met je collega’s praat je bij over het weekend. Maar niet te lang, want aan het begin van de ochtend heb je meteen de weekstart van de GGD. Samen met je communicatiecollega’s bespreek je welke gezondheidsonderwerpen je de komende periode uitlicht. Dit doe je aan de hand van de omgevingsscan waarop je aanhaakt bij de behoefte van de inwoners, de contentplanning en ons jaarplan.


Hierna ga je gelijk aan de slag met het maken van content. De nieuwe social mediacampagne moet namelijk vandaag worden ingepland. Jij weet als geen ander hoe je met creatieve content de doelgroep kan bereiken. Naast je eigen kennis en ervaring, gebruik je hierbij de data en resultaten van eerdere, gelijksoortige campagnes.


De tijd vliegt en voor je het weet is het lunchtijd. Je loopt een rondje met je collega’s om even de benen te strekken. Als je terugkomt start een online meeting met een projectleider over een nieuwe voorlichtingscampagne. Je stelt vragen over doel, doelgroep en adviseert vervolgens over middelen.


Na de meeting neem je de tijd om je mail bij te werken. Je ontving een vraag van een journalist. Samen met de inhoudsdeskundige die de woordvoering doet, formuleer je de antwoorden op de vragen. Later deze week begeleid je het persmoment. Het laatste uur voer je een maandelijkse analyse uit om het gebruikersgedrag op de websites in beeld te brengen. Dit geeft weer nieuwe inzichten om de website te optimaliseren. Voldaan klap je je laptop dicht en verheug je je op morgen. Want morgen is weer een nieuwe dag die totaal anders kan zijn!

**Wat ga je doen?**  

Binnen onze veiligheidsregio hebben we de unieke combinatie van gezondheid (GGD) én veiligheid (Brandweer, Crisisbeheersing). Als communicatiemedewerker richt jij je op operationele taken van de GGD. Jouw werkgebied is breed en omvat afgebakende, uitvoerende werkzaamheden waarbij je nauw samenwerkt en spart met je communicatiecollega's.


Daarnaast zijn we een crisisorganisatie, wat betekent dat je ook bereid bent deel te nemen aan een communicatiepiket tijdens crisissituaties. Gemiddeld ben je 8 tot 10 keer per jaar een week lang bereikbaar en beschikbaar voor communicatieve werkzaamheden tijdens crisissituaties. Dit doe je samen met andere collega's die piket hebben die week.

**Jouw taken:**

* Content creatie: realiseren van boeiend en inspirerende content voor onze online en offline kanalen.
* Verhalen vertellen: complexe info omzetten in begrijpelijke en pakkende verhalen die onze doelgroep raken en betrekken.
* Social media: beheren van social media kanalen, toffe posts maken en interactie aangaan met onze volgers.
* Content organiseren: campagnes plannen en coördineren die ons merk en werk in de spotlight zetten.
* Huisstijl bewaken: bewaken en versterken van onze huisstijl in alle communicatie-uitingen
* Media contacten: opbouwen en onderhouden van relaties met de media, en zorgen voor positieve publiciteit en zichtbaarheid.
* Data checken: communicatiekanalen en communicatiecampagnes analyseren en data gebruiken om onze strategieën te verbeteren.
* Samenwerken: met verschillende teams en vormgever om communicatieprojecten van start tot finish te brengen.

**Wat breng je mee?**

* Diploma in communicatie of een vergelijkbare studie.
* Ervaring met traditionele en moderne communicatiemiddelen en campagnes.
* Top skills voor het maken pakkende teksten en beelden waarmee je onze doelgroep raakt.
* Sterk in vormgeving en bekend met tools, zoals Canva.
* Creatief brein met scherp oog voor detail.
* Sterke verbale en schriftelijke communicatie.
* Zelfstarter met een proactieve mindset.
* Analytisch vermogen om social media en websitedata om te zetten in slimme(re) communicatie.
* Echte teamplayer die graag samenwerkt.
* Passie voor verhalen vertellen en het bouwen van een sterk merk.
* Coachende vaardigheden en het vermogen om collega's te begeleiden en afdelingen te ondersteunen bij hun communicatie.

**Jouw team:**  

Je werkt in een leuk en enthousiast communicatieteam met 12 collega’s. Een team dat grotendeels bestaat uit jonge professionals, maar ook met enkele collega’s die al langer in het vak zitten. We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**  

Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA. Je komt te werken in een crisisorganisatie vol afwisseling. De coronacrisis, vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne, het hoogwater van de Maas of een grote brand. Wij waren erbij betrokken. Als communicatiemedewerker zit je bij ons nooit stil.


Je kunt je eigen werktijden en werkplek bepalen. Wij werken vanuit vertrouwen waarbij vrijheden en verantwoordelijkheden hand in hand gaan. Er zijn dus volop mogelijkheden om je privé- en werksituatie met elkaar te combineren.


Wij geven je de kans om te werken bij een organisatie met meerdere interessante en uitdagende werkvelden en een divers takenpakket. Binnen ons team zijn verschillende specialisaties aanwezig, waar jij als communicatiemedewerker van kunt leren en aan bij kunt dragen. Je kunt je bij ons helemaal uitleven.

* Alle faciliteiten om goed te kunnen werken, zoals een laptop en een telefoon;
* Een Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB). Het IKB is 18,63% van je brutoloon. Je kunt het IKB maandelijks naar eigen behoefte inzetten.

Van leidinggeven aan je collega’s tot het ontwikkelen van een visie voor onze unit: in deze veelzijdige rol zorg jij voor een soepele informatieverstrekking aan onze partners.

Waarom goede Informatieverstrekking vanuit de RDW belangrijk is?

“Hoe mooi is het dat we overheidsorganisaties helpen hun taken goed uit te voeren? Zo dragen we bij aan een leefbaar en verkeersveilig Nederland.

Werken aan de mobiliteit van morgen  
Van de politie die informatie opvraagt over een kenteken tot een journalist die onderzoeksvragen heeft over kentekens en rijbewijzen in Nederland: als unitmanager zorg jij dat alle externe partijen op tijd de juiste informatie krijgen. Je geeft leiding aan collega’s en zet hen in hun kracht, ontwikkelt strategische plannen en realiseert afspraken en doelen volgens het managementcontract.

Daarnaast ben je teamlid van het managementteam van de afdeling, met wie je het beleid ontwikkelt en afstemt. We zijn volop bezig met de doorontwikkeling van onze afdeling. Jij helpt ons de volgende stap te zetten: je kijkt hoe we onze dienstverlening beter kunnen structureren en professionaliseren, bijvoorbeeld met de inzet van data-intelligence. Je houdt externe ontwikkelingen in de gaten, vertaalt deze naar onze afdeling en je unit en zet kansen voor innovatie om in projecten. Daarvoor werk je nauw samen met ICT-serviceteams om te zorgen dat de oplossingen onze doelen ondersteunen. Ook ben je opdrachtgever van stuurgroepen bij multidisciplinaire projecten.

Dit is jouw thuisbasis  
Jouw unit Informatieverstrekking bestaat uit zo'n 32 collega’s en je geeft direct leiding aan de teammanagers, unitadviseurs en onder andere de medewerkers die zich bezighouden met privacy en security. We vormen een hechte club: we zijn betrokken, staan altijd voor elkaar klaar en hebben oog voor wie jij bent, als collega én als mens. Ook organiseren we leuke teamuitjes om onze band te versterken. Door je centrale rol in onze organisatie ben je vaak op kantoor te vinden, maar thuiswerken kan ook: jij voelt goed aan wanneer dat kan!

Vertaal beleid naar de praktijk. En draag bij aan de informatievoorziening rond 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken per jaar.**


**Wat doe je als Informatiemanager bij IVO Rechtspraak?**
---------------------------------------------------------


Jouw werk is van grote invloed op de rechtspraak. En daarmee op het leven van mensen. Want de rechtspraak kan niet zonder goede informatie. En die moet voor álle betrokkenen eenvoudig beschikbaar zijn. Van rechters tot burgers die door een geschil of misdaad in een rechtszaak zijn verwikkeld. Jij speelt een centrale rol in die informatievoorziening. Een opdracht op niveau, waarbij de prioriteiten die jij stelt of laat stellen het verschil maken!


### **Hoe je werk eruitziet**


Ieder jaar zijn er zo’n 1,5 miljoen rechtszaken in Nederland. Binnen IVO Rechtspraak hebben we verschillende teams die zich bezighouden met informatievoorziening. In elk team stuurt een portefeuillehouder namens de business, met een rechtsgebied als focus: straf, civiel en bestuur, toezicht, familie en jeugd, Data en Registers en tot slot bedrijfsvoering. Jij bent de rechterhand van de portefeuillehouder en start bij het IV-team Bedrijfsvoering. De portefeuille Bedrijfsvoering levert generieke diensten aan Rechtspraak collega's en externe partijen, zoals burgers, rechtzoekenden, journalisten en ketenpartners. De portefeuille is onderverdeeld in de volgende vijf thema's waarbinnen alle verschillende applicaties van Bedrijfsvoering zijn ondergebracht; klantgerichte communicatie en kennisportalen, slim samenwerken en online zitten, creëren en delen van uitspraken, facilitering bedrijfsvoeringsprocessen en digitale informatiehuishouding


Samen met je collega-informatiemanagers breng jij in kaart welke informatie nodig is om rechtszaken en bedrijfsondersteunende processen optimaal te laten verlopen. Daar maak je voor jouw thema beleid op, ook voor de lange termijn. En je ziet toe op de uitvoering van dat beleid. Zo bouw je mee aan de digitale toekomst van de rechtspraak in ons land.


Aan de ene kant praat je met de mensen die onze informatie gebruiken. Denk aan rechters, advocaten of aan belangenorganisaties zoals de Kinderbescherming, Slachtofferhulp of beroepsverenigingen. Aan de andere kant maak je de vertaalslag naar de ontwerpers en ontwikkelaars van de nodige informatieoplossingen. Je spreekt dus als het ware twee talen. Je weet ook wat er leeft, zowel in onze organisatie als daaromheen. Daar anticipeer je op. En natuurlijk volg je de laatste IT-trends.


Zit je als informatiemanager graag dicht bij het vuur? En wil je de richting van de rechtspraak mee helpen bepalen? Stuur dan direct je sollicitatie!

Van werkstress tot machineveiligheid en van hybride werken tot gevaarlijke stoffen. Arbo is het platform dat arboprofessionals ondersteunt in hun dagelijks werk. Door ze te informeren over ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken. Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.  

  

**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.



Als hoofdredacteur Arbo ben je onderdeel van de centrale redactie van het ‘professionals portfolio’ van VMN media, waar ook PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb onderdeel van zijn. Samen zijn we een team van 14 personen.

 **Wat krijg je:**

* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.
