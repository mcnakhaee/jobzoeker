----------------


Are you a Bachelor or a Master student in computer science or a related field? Are you interested in making a difference by streamlining the current tooling that ASML's Machine Control group use, and improving the diagnostic workflow of our users? Then this internship could be interesting for you!

**Background information**

Within the Machine Control group, we are responsible for orchestrating and synchronizing all high-level behavioral actions. We have a large number of modules working in parallel in a large configuration space. Due to the large scale and complexity of the system, there is a need for an abstracted overview of the system.

  

We need such an overview for multiple reasons. It can be used to improve the overall understanding of the system, and it can be used by experts to quickly diagnose unexpected behavior, considerably reducing investigation time.

  

Currently, the process of creating such an overview is mostly manual and labor-intensive task sometimes assisted by rudimentary tooling. The existing tooling does not support diagnostics enough due to low user-friendliness and missing features.

**Assignment description**

The aim of your project is to take the existing tooling as a starting point, polish and extend it such that it can better facilitate diagnostics of the system behavior. In this assignment you will:

* Gather the needs of the experts;
* Ensure the system stores the data required to generate the overview;
* Streamline the tooling to improve the diagnostic workflow of the user;
* Closely interact with users to iteratively create a polished product.

**Your Profile**
----------------


To be a perfect fit for this assignment, you:

* Have background in Computer Science or related;
* Are a bachelor student looking to do your thesis (bachelor graduation project/thesis), or a master student looking to gain work experience (master apprentice);
* Are able to translate functional requirements and design in to software designs;
* Are experienced in Python (required), and experienced in C and/or C++ is a bonus.
* Have knowledge in diagnostic methods (preferred);


Other requirements you need to meet:

* You are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship;
* You need to be located in the Netherlands to be perform your internship. In case you ‘re currently living/studying outside of the Netherlands, please include in your CV/motivation letter willingness to relocate.

Then we have an opportunity for you.

  



**Job Description**  

In the plastic packaging value chain, there is only limited information available on the plastics in that chain to assess circularity and recyclability goals, especially the use of post-consumer recyclates (PCR) in packaging.

  


Quality specifications, monitoring, and standardisation of materials are common in certain industries like chemistry and pharma but are, at this point, only in an infancy state in plastic waste management. A major challenge when it comes to mechanical recycling of plastics is that the quality of the material is not monitored throughout the whole process. Inline monitoring is however essential for predicting the final quality of PCR.

  


In the MoQuP-R project, we focus on the necessary quality monitoring tools and the application of existing models related to the prediction of recyclate quality in order to increase the use of PCR in packaging. In this project your responsibilities will entail:


* Review literature to identify potential inline analytical methods to monitor quality parameters.
* Adapt laboratory and/or offline analytical techniques to be used inline in polymer processing equipment.
* Propose and execute design changes to polymer processing equipment to enable inline measurements.
* Design experiments using polymer processing equipment and post-consumer plastics to apply and develop monitoring tools.
* Evaluate the different methods in relation to PCR quality.
* Manage a work package in the MoQuP-R project.
* Present your work at international conferences, MoQuP-R consortium meetings, and other events and write scientific papers for international peer-reviewed journals.
* Provide teaching assistance and/or supervision of researchers and students.

  




As a Postdoctoral Researcher you will work in the Circular Plastics team in the Faculty of Science and Engineering located at Brightlands Chemelot Campus in Geleen. You will become part of a young international research group, specialized in the mechanical recycling of plastics with a strong polymer science background. Your will work together with Rudinei Fiorio on this exciting topic.

  


**Requirements**  

We expect you to have the following experience, knowledge, and skills:


* A PhD degree in mechanical engineering, polymer engineering, process analysis, mechatronics, or similar;
* Advanced skills in CAD and interfacing sensor data to analysis software (e.g. Python, Matlab, Simulink);
* Good knowledge on analytical techniques such as rheology, spectroscopy, GCMS;
* Skills in polymer processing;
* Experience with industry collaborations is considered advantageous;
* Proficiency in both written and spoken English.

At Booking.com, data drives our decisions. Technology is at our core. And innovation is everywhere. But our company is more than datasets, lines of code or A/B tests. We’re the thrill of the first night in a new place. The excitement of the next morning. The friends you make. The journeys you take. The sights you see. And the food you sample. Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.
As a Senior Machine Learning Scientist, you will be a strong technical leader within the team, setting the technical strategy, while generating operational business impact. You will be developing state-of-the-art Machine Learning models, owning the design and delivery of ML systems, from initial idea-generation, collecting business requirements from product stakeholders to implementation. You will actively coach and mentor less experienced Machine Learning Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers in the team and work closely together with Data Engineers, Software Engineers and Product Managers.### **Key Job Responsibilities**

* Translate broad business problems into ML/AI challenges and develop a targeted research plan to identify the best approach within the constraints of the production environment.
* Develop the technical strategy for machine learning on a product family by designing innovative ML/AI models, algorithms, and approaches that deliver both short-term commercial impact and longer-term differentiated business value and customer experiences.
* Work in a multi-disciplined team where you’ll take full ownership of turning discoveries and ideas into products through machine learning (incl. understanding product requirements, data discovery, model development and evaluation, to implementation of a full production pipeline for both batch and stream-based deployment).
* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.

* We prefer candidates with Deep Learning experience, especially when applied to large-scale datasets. Experience with TensorFlow is a plus.
* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).
* Excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal; the ability to convey your message to team members and other collaborators.

Through our products, partners, and people, we make it easier for everyone to experience the world.### **Team and Role Overview**


Ensuring we understand the needs and intentions of our travelers remains a top priority for Booking. With millions of accommodations, flights, taxis, attractions, and car rentals available on our platform, our aim is to assist customers in finding the perfect fit for their journey. Customers may express their needs and intentions directly through their searches or filter usage, while in addition we can further deduct their preferences from their interactions on our platform, such as clicking on specific accommodations rather than others. At Booking, we consistently analyze and model customer behavior to personalize the traveler experience.
Following successful user intent and needs modeling across various parts of the company, these efforts have recently been consolidated into a central team, and as part of the **Traveler Centric Data track** within the new **Marketplace business unit** we are now expanding further. The **User Intent Modelling team** is building upon past successes, while also deepening on innovation to push the boundaries for personalisation even further by leveraging innovative Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. It is a crucial aspect of the Marketplace vision to ensure we guide our travelers to the most suitable products and facilitate seamless connections between the various parts of their trip.

* Define and build proof-of-concepts to test new ideas and demonstrate their potential value to relevant stakeholders.
* Develop production-grade ML code for models, features, and pipelines, accounting for scalability, latency, realtime requirements, monitoring and retraining.
* Build readable and reusable code, using the right technologies and coding methodologies applying knowledge of business area tools and product needs.
* Continuously evolve your craft by keeping up to date with the latest developments in ML/AI and related technologies, introducing them to the machine learning community and promoting their application.
* Promote platform-based development and reuse by coaching teams in abstracting individual business problems to generalized ML/AI products, rather than point solutions, and in identifying horizontal opportunities across multiple business domains.
* Maintain a highly cross-disciplinary perspective, solving issues by applying approaches and methods from across a variety of ML/AI disciplines and related fields. Coach others through evidence and clear communication, explaining advanced technical concepts in simpler terms.
* Actively contribute to Machine Learning at Booking.com through training, exploration of new technologies, interviewing, onboarding and mentoring colleagues.

### **Role Qualifications and Required Skills**

* Strong relevant work and/or academic experience (MSc + 8 years of working experience, or PhD + 6 years), involved in the development and application of Machine Learning.

* Ability to design an applied research plan for a product family from scratch as evidenced by peer-review publication or similar track record.
* Experience on multiple machine learning facets: working with large data sets, model development, statistics, experimentation, data visualization, optimization, software development.
* Prior experience with Feature Engineering and putting machine learning models in production is a plus.
* Strong working knowledge of Python, Hadoop, SQL, Spark or similar Big Data technologies.
* Experience collaborating cross functionally in the development of machine learning products (e.g. Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, etc.).
* Excellent English communication skills, both written and verbal; the ability to convey your message to team members and other collaborators.

Then this is the perfect job for you!
  
Knab was founded in 2012. We are an online bank, but one run by real people. We are known for being different because we want to do things differently. Simpler, smarter, and more affordable for our customers. By combining smart technology with a healthy dose of common sense, we create financial services that meet your needs. We add sublime, personal service to this, creating something unique in the financial sector.  

  

**Your role and responsibilities**  

Are you passionate about problem solving and combining the use of different tools in your daily work? And are you interested in the interest rate risk and enjoy improving processes? As a Senior ALM Specialist you will be responsible for managing and modelling interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) in a small and engaged team.  

  

Furthermore, the role will include at least the following:


* Managing the interest rate risk through hedging and designing optimal risk steering;
* Developing and refining interest rate related models (e.g. non-maturing deposits, cash flows, prepayments, mortgage pipeline, hedge accounting);
* Shaping decision-making, policies and analyses for senior management;
* Reporting the IRRBB and FX position to ALCO;
* Staying up-to-date with the latest changes in regulation (i.e. EBA, BCBS 239) related to IRRBB management;
* Enhancing reporting processes with regard to the automation and quality of the reported data;
* Assisting junior team members in their professional development.


The current interest rate environment and changes in EBA IRRBB regulation make it a very dynamic and exciting time to be part of a first-line of defence ALM team. The combination of the current economic climate, a flat-structured bank and a wide range of projects offer you a great opportunity to grow professionally and develop a holistic view on interest rate risk of the bank.  

  

**The team**  

The Asset and Liability Management & Methodology (ALM&M) team’s goal is to deliver on Knab’s strategy by optimizing the balance sheet of Knab. We do this by ensuring that the interest rate risk and funding positions of Knab are managed within the boundaries set in the strategies for those risks whilst not losing sight of the profitability of the bank.  

  

We believe in assigning ownership instead of tasks and, as a result, everyone within the ALM&M team gets the chance to own and be in the lead of a focus area within our team. This creates a flat structure which enables people to take initiative and develop their professional career on their own terms.  

  

On a personal side, we are a fun and multi-national team of curious and knowledgeable people. We perceive work as a challenge to improve ourselves and the bank. We like to work together and learn from each other through regular knowledge sharing sessions. We also enjoy spending time together outside of the work (e.g. having a drink or a game of padel.

To be successful in this role, this is the kind of traits we have in mind:


* Completed masters degree in (Quantitative) Finance, Econometrics, Mathematics, Physics or similar;
* 5-7 years of relevant working experience in financial modelling, ALM or balance sheet management;
* Experience with Python, R, VBA (Excel) or C++ is a must, SQL is a plus;
* Experience with ALM / risk software solutions such as QRM or Ambit Focus is preferred;
* Ability to communicate complex ideas in clear and concise way;
* Self-starter with the ability, agility and motivation for self-learning;
* Excellent control of the English language, both written and verbally. Dutch is a bonus.


Did you know that according to research, women are less likely to apply than men when they don't meet all the job requirements? What a shame. Because, in our view, 'the perfect candidate' is a myth. So, if you have the drive to grow in aspects of this role, we look forward to your application.

The WSG group focuses on the water-food-climate nexus, a critical area of research within the Earth Systems and Global Change (ESC) framework. . We study interactions between water resources and crop production as modulated by climate change and climate variability. To this end we develop and use models integrating crop development, growth, nutrient uptake and transpiration, both in potential and water or nutrient limited conditions. We couple these two models simulating water availability from surface and ground water, including irrigation systems and reservoirs (VIC), as well as water quality aspects. With such coupled models we study contemporary, near- and far-future mutual potentials and constraints, globally as well as for large basins and regions.  

  

We also aim to contribute to solutions by quantifying the effects of a diversity of potential adaptation strategies to increase magnitude and resilience of crop production at scales ranging from farm to globe. Climate time scales can be historic to real time (reanalysis), seasonal forecasts as well climate change scenarios (CMIP6). We engage with stakeholders worldwide to empower them to transition towards a more sustainable future.

=====================

* **We are on a mission** to make programming biology easy. We provide biologists with the software, machine learning & services to discover, design and optimise enzymes and their cell-factories to ultimately produce almost anything.
* We're an **experienced team**. We have built many successful products before and we have raised enough funds to have plenty of runway for the years to come!
* We're focused on building the **best possible team culture**. We're distributed across two locations, and are flexible about when and where we work.
* We offer **top of the market** salary, a generous equity stake in the company and a wide range of benefits from health and wellbeing, financial, to training and career progression opportunities.

**This is Cradle**
==================


Cradle helps teams to engineer proteins with fewer, more successful experiments. We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. We are bridge builders who bring together the best of machine learning, synthetic biology, developer tools, and user experience design. Our mission is to enable a world where most of the products around us can be easily made and degraded biologically using a cell-factory instead of (petro-)chemicals, plants or animal agriculture.


In software we have an almost infinite degree of freedom on designing solutions. We at Cradle want to use this flexibility to provide a new level of experience for biological engineers. These engineers work on optimising proteins (sequences of amino acids), which currently includes a lot of expert knowledge and manual steps. We want to revolutionise their processes and build a ‘photoshop for proteins’ supported by machine learning. On that mission we deal with complex user objectives, diverse data structures and physical lab interactions while offering an easy to use, low code user interface.

**What we are looking for**
===========================


For this challenge we are looking for full stack software engineers who are excited to peek out of the virtual world and join us on designing a platform for optimizing biological systems. Be ready to witness first hand what happens when you leave the bits and bytes behind and try to solve challenges with nature’s constraints and complexity.


**Responsibilities**:


As a full stack software engineer, you would be responsible to:

* Develop a decoupled, service oriented platform application powered by sophisticated machine learning tools
* Implement lightweight and modularized web-based user interfaces and visualizations
* Support the team in establishing a stable, high quality and flexible software engineering process
* Collaborate with biologists, machine learning experts and scientists alike and learn to understand their domain
* Work in a cloud native runtime environment using Google Cloud, Kubernetes, helm, docker et al.
* Integrate a variety of existing tools for biological processes in the Cradle ecosystem

**Need to haves**
=================

* Strong algorithmic and problem solving skills
* You enjoy designing software systems. We are in an early stage of the company where you will majorly contribute to the software design of the product.
* You are excited about all parts of the software stack which is reflected in your past projects. At any given day you could be asked to extend a web server API, contribute to a codon optimizer\*, or even implement a UI plugin.
* You are interested and excited about learning a new domain. You will be faced with a lot of new concepts and enjoy learning diverse topics.
* You have excellent knowledge of software development best practices, including code reviews, version control, and CI/CD pipelines.
* You are able to communicate well. We are working at the intersection of biology and software where good communication is key.
* You write readable code. Cradle aims to build a team of excellent computer scientists which includes advanced coding skills. We are set but not fixed on coding in Python at the moment.
* You are kind and work well both independently and in teams. We look for team players who contribute to a positive and friendly working environment.
* Do a little research online if you don’t know what this is :)

**Nice to haves**
=================

* Extensive knowledge of the Python programming language and its ecosystem.
* A solid understanding of application development lifecycle, testing principles, and agile practices.
* You have worked with databases or big data systems.
* You have designed user interfaces and are familiar with one or more of the popular frameworks.
* You have been working on production systems for machine learning applications.
* Experience in building containerized backend systems using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Cradle helps biologists design improved proteins in record time using powerful prediction algorithms and AI design suggestions.**  

  

We use generative machine learning models, accessible through user-friendly software interfaces, to help engineer protein properties such as stability, expression, activity, binding affinity and specificity. Our mission is to ultimately help more people build with biology and replacing traditional farms and factories for a more sustainable world.


You will be joining a high-growth, highly ambitious startup with an experienced founding team, whose motivation is building a more sustainable world using biology. We are backed by some of the most well known investors and industry veterans. Joining us now means you will be getting in on the ground floor; you will have a significant impact on how we shape the company, and success will mean an outsized reward.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

The sub-team focusing on ESG Data has been active for almost a year. As a member of this team, the goal is to collaboratively build an ESG Data platform with IT Developers to supply the team involved in Sustainable Finance Regulation Modelling with the necessary data to monitor ESG risk.  

  

Given the significance that regulatory authorities attribute to modelling and the underlying data, this role is challenging and impactful. The Sustainable Finance Regulation project is a new and excellent opportunity to become familiar with this development. Tasks related to this project, which involve building the platform, include:  

  

* Inventory of the playing field with all stakeholders and parties involved;
* Collection of all data requirements for the models;
* Gap analysis of the data requirements for the SFR regulation and the data already available on the platform;
* Planning of the delivery of the required data;
* Actual delivery of dataset to the consumers.


  

Once the platform is ready, you will be involved in the data collection process. Your duties will encompass technical aspects such as SQL and Python programming, performing Data Quality analyses, and integrating datasets. Simultaneously, you'll be working on documentation and utilizing your communicative skills for stakeholder alignment. Active participation in frequent team meetings, where knowledge-sharing and progress transparency are key, is also expected. In this role, everything revolves around data modelling, along with related activities:  

  

* Discussing data requirements for different ESG risk models and reports with the modellers and reporting analysts;
* Make an inventory of the relevant databases within the bank and gain access to them;
* Combine tables (merge / link) and aggregate data in SQL and Python;
* Apply Data Quality Analysis, for example, course over time, missing values, extreme values;
* Investigate the plausibility of the new data;
* Document the data sourcing process and descriptive statistics and discuss this with the business parties;
* Additionally, there are many ad hoc activities, and you will regularly participate in cross-departmental projects. Your ability and willingness to collaborate are crucial for success in this role. You naturally take initiative, organize work effectively, and eagerly work with others to deliver tangible results. You possess a practical, analytical approach and strong communication and presentation skills. Being a robust team player, you take responsibility for your work. In the dynamic environment in which you operate, you have the ability to get all stakeholders on board.

-------------------

 **Do you want to commit to a critical challenge and help to shape our future?**


We keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages, and configuration errors.


We are looking for a team member who is driven by technical challenges and the urge to always find better and more efficient ways of delivering services to the customer.  

  

**What will you do?**


In the role as SRE engineer you will combine the skillset of dev teams and operations teams by applying a software engineering approach to IT operations.


To succeed in this role it is important that you are self-driven, exact, analytic, critical and know how to prioritize. You are not only an expert in your field but you also have social competence and understand the business needs. You always challenge yourself and others to improve. You are also open for suggestions from others and can also give your own.


You are a team player and have a hands-on mindset, a strong customer- and problem-solving orientation. You show fast results, and you have demonstrated good communication skills, especially in an international organization. You need to be able to work independently in an international team that meets more virtually than physically.

  

  

**Your tasks and responsibilities:**

**Maintaining Applications to Help Operations and Support Teams**


As a SRE you are in charge of proactively implementing and maintaining infrastructure and business applications. This can be anything from provisioning servers, updating systems, deploying new software, providing pre-emptive maintenance to monitoring and alerting to code changes in production. A site reliability engineer can be tasked with building a homegrown tool from scratch to help with weaknesses in software delivery or incident management.


You must always be looking to improve quality and efficiency and cut costs.

**Fixing Support Escalation Issues**


Similarly to the point above, a site reliability engineer can be expected to spend time fixing support escalation cases.

**Optimizing On-Call Rotations and Processes**


More times than not, site reliability engineers will need to take on-call responsibilities and improve system reliability through the optimization of on-call processes. You will help add automation and context to alerts – leading to better real-time collaborative response from on-call responders. Additionally, you will update runbooks, tools and documentation to help prepare your on-call team members for future incidents.

**Documenting “Tribal” K****nowledge**


As you gain exposure to systems in both staging and production, as well as all technical teams, you will take part in work with software development, support, IT operations and on-call duties – meaning you will build up a great amount of historical knowledge over time. Instead of keeping this knowledge in the mind of one team or one person, as SRE you are expected to document much of what you know. Constant upkeep of documentation and runbooks can ensure teams get the information they need right when they need it.

**Conducting Post-Incident Reviews**


Without thorough post-incident reviews, you have no way to identify what’s working and what’s not. As such you will be participating in post-incident reviews, documenting your findings and taking action on your learnings.


Maybe also add \""provision new servers\""... it is attractive to have a more technical approach to woo away developers and coordinators!

 **Location**  

  

Katowice, Gliwice, Amsterdam or Solna

**Jouw profiel**
----------------

 **Who are you?**  

  

As our Site Reliability Engineer you:

* Are an expert in your field, strong technical and analytical skills, can solve impossible problems.
* Have the ability to translate complicated technical matters into simple understandable language.

* Have thorough knowledge of operating systems (Linux/Windows 2019 and up).
* Work with Agile methodology.
* Have experience in troubleshooting and root cause analysis.

* Experience with a wide range of observability practices (SLOs, Dashboards, Alerts,..) for business-critical systems

 **What we offer**

* **Diverse and internationally distributed team**: joining our team means becoming part of a large, global community with people of more than 90 nationalities. We're more than just colleagues; we're a group of professionals with a shared mission to connect diverse cultures. Our global presence is growing–we've doubled in size nearly every year, with our employees based in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the US, and Japan, and we continue to expand our network.


* **Open communication, regular feedback**: as a language-focused company, we value the importance of clear, honest communication. We value smooth collaboration, direct and actionable feedback, and believe that leading with empathy makes us better together.


* **Remote work, flexible hours**: whether you're near or in our hubs in cities like Cologne, Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Austin, or Tokyo, or prefer the comfort of your own home, you decide where your office is. We offer remote opportunities, flexible working hours and trust in your productivity, all in sync with your team's general locations and time zones to foster effective and seamless collaboration. Our aim is to integrate your work with your lifestyle, ensuring a balance that respects both your needs and our operational requirements.


* **Regular in-person team events**: we bond over vibrant events that are as unique as our team, from local team and business unit gatherings, to new-joiner onboardings and company-wide events that bring us all together–literally.


* **Monthly full-day hacking sessions**: every month, we have Hack Fridays, where you can spend your time diving into a project you're passionate about and get the opportunity to work with other teams–we value your initiatives, impact, and creativity.


* **Comprehensive health insurance**: your health comes first. With our comprehensive insurance, we'll make sure you're covered from head to toe.


* **30 days of annual leave**: we value your peace of mind. With up to 30 days off (excluding public holidays) and access to mental health resources, we make sure you're as strong mentally as you are professionally.
* **Annual learning budget**: because we never stop learning, we’ve set up an annual budget for your professional development—pick a learning path which contributes to your career development and we'll back you up.

  


**If this role and our mission resonate with you, but you're hesitant because you don't check all the boxes, don't let that hold you back. At DeepL, it's about the value you bring and the growth we can foster together. Go ahead, apply—let's discover your potential together. We can't wait to meet you!**

* Apply Data Quality Analysis, for example, course over time, missing values, extreme values;
* Investigate the plausibility of the new data;
* Document the data sourcing process and descriptive statistics and discuss this with the business parties;
* Additionally, there are many ad hoc activities, and you will regularly participate in cross-departmental projects. Your ability and willingness to collaborate are crucial for success in this role. You naturally take initiative, organize work effectively, and eagerly work with others to deliver tangible results. You possess a practical, analytical approach and strong communication and presentation skills. Being a robust team player, you take responsibility for your work.

The opening is for a research position within the field of computational science, mathematical or theoretical biology, computational physics, or applied mathematics. This Postdoc project is part of the Gravitation programme GreenTE (Green Tissue Engineering), a multidisciplinary consortium of 7 Dutch universities. Together, GreenTE will unravel how plants sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. These fundamental insights will be the basis to develop engineering interventions to improve plant regeneration, seed longevity and defenses against disease. The successful applicant will be an integral member of the GreenTE community, which offers an open, diverse and inspiring environment to engage in multidisciplinary mechanobiology research at the intersection of biology, chemistry and physics, and is expected to participate in GreenTE events, training and collaborations.


**Key responsibilities**


* Develop novel, three-dimensional simulation techniques suitable for modeling the mechanical regulation of plant development and regeneration in close collaboration with members of the GreenTE consortium.
* Integrate the new techniques into the plant modeling package VirtualLeaf .
* Design simulation experiments to reflect and interpret mechanical manipulation of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana as performed elsewhere in the GreenTE consortium.
* Incorporate detailed insights into the model of the mechanical properties of cell walls based on experiments and simulations at the subcellular level as developed elsewhere in the GreenTE consortium.
* Collaborate with a PhD student working in our group, also within GreenTE, to extend two-dimensional models of mechanical regulation of plant development to three dimensions and to validate these against experimental data produced elsewhere in the consortium.
* Publication of the results in the scientific literature.


**Selection Criteria**


* A PhD degree in applied mathematics, computational/theoretical physics, theoretical biology, computer science or a related discipline;
* Written and oral proficiency in English, strong scientific writing skills;
* Ability to work independently in a multidisciplinary environment;
* Fluent interdisciplinary communication skills with scientists in cell biology and mathematics;
* Keen interest in cell and developmental biology of plants;
* Experience in (numerical) mathematical modeling (e.g., Cellular Potts modeling, vertex-based modeling, particle-based simulations, PDEs);
* Great skills and enthusiasm for scientific programming in C++, Cuda and/or Python.


**Multiscale Mathematical Biology -** The work will be embedded in the Multiscale Mathematical Biology team at the Mathematical Institute and the Institute of Biology Leiden, both at the Faculty of Science at Leiden University. The team carries out mathematical biology research in close interaction with its own experimental work and that of collaborators.

It’s important that we embrace this journey but also positively support each other. In practice, this can range from pair programming to travelling and celebrating together.

 ***We do it right:*** When you’re moving fast it can be tempting to constantly cut corners to things done. But this results in a product that is a struggle to work with and has unhappy users. We make that extra effort to be proud of what we’re building; understand the problem we’re solving, write one more test or tackle technical debt.

 ***We are empowered to act, challenge and lead:*** To work effectively as a team everyone must have a voice and feel they can stand up and be counted. As a software engineer at Returnista we want you to feel empowered. That could mean proposing new ideas, fixing things without seeking permission or challenging the CEO.

 ***We are intrepid:*** We want our engineers to show initiative and to innovate. Intrepid Friday’s give us the opportunity to work on things that might not ostensibly be the highest priority, but can make a big difference to our product or how we work.

The selection criteria, set out in this Vacancy Notice, will be assessed by the Selection Committee throughout the different stages of the selection procedure. Before the start of the selection procedure, the Selection Committee will decide which selection criteria will be used at each stage of the selection procedure. Certain selection criteria will be assessed only for shortlisted candidates during a written test and/or a competency-based interview.  

  

The Selection Committee will assess the applications received in order to make an initial selection of those candidates meeting all eligibility criteria and matching best the selection criteria (suitability).

* Participate in the team’s effort towards data cleaning, data management, data analysis, and data visualization.
* Contribute towards the drafting of key findings, research reports and articles.
* Suggest ways to improve methodologies, scoring guidelines, research workflows, and analytical techniques.

* At least three years of professional research experience in relevant fields.

* Strong verbal and written English communication skills; able to write clearly and concisely for professional audiences. Additional language skills are a plus.
* Solid grasp of applied statistics and data analysis as well as familiarity with database querying and spreadsheets. Ability to script in R or Python is a plus.

* Strong interest in research, especially on corporate performance on sustainable development and the business and policy environments that shape that performance.
* Passion for making a difference with a curious mindset and a ‘can do’, hands-on and professional attitude.
* Potential to thrive in a teal culture based on self-managed teams, able to take initiative, self-reflect and collaborate with colleagues.
* Comfortable in a globally inclusive, multi-cultural, fast-paced, agile, and virtual/hybrid environment that promotes flexibility whilst being able to meet deadlines.

**What are you going to do**  

The Postdoc will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.  

The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and one Postdoc, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie!**

**Wie zoeken wij?**

Voor ons hoofdkantoor in Amersfoort zoeken wij per direct een AI Solutions Developer.

In deze rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verkennen en implementeren van de mogelijkheden van generative AI, zoals ChatGPT, om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren.

Je hebt een relevante WO-opleiding afgerond of bijna afgerond, zoals Informatica of Data Science, en beschikt over aantoonbare kennis en interesse op het gebied van AI, machine learning en data-analyse. Daarnaast heb je sterke analytische vaardigheden en ben je in staat om complexe technische problemen op te lossen. Ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python, R of Java is een vereiste, evenals kennis van cloud computing en ervaring met platforms zoals AWS, Azure of Google Cloud.

Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief samen te werken in een team zijn van essentieel belang. Je bent proactief, leergierig en kunt goed omgaan met veranderingen en uitdagingen. Daarnaast heb je een sterke drive om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en ICT-management.

**Wat ga je doen?**

Deze functie is nieuw binnen Lab21, wat betekent dat je een grote invloed hebt op de invulling ervan. Je zult een onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren. Als Junior ICT Manager speel je een belangrijke rol bij het implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen binnen ons bedrijf. Je werkt nauw samen met verschillende teams om de behoeften van de organisatie in kaart te brengen en technologische oplossingen aan te dragen. Je analyseert en optimaliseert bestaande systemen en processen en identificeert kansen om AI-technologieën toe te passen.

**Plaats in de organisatie:**

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

**Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst ken jij onze klant het beste. Deze kennis verkrijg je door gebruik te maken van data (zoals bijvoorbeeld data over koopgedrag), om zo de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van data-oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk met de nieuwste data analytics technieken. Je maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Analytics & Data Science team, en bent daarmee onderdeel van de grotere Analytics community binnen Albert Heijn. Je beweegt makkelijk tussen Tech, Data Science en de business teams, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data analytics toepassingen. Je maakt impact als Data Analist door:

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

**Max hours per week:** 38,00  

**Max salary:** 3.298  

**Duration of agreement:** 5 months  

**Apply until:** 11 August 2024  


**What will you be doing?**
Historically-collected, long-term datasets are some of the most valuable assets in ecology and environmental science. Their preservation is of paramount importance, especially in light of ongoing environmental change. Yet many such datasets remain effectively inaccessible because they are not publicly shared or, more concerningly, only exist in non-digital or obsolete formats. The urgency of these issues increases with the age of the data. Indeed, FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) and Open data biodiversity data from prior to the mid-20th century or exceedingly rare.; further reason to preserve those data that do exist.  


This position forms part of the *NESKAST 1.0* project, with funding provided by the Netherlands Biodiversity Information Facility (NLBIF). In this project, we seek to apply best practices in data management to digitise and FAIRify historical (1922 - 1950) data on the breeding ecology of hole-nesting birds, which are currently stored as paper ledgers in the archives of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW). The data, spanning a nearly 30-year time period in the early professionalisation of ecology and biodiversity monitoring, were rigorously collected and stored by amateur naturalists. The data are especially valuable given their duration and coverage of a time period that is not well-represented by existing long-term studies.In particular, these data, in combination with those from the long-term nest box studies conducted by NIOO-KNAW and its predecessors since 1955, will extend our ability to understand how recent environmental change is impacting the ecology and population persistence of wild birds.  


In this short-term position, the prospective applicant will focus on three primary tasks:
* Digitisation of the historical nest box data — automated data extraction, manual data entry and cross-checking


* FAIRification of the data — generate metadata, apply standard data vocabularies, and map tabular data


* Prepare outreach materials — summarise project results for presentation to NESTKAST 2.0 community
  


**What will you be contributing?**
As part of a team working on data rescue and FAIRification, you will apply your knowledge and skills to digitise and archive the historical data described above. You will develop and implement a script for automated data extraction using script-based approaches in R (or other relevant languages), wrangling the extracted data into tidy, tabular data frames, and evaluating and correcting errors in the compiled datasets. Subsequent work will include the extraction of relevant metadata from the legders, creation of a data dictionary, and application of common data standards to ensure the data meeting FAIR practices. This work will be carried out in close collaboration with team members well-versed in these standards and their application to ecological data, and researchers actively collecting similar data from our long-term studies. You will be involved in preparing a summary presentation on the outcomes of this initiative.  


**Desired qualifications, skills and competences:**
* Basic experience with script-based data wrangling, standarisation, and visualisation, with a preference for the R programming language
* Experience with or knowledge of automated processes for extraction of tabular data from PDF scans of hand-written documents
* Experience with data validation, including assertative programming techniques
* Basic knowledge of or strong interest in data standards and metadata schema relevant in ecology and related disciplines (e.g., DarwinCore, Ecological Metadata Language)
* Strong interest in Open and FAIR research practices, and transparent and reproducible science
* Profiency in English, both written and verbal

  


**What are we offering?**
This technical/research support position will be hosted in the Department of Animal Ecology at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW) in Wageningen. The work will be carried out in collaboration with research personnel in the Department spearheading efforts in data rescue and FAIRification, and will link closely with the LTER-LIFE large-scale infrastructure project hosted at the Institute. The employee will work in a vibrant research group and have the opportunity to create strong links with collaborators and partners involved in national Open and FAIR Science initiatives.

**De afdeling -** ***Directie Grote Ondernemingen***  

De Directie Grote Ondernemingen (GO) is verantwoordelijk voor de fiscale behandeling van de ongeveer 9.000 grootste ondernemingen en non-profit organisaties in Nederland. Daarnaast behandelt GO een aantal dossiers van zeer vermogende personen en voeren we een aantal zeer uiteenlopende specialistische taken uit zoals de kansspelbelasting en constructiebestrijding. Onze klanten vertegenwoordigen zo’n 75% van de belastinginkomsten van de rijksoverheid. Ook genereren zij veel informatie die de overheid gebruikt voor bijvoorbeeld toeslagen of studiefinanciering.


De uitvoerings- en toezichtstrategie van GO is gericht op bereidwillige naleving van wet- en regelgeving door deze organisaties. Zij kenmerken zich door relatief grote financiële belangen en complexere fiscale vraagstukken. In het geval van multinationals komt daar nog een component bij in de vorm van internationale wet- en regelgeving en samenwerking met buitenlandse belastingdiensten.


Om er voor te zorgen dat de belastingafdracht van deze organisaties soepel blijft lopen werkt GO met behandelteams. In deze teams wordt kennis over de specifieke branche, de individuele ondernemingen en kennis van de verschillende belastingmiddelen samengebracht.


Zo werkt GO aan een zo efficiënt en effectief mogelijk proces voor het heffen, controleren en innen van de belastingen bij de grootste ondernemingen en non profit organisaties en zo dragen we bij aan een financieel gezond Nederland.

* Datamodel is in ontwikkeling om relaties tussen datasets inzichtelijk te maken, bronnen en vertrouwelijkheid vast te leggen.

Dunea heeft ambitie om korte en lange termijn natuurprocessen meer datagedreven te maken. Daarvoor is een quick scan uitgevoerd naar de huidige situatie en verbeterpotentieel in kaart gebracht. Vervolg dit jaar is nu:

* Benutten data: Er zijn twee prioriteiten (2 dashboards) bepaald om op korte termijn (2024) mee aan de slag te gaan. Daarna zullen volgende projecten voor digitalisering bepaald worden.
* Implementeren datamgt: Tegelijk/daarmee moet ook de datamanagement voor (het gerelateerde deel van) Natuurdata structureel geïmplementeerd worden.


Voor dit vervolg zoeken we een pragmatische projectleider (0.5 FTE), die helpt:

* Project te structureren en voortgang aanjaagt en bewaakt.
* Dunea Datamanagement te vertalen naar Natuur context.
* Verschillende betrokkenen coacht (data eigenaren, data stewards, data adviseur/architect, data gebruikers) in hun rol.
* Als nodig ondersteunt/spart bij data analyses of ontwikkelen dashboard.

**Faculteit/Dienst:** Faculteit der Maatschappij- & Gedragswetenschappen
**Opleidingsniveau:** Master
**Functie type:** Promotieplaats
**Sluitingsdatum:** 23 September 2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13280
*Are you passionate about advancing our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying social media's impact on youth?*
*Is it your ambition to be a part of an international team of researchers?**Are you enthusiastic about multi-method approaches that combine computational modeling, experience sampling, social media data donation and questionnaires with intervention-, experimental- and neuroimaging- studies?*  

*We would like to get to know you!*  

*The Connected Minds Lab* *at the department of Developmental Psychology is looking two PhD Candidates who are interested in joining our team.*  


**What are you going to do**  

The PhD canidates will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.
The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and two Postdocs, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).  

**What are you going to do**  


As a part of this team consisting of national and international researchers, and societal partners, you will play a central role in one of the work packages of this project. You will work on a wide array of research tasks, that include designing and performing empirical studies, and co-supervising RA’s working on the project.
Your tasks as a PhD within this ERC Consolidator project will include the following:
* Recruiting teens, students, parents for your studies;
* Draft pre-registrations and submit ethics reviews.
* Conduct data-analysis and prepare results for publications;
* Draft articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals;
* Contribute to the Connected Minds Lab and the wider scientific community through collaborations, workshops, presentations/talks, attending conferences.

  


**What do you have to offer**  


We are looking for a dedicated candidate who is eager to conduct basic/fundamental research on the psychological mechanisms underlying social media engagement and who is excited about making societal contributions. The candidate must thrive in a collaborative environment that calls for autonomy, creativity, and commitment. Given the quantitative focus of the projects an affinity with computational modeling and programming is recommended.  

***Your experience and profile***
* You hold a master’s degree in psychology, pedagogics, sociology, educational science, or an associated field. If you completed your master’s degree in the Netherlands, we have a preference for a research master, although this is not a requirement;
* You have strong interest in quantitative research;
* You are motivated to design and conduct your own quantitative research;
* You have excellent quantitative data-analysis skills or you are interested in acquiring these skills;
* Affinity with Open Science (pre-registrations, sharing data etc.);
* Experience with R or Python
* You have excellent writing and presentation skills in English;
* You enjoy working in a team of ambitious researchers.

  

  

Because the project involves intensive data collection with youth, sometimes at schools, mastering the Dutch language is an advantage. Please note that this is **not** a requirement, because excellent candidates who do not speak Dutch may be able to collect data with the assistance of Dutch-speaking students.  

**What can we offer you**  


* A position in which initiative and input are highly valued;
* An enthusiastic and warm team that is open to new colleagues;
* An inspiring academic and international working environment, in the heart of Amsterdam.

  


The position concerns employment of 38 hours per week for 4 years (or 30,4 hours for approximately 5 years). The initial employment is for one year. Following a positive assessment and barring altered circumstances this term will be extended, which should result in the conferral of a doctorate. Together with you, your supervisors will put together a curriculum that will also include the opportunity to attend training courses and both national and international events. You will also have the opportunity to teach bachelor’s and master’s students.  

Your salary will be €2.770 gross per month in the first year and will increase to €3.539 in the final year, based on full-time employment (38 hours per week) and in keeping with the Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities. We additionally offer an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%  


The UvA offers excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.  


**About us**  

The University of Amsterdam is the largest university in the Netherlands, with the broadest spectrum of degree programmes. It is an intellectual hub with 39,000 students, 6,000 employees and 3,000 doctoral students who are all committed to a culture of inquiring minds.  

***About the faculty***
A challenging work environment with a variety of duties and ample scope for individual initiative and development within an inspiring organization. The social and behavioral sciences play a leading role in addressing the major societal challenges faced by the world, the Netherlands and Amsterdam, now and in the future.

Daarna spar je met je directe collega over een analyse waar zij aan werkt. Vervolgens controleer je een syntax van een collega uit een ander team.

Voordat je naar huis gaat beoordeel je voor een andere collega of de methode en resultaten van een nieuw rapport goed zijn beschreven. Zie jij dit helemaal voor je? Twijfel niet en solliciteer bij ons!

**Hoeveel impact wil jij maken?**

Werken bij het Trimbos-instituut betekent impactvol werk doen met meerwaarde voor de maatschappij. Binnen het Trimbos-instituut werken we hard aan een mentaal gezonder Nederland. Het programma EpiDEM (Epidemiologie, Data, Evaluatie & Monitoring) levert hiervoor de basis door onderzoek te doen naar trends en ontwikkelingen in mentale gezondheid en middelengebruik van Nederlandse jongeren en volwassenen. We hebben een brede expertise op het gebied van monitoring-onderzoek, (economische) evaluaties en methoden en technieken van onderzoek. Het team wordt instituut-breed gevraagd voor methodologisch advies en biedt ondersteuning bij dataverzameling en datamanagement. We schrijven artikelen over mentale gezondheid, adviseren de overheid en zijn zichtbaar in de media. We zijn trots op deze belangrijke bijdrage aan het Nederlandse beleid voor mentale gezondheid! Ons werk maakt een wezenlijk verschil in de samenleving.

**Waar kom je te werken?**

De cultuur binnen het Trimbos-instituut wordt ervaren als professioneel, informeel, open en warm. Medewerkers voelen vrijheid en regelruimte. Ideeën en eigen inbreng worden zeer gewaardeerd. Zo kan er meegedacht worden over verschillende onderwerpen binnen de organisatie.

Het team waarin je komt te werken is enthousiast en gezellig. Binnen ons programma werken zo’n 15 (wetenschappelijk) medewerkers. Eén ding hebben ze allemaal gemeen: de passie om blijvende impact te maken op mentale gezondheid en middelengebruik.

Binnen EpiDEM vorm je samen met onze Research Datamanager en een junior onderzoeksmedewerker Research Support. Dit team adviseert en ondersteunt alle collega’s binnen het Trimbos-instituut in onderzoeken rondom mentale gezondheid en middelen. We ondersteunen bij zowel kwalitatief als kwantitatief onderzoek, waarbij de nadruk op kwantitatieve onderzoeken ligt.

**Dit doe jij als Specialist Onderzoeksmethoden en Data-Analyse**

* Je bent expert, adviseur en aanspreekpunt voor het doen van wetenschappelijk onderzoek binnen het Trimbos-instituut. Van onderzoeksvraag tot een study design met de juiste methoden en analyses: je collega’s binnen het Trimbos-instituut kunnen voor advies bij jou terecht.
* Je voert -naast je adviesrol- ook zelf onderzoekswerkzaamheden uit voor verschillende projecten, met name kwantitatieve analyses.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van methodologische ontwikkelingen relevant voor het veld en past deze toe waar ze meerwaarde hebben.
* Je geeft regelmatig voorlichting en training aan collega’s over (kwantitatief) onderzoek en reproduceerbaar werken.

**Dit is jouw kracht**

Jij hebt brede kennis en ervaring in (kwantitatieve) onderzoeksmethoden en analyses, en ziet jezelf als een expert op dat terrein. Deze kennis en ervaring blijkt uit je opleiding en werkervaring. Je bent wetenschappelijk opgeleid met een achtergrond in de Epidemiologie, Gezondheidswetenschappen of een andere, vergelijkbare richting. Het is een pré als je gepromoveerd bent. Je hebt plezier in het hele proces van onderzoek, denk daarbij aan het formuleren van onderzoeksvragen, het uitdenken van geschikte methoden bij verschillende vraagstellingen, het uitvoeren van power analyses, steekproeftrekkingen en het uitvoeren van complexe en minder complexe statistische analyses. Je kunt goed werken met R, en bij voorkeur ook met SPSS en/of STATA. Ervaring met kwalitatieve analyses, implementatieonderzoek en/of participatief onderzoek (zoals co-creatie) is een pré. Je bent communicatief sterk en kan complexe methoden en analyses begrijpelijk uitleggen aan minder ervaren collega’s. Je kunt goed zelfstandig werken, maar ook in een team en stelt je laagdrempelig en klantgericht op naar de collega's. Tot slot is je beheersing van Nederlands en Engels in woord en schrift uitstekend.

**Wij bieden jou**

Een marktconform salaris tussen de €4.108,- en €5.335,- (inschaling afhankelijk van het aantal jaren relevante werkervaring) op basis van 36 uur (FWG-60 CAO GGZ).

Dit ga je doen
  
  

Door de energietransitie komt er meer werk dan ooit op ons af. We moeten meer en sneller bouwen (meer kabels, meer leidingen, meer stations), het uiterste uit ons net halen door het volledig te benutten en goed beheren, zodat we de kwaliteit van ons net hoog houden. De afdeling Portfoliomanagement draagt hieraan bij door op (middel)lange termijn vooruit te kijken en te anticiperen op interne en externe omgevingsontwikkelingen. Zo kunnen we de uitvoerbaarheid van ons projectenportfolio met onze omgeving borgen. En om vooruit te kijken? Daar hebben we jou als data analist voor nodig!
  
  

Wat je doet als data analist?
  
  

Binnen deze afdeling analyseer je samen met collega’s de impact van interne en externe ontwikkelingen op ons vermogen om het portfolio van uitvoeringsprojecten uit te voeren. Dit doe je de ene keer vanaf kantoor, en de andere keer vanuit huis. Je houdt je bezig met het creëren van rapportages en het bieden van inzicht in het portfolio: welke werkzaamheden staan gepland en voor wanneer, in welke voorbereidingsfase zit het werk en hoe is het werk verdeeld over de regio’s? Je haalt de data op bij andere afdelingen en zorgt hiermee voor (stuur)informatie en rapportages, zodat we de juiste maatregelen kunnen nemen en de uitvoering van ons portfolio ook in de toekomst is gegarandeerd. Onze keten is dynamisch en je zal in je functie veel schakelen met collega’s op zowel operationeel, tactisch en strategisch niveau binnen verschillende lagen in de organisatie. Geen dag is hetzelfde! Vraagstukken waar je mee aan de slag kunt zijn bijvoorbeeld: “Hoe richten we een bruikbaar dashboard in om input te leveren voor de werkverdeling naar aannemers” of “Met welke informatie kunnen we projectteams helpen met het verbeteren van de datakwaliteit van hun eigen projecten?”
  
  

Als data analist haal je je data op bij collega’s die bijvoorbeeld het data warehouse beheren. Als bepaalde data niet beschikbaar is kan je een aanvraag doen bij collega’s of zij de data kunnen ontsluiten. Ook houd je je bezig met het verkrijgen van overzicht in de dataprocessen en denk je mee over hoe je uniformiteit kan creëren voor je collega portfoliomanagers. Door het analyseren van data zorg jij voor inzichten in en voor de keten.
  
  

**Wat deze functie zo leuk maakt? Anne, data analist, vertelt:** “Ik houd enorm van puzzelen, en mijn taken als data analist zie ik eigenlijk ook als een grote puzzel. Nadat je de ingewikkelde context hebt samengebracht tot een concrete data-vraag, ga je op zoek naar de juiste data in de systemen én naar kennis vanuit vakexperts, om de data goed te kunnen interpreteren. Hier laat je vervolgens je analyse op los om zo de gewenste informatie naar voren te halen en een concrete bijdrage te leveren. Hier haal ik veel plezier en voldoening uit!”
  
  

Kortom; houd jij ervan om samen met een gedreven team te bouwen aan de ontwikkeling van een nieuwe afdeling binnen de organisatie? Dan is dit de ideale plek voor jou.
  
  

Jouw sterke punten
  
Worden we blij van
  
  

Je bent een zelfstarter met analytisch inzicht en bent cijfermatig goed onderlegd. Is er nog geen duidelijkheid/concreetheid, dan zorg jij ervoor dat, dat er komt! Want jij bent van nature meer dan gemiddeld nieuwsgierig en onderzoekend. Je weet van onderzoeken over te gaan naar acties en bent hierin proactief. Je werkt nauwkeurig en weet data naar informatie om te zetten. Jezelf vragen stellen zoals “interpreteer ik de data juist?” en “zijn de resultaten logisch in de context?” zijn voor jou vanzelfsprekend. Daarnaast kun je goed hoofd- en bijzaken van elkaar onderscheiden en kan je data om zetten naar informatie. Je bent in staat om zowel vanuit tactisch als strategisch niveau te denken en vanuit deze niveaus kan je naar de rapportages en dashboards(behoefte) kijken. Je begrijpt dat het opzetten van nieuwe manieren van werken met onvermijdelijke uitdagingen gepaard gaat. Je gaat hier veerkrachtig mee om, toont flexibiliteit en overwint obstakels met vastberadenheid en positieve energie. Je durft vragen te stellen en gaat zelf op onderzoek uit, zodat je weet waar je welke informatie kunt vinden. Tot slot beschik je over zelfreflectie en werk je resultaatgericht.
  
  

Wat jou verder onze nieuwe data analist maakt? Dat lees je hier:
  
  

Je hebt een opleiding op wo-niveau afgerond of hebt een hbo-opleiding afgerond en kan aantoonbaar conceptueel denken.
  
  

Je hebt minimaal 2 jaar relevante werkervaring. De ervaringen doen een beroep op onder andere je analytisch vermogen en abstract denkvermogen.
  
  

Je hebt ervaring in projecten waarbij data analyse of data verwerking een rol speelde.
  
  

Je leert snel en hebt het vermogen om je een nieuw softwarepakket snel eigen te maken.
  
  

Je durft vragen te stellen en gaat zelf op onderzoek uit, zodat je weet waar je welke informatie kunt vinden.
  
  

**Goed om te weten:** Bij Stedin hebben we genoeg te doen. Daarom is deze rol voor minimaal 32 uur beschikbaar. Nog meer uit je rol halen? Dat kan natuurlijk ook.
  
  

Een goed team
  
Daar hoor je bij
  
  

Meteen vanaf dag één maak je deel uit van de keten Zakelijk Project die grote elektriciteits- en gasprojecten uitvoert in voornamelijk West- en Midden-Nederland. Binnen de keten maak je deel uit van het team Portfoliomanagement. Dit team heeft onder andere als doel om een voorspelbaar en gelijkmatig werkaanbod voor alle betrokkenen in het proces te bewerkstellingen. We houden ons bezig met portfoliomanagement en Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP). Het is een nieuw team waaraan nog vorm wordt gegeven. Je directe collega’s zijn bijvoorbeeld supply planners, andere data analisten en portfoliomanagers.
  
  

**Wat het team zo leuk maakt? Anne vertelt:** “Omdat Portfoliomanagement Zakelijk Project nog niet zo lang bestaat ben je betrokken bij de opzet en ontwikkeling van het team. Zo weet je waarom dingen ingericht worden zoals ze zijn, en wie zich met welke taken bezighoudt. Alle collega’s in het team zijn aardig en enthousiast, en hoewel iedereen zijn/haar eigen taken heeft, helpen we elkaar wanneer dat nodig is. We spreken elkaar in ieder geval wekelijks, maar kunnen op ieder moment bij elkaar terecht met vragen of om even te sparren.”
  
  

We werken volgens ons Stedin@Work concept. Je werkt ongeveer de helft van de tijd op ons kantoor, de plek waar jij je collega’s ontmoet. Jouw standplaats wordt Blaak. Je werkt echter ook in andere regio’s (Delft, Utrecht, Heinenoord). De andere helft van de tijd werk je thuis. Wel zo flexibel. Natuurlijk zorgen wij ook voor de juiste voorzieningen voor je thuiswerkplek, zoals een bureaustoel, een bureau en/of een beeldscherm.
  
  

Mooie arbeidsvoorwaarden
  
Die wil je hebben
  
  

Dat je van ons je eigen telefoon (of een Bring Your Own Device vergoeding) en laptop krijgt, vinden we vanzelfsprekend. Wat mag je nog meer van Stedin als werkgever verwachten?
  
  

Alle financiële arbeidsvoorwaarden op een rij, weet je meteen waar je aan toe bent:
  
  

Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden horen erbij. Zo krijg je, afhankelijk van kennis en ervaring, maximaal een salaris van € 5.792,- gebaseerd op 40 uur per week, 24,5 vakantiedagen en bouw je prima pensioen op bij het ABP.
  
  

Bovenop je salaris ontvang je een persoonlijk budget van 24% (inclusief 8% vakantiegeld). Jij kiest wat je met het budget doet. Elke maand extra salaris? Of meer verlofdagen? In onze nieuwe Rekentool krijg je een alvast een voorproefje van hoe jouw persoonlijk budget eruit zou kunnen zien en hoe je het zou kunnen besteden.
  
  

Gezonde energie, die heb je nodig. Daarom krijg je van ons ook een Duurzaam Inzetbaarheid budget van €500 bruto per jaar (bijvoorbeeld voor je sportabonnement of je nieuwe voetbalshirt). En claim jij alvast een plek in het volgende Stedin Voetbaltoernooi?
  
  

Volgens ons Stedin@Work concept werk je 50% thuis en 50% op kantoor, wel zo flexibel. Wij zorgen voor jouw thuiswerkfaciliteiten, een thuiswerkvergoeding en reizen naar kantoor doe je met je OV vrij-abonnement waarmee je ook buiten werk onbeperkt kan reizen!
  
  

**Daar komt dit nog bovenop:**  

Werken bij Stedin betekent werken bij een Worldclass Workplace.. Een van de trotspunten van onze (en jouw toekomstige) collega’s? Werksfeer.
  
  

**Jouw ontwikkeling staat centraal:** events bezoeken met collega’s, meedoen aan kennissessies, trainingen en opleidingen volgen. Zo geven we jouw talent écht alle kans en haal jij het beste uit jezelf.
  
  

Goede koffie van Heilige Boontjes. In Rotterdam kun je jouw bakkie ook halen bij onze ‘gebarista’ (onze slechthorende barista).”

Je bepaalt zelf waaraan je het Persoonlijk Budget wilt besteden. Zo kun je het uit laten keren voor een maandelijks extraatje. Of je koopt extra verlofdagen.
  
  

Flexibele werktijden
  
  

Wil je zelf je werkweek indelen? Samen met je leidinggevende bepaal jij zo veel mogelijk je eigen werktijden. We werken 8 uur per dag. Afhankelijk van je werkzaamheden, heb je de mogelijkheid om, wanneer het kan, thuis te werken.

Recruitment fraud is a scheme in which fictitious job opportunities are offered to job seekers typically through online services, such as false websites, or through unsolicited emails claiming to be from the company. These emails may request recipients to provide personal information or to make payments as part of their illegitimate recruiting process. DXC does not make offers of employment via social media networks and DXC never asks for any money or payments from applicants at any point in the recruitment process, nor ask a job seeker to purchase IT or other equipment on our behalf.

**De functie**
--------------


Wij zoeken een ervaren technisch onderlegde Product Owner (PO) voor onze DevOps-teams. Deze teams bestaan uit een diverse mix van specialisten, waaronder data engineers, cloud engineers en security experts. Als PO ben jij de spil in deze teams en zorg je ervoor dat de juiste producten worden gebouwd en geleverd.



Want Amsterdam heeft betrouwbare data nodig over bijvoorbeeld bewoners, verkeer en milieu. Dagelijks worden er beslissingen genomen over de stad. Het Dataplatform ondersteunt deze beslissingen. Met het Dataplatform creëert de gemeente Amsterdam een gemeentelijk datafundament. De data zijn niet alleen vindbaar op één plek, maar zijn ook op een veilige manier toegankelijk voor gebruikers.



Als Technical Product Owner heb je een bewezen trackrecord in het werken in een Agile omgeving en kun je complexe technische vraagstukken vertalen naar heldere product backlogs. Je bent sterk in communicatie en kunt stakeholders op verschillende niveaus overtuigen van de waarde van jouw producten. Daarnaast ben je in staat om prioriteiten te stellen, om te gaan met veranderende eisen en om onder druk de juiste beslissingen te nemen. Denk aan gesprekken met bijvoorbeeld platformarchitecten, security/privacy professionals en dataengineers.



Onze Dataplatform-omgeving is dynamisch en vraagt om een proactieve en flexibele PO. Je werkt in een omgeving waar nieuwe technologieën snel worden geïntroduceerd en waar de data-eisen continu veranderen. Je bent in staat om in deze omgeving overzicht te houden, zonder de belangen van de stakeholders uit het oog te verliezen en je weet teams te motiveren om de gestelde doelen te bereiken. Je werkt hierin nauw samen met de Scrum Masters van de teams.

**Hoe ook jij het verschil maakt**
----------------------------------


Als Informatie Analist Efficient Backoffice ben je dé schakel tussen de business en de IT organisatie. Een zeer afwisselende baan waarin je letterlijk door het hele kantoor heen beweegt. Je hebt veel contacten met stakeholders in verschillende divisies. Zij komen regelmatig met vragen over nieuwe functionaliteiten of wensen op gebied van (door)ontwikkeling van de applicaties. Aan jou de taak om het wensenlijstje in kaart te brengen, de haalbaarheid in te schatten en uiteindelijk de vertaalslag te maken voor de leverancier van de applicaties.


Dit alles doe je niet alleen, maar in nauwe samenwerking met jouw teamgenoten, de Product Owner, onze leveranciers en andere stakeholders. Met jouw teamgenoten bepaal je of de ideeën vanuit de business interessant zijn om in productie te nemen, qua technische haalbaarheid en kosten. De Product Owner beheert de backlog en bepaalt daarmee of de changes daadwerkelijk zullen worden uitgevoerd.


Alles draait bij deze functie om data en hoe we die inzetten om tot zinnige zorg te komen. Om als digitale aanjager te boek te staan, zijn er nog genoeg uitdagingen om dit te realiseren. In de backoffice van VGZ worden de polis administratie, creditmanagement en declaratieservice geregeld voor onze klanten. Deze diensten moeten natuurlijk 24/7 bereikbaar zijn en goed werken. Het team Efficient Backoffice is verantwoordelijk voor de ontwikkeling, het onderhoud, het beheer en de optimalisatie van deze applicaties. Met ruim vier miljoen klanten en vele miljoenen declaraties per jaar is het werken in dit team uitdagend én veelzijdig. En levert het team een gigantische bijdrage aan de Zinnige Zorg strategie van Coöperatie VGZ.


**Samenwerken aan een gezonder Nederland. Wat betekent dat voor jou?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Wij hebben oog voor ontwikkeling. Ontwikkeling van de juiste zorgoplossingen en jouw persoonlijke groei. Samen kijken we wat er bij jou speelt en hoe we jou kunnen helpen. Op deze manier krijg jij ruimte om met jouw talent te werken aan projecten, binnen een omgeving waar expertise en innovatieve ideeën centraal staan.

*Daarnaast bieden we jou:*

* Een salaris tussen de € 4.081,- en € 5.829,- p/m o.b.v. 38 uur (Salarisschaal H van de CAO van VGZ);
* Een uitgebreide studieregeling gericht op ontwikkeling, loopbaan en verbreding van je inzetbaarheid;
* Een persoonlijk opleidingsbudget van € 500,- per jaar;
* Vakantiegeld (8%) en een dertiende maand (8,33%);
* Uitgebreide pensioenregeling bij SBZ Pensioen;
* Naast aantrekkelijke kortingen op verzekeringen, ontvang je een werkgeversbijdrage van €60,- bruto per maand;
* We werken hybride, wat betekent dat je het merendeel van de week werkt vanuit een – door ons gefaciliteerde – arbo-proof thuiswerkplek;
* Werk je thuis, dan ontvang je (op declaratiebasis) een netto working@home-toeslag;
* Je ontvangt maandelijks een netto vergoeding van € 40,- voor internet thuis.

**Dit is wat jij meebrengt**
----------------------------


Je vindt het leuk om complexe puzzels op te lossen. Je bent een verbinder en communiceert net zo makkelijk met de polis administratie als met een ontwikkelaar. Je kunt op goed niveau met jouw teamgenoten sparren over technische zaken, en bent ook in staat om een heldere uitleg te geven aan collega’s buiten Data Care die geen verstand hebben van de techniek. Kortom, jouw sociale vaardigheden zijn dusdanig ontwikkeld dat je je perfect aanpast aan je gesprekspartner.

*Bovendien staan de volgende zaken op jouw cv:*

* Een afgeronde Hbo-opleiding in de richting van Informatica of soortgelijk;
* Minimaal 5 jaar werkervaring als Informatieanalist of Functioneel ontwerper;
* Aantoonbare kennis van requirement-engineering, bijvoorbeeld in bezit van IREB-certificering;
* Kennis van en ervaring met Agile methodieken als Scrum en Kanban;
* Ervaring met het vertalen van business requirements naar een functioneel detailontwerp, met UML methodieken zoals use cases, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams;
* Ervaring in het werken met het softwarepakket Sparx Enterprise Architect is een pré;
* Kennis van PL/SQL en het gebruik van query’s is een pré.

**Hoe ook jij het verschil maakt**
----------------------------------


Data is niet meer weg te denken uit onze organisatie en we zijn goed onderweg om van VGZ een data gedreven organisatie te maken. Dat wil zeggen dat besluiten genomen worden op basis van data. Deze data moeten betrouwbaar én beschikbaar zijn. Ons nieuwe VGZ Data platform (VDP) speelt een cruciale rol in deze visie. Ons platform is een uitdagende omgeving waar wordt gewerkt met de nieuwste services binnen de Azure Cloud, zoals Databricks.


Als Data Engineer binnen de afdeling Zorg kom je te werken in een team van vijf enthousiaste Data Engineers. Het VGZ Data Platform (VDP) Value Team werkt nauw samen met het Data Science Zorg. Het VDP Value Team is een DevOps team waarbij dataproducten ontwikkeld en beheerd worden. Als Data Engineer is het je passie om data op een efficiënte manier te ontsluiten voor analytische toepassingen en help je om bestaande processen te optimaliseren en nieuwe processen mogelijk te maken. Iemand die gevraagd en ongevraagd de kwaliteit en betrouwbaarheid van de beschikbaar gestelde data naar een hoger niveau brengt. Je snapt wat er nodig is, zonder het te complex te maken. Jouw werk en jouw dataproducten hebben impact in onze organisatie en hierdoor ben je de enabler van het data gedreven werken.


Je werkt meer dan ooit samen met de specialist intelligence en de data scientist. Immers, data science en machine learning modellen leveren pas waarde als ze in productie staan, dashboards enkel als de informatie actueel en relevant is. Je doet dit alles binnen het Azure Ecosysteem en gaat aan de slag met services als Databricks en Power BI.


**Samenwerken aan een gezonder Nederland. Wat betekent dat voor jou?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Wij hebben oog voor ontwikkeling. Ontwikkeling van de juiste zorgoplossingen en jouw persoonlijke groei. Samen focussen we op datgene wat je wilt bereiken. Op deze manier krijg jij ruimte om jouw unieke talent in te zetten voor een belangrijk maatschappelijk doel. We luisteren naar elkaar, werken samen en bundelen onze krachten om Nederland gezonder te maken.

**Dit is wat jij meebrengt**
----------------------------


Waar wij voor staan? Daar kun jij je in vinden. Naast de kennis van ETL, snap je data verwerkende processen en draag je bij aan continue verbetering van proces, team en product. De functie kent bijvoorbeeld ook een ‘informatie analist component’ waarbij je gevraagd en ongevraagd kansen en wensen vertaalt naar relevante, functionele BI-oplossingen die passen binnen de geldende architectuurkaders. De aanpak en impact werk je uit samen met het scrumteam en de product owner. Dat alles doe je met kennis van wet- en regelgeving en oog voor de volwassenheid van datamanagement.


Naast het op peil houden van je kennis deel je deze ook graag met je collega’s en sta je open voor kennis van anderen. Het team werkt zelforganiserend, dat vergt een grote mate van samenwerking en verantwoordelijkheid enerzijds, en geeft een hoge mate van vrijheid anderzijds.


Agile/DevOps werken kost jou geen enkele moeite en je ziet werken met de diverse moderne tools, cloud oplossingen en -technieken als een uitdaging;

*Bovendien staan de volgende zaken op jouw cv:*

* Een afgeronde opleiding op HBO- of WO-niveau in een technische richting als Informatica, Wiskunde, Computer Science of vergelijkbaar;

Dit is beleggingsinformatie maar ook pensioendata van onze deelnemers. Als Data Engineer hou je je bezig met het ontsluiten, modelleren en beschikbaar stellen van data. Je schakelt hiervoor veel met de interne afdelingen die dat nodig hebben. In deze functie, voeg je kennis en ervaring toe aan het groeiende team en ben je van essentieel belang om de stap met MN te maken naar het verkrijgen van inzicht op basis van data.


**Jouw rol**
------------


Je bent een gedreven Data Engineer die uitdagingen niet uit de weg gaat. Je ontwikkelt jezelf in een hoog tempo en draagt oplossingen en ideeën op een doordachte manier aan. We werken voornamelijk met tooling zoals Snowflake en Matillion. Het programmeren in Python mag hier zeker niet bij ontbreken. Dit alles doen we op een AWS omgeving. Als Data Engineer ben je verantwoordelijk voor het ontwerp van nieuwe producten en features in ons data platform. Je werkt hiervoor nauw samen met de collega Data Engineers en voorziet deze van input en feedback. In deze rol is het belangrijk dat je heel zelfstandig je weg weet te vinden en zelfstandig aan het werk kan. Het doel van MN is om de data gecentraliseerd op te slaan en snel te komen tot inzichten op basis van de data. Hier werken we aan binnen verschillende teams. Binnen dit team wordt er gewerkt aan het realiseren van het inzicht door het ontsluiten van zoveel mogelijk data en dit op een geordende en gestructureerde manier terug te geven aan de organisatie. Binnen het team werk je, voorlopig, met name samen met externe collega's. Op termijn wordt het team verder vormgegeven door interne collega's.


Samen met je collega’s ben je de drijfveer om van het data platform iets moois te maken waar MN jaren mee vooruit kan. Je hebt een pro-actieve en vooral positieve mindset waarbij je denkt in oplossingen en uitdagingen. Creativiteit en efficiency zijn een belangrijke mix in jouw werk. Je bouwt tenslotte aan een dataplatform wat wordt opgebouwd om snel te kunnen voorzien in de vragen van de interne afdelingen.


Jouw rol houdt verder in:


* Verantwoordelijk voor het bouwen van het platform gedurende de hele levenscyclus, bijv. het bouwen van datapijplijnen en het modelleren van opslag- en datagebruiksfunctionaliteit;
* Verantwoordelijk voor het oplossen van datagestuurde functionele verzoeken door middel van analyse en oplossingsontwerp;
* Eigenaarschap op het applicatielandschap wat gebruikt wordt door het team;
* Sparringspartner voor data vraagstukken;
* Kennishouder van wat er in het dataplatform zit, is opgebouwd en gebruikt kan worden.


**Jouw profiel**
----------------


Wij zijn op zoek naar een Data Engineer die door zijn of haar ervaring en kunde een sterke meerwaarde kan leveren voor het team van engineers. Jij hebt niet alleen de technische achtergrond maar hebt ook een bewezen trackrecord in het opbouwen van een datawarehouse. Daarnaast heb je een positieve mindset en ben je een echte teamplayer.


**Wat je ook meebrengt:**


* 1-3 jaar bewezen praktijkervaring in Data Engineering, waarbij ontwerp en creativiteit een sleutelrol hebben gespeeld bij het vinden van robuuste oplossingen;
* Master informatica, wiskunde, natuurkunde, economie enz. Verdient de voorkeur;
* Sterk in het Nederlands en bij voorkeur ook in het Engels;
* Ervaren in het werken met AWS, Python, SQL, Snowflake en Matillion verdient de voorkeur;
* Ervaring met programmeren met Python, ontwikkeling van microservices (REST API's);
* Bekend met DevOps;
* Ervaring in een agile werkomgeving.


**Jouw werkomgeving**
---------------------


Het datateam maakt deel uit van de unit IT en dan het aandachtsgebied Data. Samen met jou richten we een nieuw team op van sterke professionals. Naast dit nieuwe team bestaan er al andere teams welke zich bezighouden met data centricity, data analytics en data management.


**MN als werkgever**
--------------------


Wij zijn dé fiduciair vermogensbeheerder voor Nederlandse pensioenfondsen. We voeren integraal vermogensbeheer uit met een belegd vermogen van circa €150 miljard. Dat doen we voor zeven Nederlandse pensioenfondsen en hun achterban van 2 miljoen deelnemers en circa 35.000 werkgevers. Complex, dynamisch en maatschappelijk uiterst relevant: dat is het speelveld waarin we met onze 500 collega’s dagelijks opereren.


MN is een organisatie zonder winstoogmerk en daarmee wijken we af van de meeste andere aanbieders van fiduciair vermogensbeheer. Bij MN geloven we in de kracht van verschillende perspectieven en bijdragen van mensen met verschillende achtergronden. Wij geloven in de opbrengst van ‘diversiteit in denken’. Iedereen moet zich thuis kunnen voelen bij MN. Je mag bij ons rekenen op een moderne werkomgeving met een prachtig uitzicht op de Haagse skyline, optimale (thuis)werkfaciliteiten, royale ontwikkelkansen en aantrekkelijke extra’s zoals een inpandige sportschool en een bedrijfsrestaurant met steeds een gevarieerd en eigentijds aanbod


**Als MN'er mag je rekenen op**
-------------------------------

* Een marktconform salaris (afhankelijk van je ervaring), eindejaarsuitkering en vakantiegeld;
* Reiskostenvergoeding, internetvergoeding en goede pensioenregeling;
* Werken bij MN is werken in een ambitieuze organisatie met maatschappelijke doelstellingen;
* De sfeer is open, laagdrempelig en collegiaal;
* MN biedt alle faciliteiten die een grote organisatie heeft maar blijft wel wendbaar en flexibel.

Toen je voor het eerst het gebouw van Malvern Panalytical betrad, werd je overweldigd door nieuwsgierigheid. Je had namelijk geen idee van de verbazingwekkende complexiteit die schuilging achter de muren. Want wie had kunnen vermoeden dat de geavanceerde systemen die hier worden ontwikkeld en vervaardigd, een cruciale rol spelen bij het optimaliseren van gewasgroei op Afrikaanse velden? Boeren die hun oogsten tot bloei laten komen met behulp van onze technologie, het was een verrassend inzicht.
Je was net zo verbaasd toen je hoorde over onze bijdrage aan de voedselkwaliteitscontrole. Onze systemen die schadelijke stoffen in voedsel kunnen opsporen, en zo bijdragen aan wereldwijde voedselveiligheid.
Maar het hoogtepunt was toen je hoorde over onze betrokkenheid bij de ontwikkeling van steeds duurzamere materialen. Onze systemen, die worden gebruikt bij onderzoek en fabricage processen bij klanten, analyseren monsters om te onderzoeken of materialen (nog) duurzamer gemaakt kunnen worden. Het idee dat onze technologie letterlijk bijdraagt aan een betere wereld is ronduit fascinerend en motiverend.
En jij, als machine tester, speelt een cruciale rol in ons proces. Door onze systemen te verfijnen en te testen ben jij degene die bepaald wanneer ze worden vrijgegeven en klaar zijn om te verschepen naar onze klanten. Het maakt je trots dat jouw werk cruciaal is in de weg naar innovatie, ontdekking en verbetering.
We zullen ons eerst voorstellen:  

Malvern Panalytical is een toonaangevende ontwikkelaar en leverancier van analytische röntgeninstrumentatie. We richten ons op het ontwikkelen en leveren van geavanceerde technologieën en instrumenten die wetenschappers, ingenieurs en onderzoekers helpen om een dieper inzicht te krijgen in de eigenschappen van materialen. Dit doen we voor diverse industrieën, waaronder chemie, farmaceutica, voedsel, mijnbouw, energie en meer.
Wie zoeken wij?  

We zijn op zoek naar enthousiaste en technisch vaardige collega’s die een passie hebben voor precisie en die willen werken aan state-of-the-art apparatuur in een uitdagende, hightech productieomgeving.
Als machine tester:  

Is het jouw taak om machines na de voormontage af te bouwen tot ze helemaal voldoen aan de eisen van de klant. Je voert daarbij ook een aantal testen uit om te bepalen of de machine naar behoren functioneert. Deze mechanische en functionele testen voer je zelfstandig uit.
Maar jouw rol rijkt verder dan alleen assemblage en testen. Wanneer er onregelmatigheden optreden ben jij degene die deze moet interpreteren en oplossen, of het nu gaat om elektronische problemen of mechanische gebreken. Jij bent uiteindelijk degene die bepaald of het systeem vrijgegeven mag worden voor verzending naar onze klanten.
Wat vragen we van jou?
	+ Ervaring in het werken in een technische- of productieomgeving
	+ Een opleiding bij voorkeur in de richting elektronica, mechatronica, fijnmechanica of autotechniek
	+ Basiskennis van de Engelse taal
	+ Een proactieve instelling en een analytische blik
	+ Je kunt gedisciplineerd en zeer nauwgezet werken
	+ Je werkt net zo makkelijk zelfstandig als in teamverband
Met wie en voor wie werk je?  

Onze afdeling productie in Almelo bestaat uit verschillende onderdelen, het proces begint bij assemblage en eindigt bij de test afdeling. In totaal werken er 130 collega’s bij de productie (waarvan 35 bij de testafdeling). De groep Machine Testers zijn verdeeld over 2 systemen namelijk de XRD en XRF.
Dit krijg je van ons:  

Een veelzijdige, uitdagende en boeiende functie binnen een hightech organisatie en waar veel nadruk ligt op persoonlijke ontwikkeling en groei. Het salaris bedraagt tussen €2.700 euro bruto en €3.385 euro bruto per maand op basis van een fulltime dienstverband, daarbij krijg je 8% vakantietoeslag en 8,33% eindejaarsuitkering. We kennen daarnaast 27 vakantiedagen en 13 roostervrije dagen. We hebben een goede pensioenregeling belegd bij PME.
Waarom kiezen voor Malvern Panalytical?
	+ Je wordt onderdeel van een groeiend, internationaal hightech bedrijf
	+ Je mag werken aan state-of-the-art systemen
	+ Onze technologieën worden gebruikt om een betere wereld te creëren
	+ Je vindt onze systemen in de meest uiteenlopende gebieden. Van de mijnbouw in de outback van Australië tot aan bodemonderzoek op de Zuidpool.

**De afdeling -** ***Corporate Dienst Datafundamenten en Analytics***  

De Corporate Dienst Datafundamenten en Analytics (DF&A) werkt voor directies van de Belastingdienst die belast zijn met de fiscale behandeling van burgers en bedrijven én voor bedrijfsvoering. DF&A levert signaalmodellen en informatiedashboards die zijn gebaseerd op de analyse van ‘big data’ en die de organisatie inzicht geven in de mogelijkheden om werkzaamheden slimmer en beter uit te voeren. Zo kunnen op informatie-gestuurde wijze keuzes worden gemaakt in bijvoorbeeld handhavingsstrategieën, behandeladviezen en procesinrichtingen.  

De signaalmodellen en dashboards worden gebouwd door gebruik te maken van innovatieve IT-ontwikkelingen en het koppelen van zeer divers aangeleverde data. DF&A maakt hiervoor gebruik van een zelfontwikkelde methodiek om data op te bouwen tot datafundamenten, die de basis zijn voor de producten.

De aanwezigheid van ervaren collega’s stimuleert jouw ontwikkeling, net als de complexiteit en uitdagingen tijdens opdrachten. Dagelijks sta je voor complexe puzzels en geniet je van de variatie en uitdaging die de opdrachten bieden, waardoor je voortdurend wordt uitgedaagd en gemotiveerd.

In de basis vraag je bij de klant de behoefte naar managementinformatie uit en vertaal je deze naar een rapport of dashboard. Als BI Consultant richt je je op het ontwikkelen van het rapport of dashboard met de beschikbare BI-tool, terwijl je als Data Engineer meer bezig bent met de techniek achter het beschikbaar stellen van de data (en meestal) in de vorm van een datawarehouse.

**Jouw verantwoordelijkheden**

* Je analyseert de informatiebehoefte en data;
* Je ontwikkelt rapporten en dashboards;
* Je ontwikkelt een datawarehouse en bijbehorende ETL-processen;

Jouw bijdrage gaat verder dan waarde leveren aan klanten; het draagt direct bij aan positieve maatschappelijke impact.

Zo kan je naast goed samenwerken met professionals, ook op vrijwillige basis aansluiten bij leuke uitjes die georganiseerd worden door onze personeelsvereniging.

Jouw communicatieve vaardigheden en resultaatgerichtheid zorgen er daarnaast voor je dat je nieuwe concepten snel kunt oppakken, goed met stakeholders kan schakelen en flexibel bent in veranderende omstandigheden.

**Wat je verder meeneemt:**

**Hoe ook jij het verschil maakt**
----------------------------------


Data is niet meer weg te denken uit onze organisatie en we zijn goed onderweg om van VGZ een data gedreven organisatie te maken. Dat wil zeggen dat besluiten genomen worden op basis van data. Deze data moeten betrouwbaar én beschikbaar zijn. Ons nieuwe VGZ Data platform (VDP) speelt een cruciale rol in deze visie. Ons platform is een uitdagende omgeving waar wordt gewerkt met de nieuwste services binnen de Azure Cloud, zoals Databricks.


Als Data Engineer binnen de afdeling Zorg kom je te werken in een team van vijf enthousiaste Data Engineers. Het VGZ Data Platform (VDP) Value Team werkt nauw samen met het Data Science Zorg. Het VDP Value Team is een DevOps team waarbij dataproducten ontwikkeld en beheerd worden. Als Data Engineer is het je passie om data op een efficiënte manier te ontsluiten voor analytische toepassingen en help je om bestaande processen te optimaliseren en nieuwe processen mogelijk te maken. Iemand die gevraagd en ongevraagd de kwaliteit en betrouwbaarheid van de beschikbaar gestelde data naar een hoger niveau brengt. Je snapt wat er nodig is, zonder het te complex te maken. Jouw werk en jouw dataproducten hebben impact in onze organisatie en hierdoor ben je de enabler van het data gedreven werken.


Je werkt meer dan ooit samen met de specialist intelligence en de data scientist. Immers, data science en machine learning modellen leveren pas waarde als ze in productie staan, dashboards enkel als de informatie actueel en relevant is. Je doet dit alles binnen het Azure Ecosysteem en gaat aan de slag met services als Databricks en Power BI.


**Samenwerken aan een gezonder Nederland. Wat betekent dat voor jou?**
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Wij hebben oog voor ontwikkeling. Ontwikkeling van de juiste zorgoplossingen en jouw persoonlijke groei. Samen focussen we op datgene wat je wilt bereiken. Op deze manier krijg jij ruimte om jouw unieke talent in te zetten voor een belangrijk maatschappelijk doel. We luisteren naar elkaar, werken samen en bundelen onze krachten om Nederland gezonder te maken.

*Daarnaast bieden wij jou:*

* Een salaris tussen de € 3.488,- en € 4.982,- per maand o.b.v. 38 uur (Salarisschaal G van de CAO van VGZ);
* Een uitgebreide studieregeling gericht op ontwikkeling, loopbaan en verbreding van je inzetbaarheid;
* Een persoonlijk opleidingsbudget van € 500,- per jaar;
* Vakantiegeld (8%) en een dertiende maand (8,33%);
* Uitgebreide pensioenregeling bij SBZ Pensioen;
* Naast aantrekkelijke kortingen op verzekeringen, ontvang je een werkgeversbijdrage van €60,- bruto per maand;
* We werken hybride, wat betekent dat je het merendeel van de week werkt vanuit een – door ons gefaciliteerde – arbo-proof thuiswerkplek;
* Werk je thuis, dan ontvang je (op declaratiebasis) een netto working@home-toeslag;
* Je ontvangt maandelijks een netto vergoeding van €40,- voor internet thuis.


**Dit is wat jij meebrengt**
----------------------------


Waar wij voor staan? Daar kun jij je in vinden. Naast de kennis van ETL, snap je data verwerkende processen en draag je bij aan continue verbetering van proces, team en product. De functie kent bijvoorbeeld ook een ‘informatie analist component’ waarbij je gevraagd en ongevraagd kansen en wensen vertaalt naar relevante, functionele BI-oplossingen die passen binnen de geldende architectuurkaders. De aanpak en impact werk je uit samen met het scrumteam en de product owner. Dat alles doe je met kennis van wet- en regelgeving en oog voor de volwassenheid van datamanagement.


Naast het op peil houden van je kennis deel je deze ook graag met je collega’s en sta je open voor kennis van anderen. Het team werkt zelforganiserend, dat vergt een grote mate van samenwerking en verantwoordelijkheid enerzijds, en geeft een hoge mate van vrijheid anderzijds.


Agile/DevOps werken kost jou geen enkele moeite en je ziet werken met de diverse moderne tools, cloud oplossingen en -technieken als een uitdaging;

*Bovendien staan de volgende zaken op jouw cv:*

* Een afgeronde opleiding op HBO- of WO-niveau in een technische richting als Informatica, Wiskunde, Computer Science of vergelijkbaar;
* Een stevige basis in SQL;
* Kennis van Azure Data platform services;
* Kennis van Databricks en Python;
* Kennis van Azure DevOps en GIT;”
* Aantoonbare kennis van data extractie en transformatie tools;
* Kennis van datamart ontwerp en stermodellen;
* Ervaring met Power BI is een pré;

Certificeringen zoals Azure Data Engineer Associate of Azure Solutions Architect zijn een pré.  
* 

  

We werken tegelijkertijd aan het vergroten van de diversiteit van ons medewerkersbestand én het vergroten van onze inclusieve werkcultuur waarin je betrokken, gewaardeerd en gezien wordt.


**Coöperatie VGZ. Voorop in gezondheid en zorg. Voor iedereen.**
----------------------------------------------------------------


Als Coöperatief VGZ werken we samen aan een gezonder Nederland en toekomstbestendige zorg voor iedereen. Onze bedrijfswaarden Menselijk, Vindingrijk, Gedreven en Betrouwbaar helpen ons dit waar te maken.

-------------------


  
Wil jij de Rijksoverheid helpen met het doen van data science onderzoeken op het gebied van HR? Vind je het leuk om bij verschillende Rijksorganisaties over de vloer te komen om inzicht op basis van data analyses te geven en beleid te verbeteren? Dan zijn we bij het Analytics Lab (aLab) op zoek naar jou! Wij zoeken een ervaren data scientist met ervaring in data en tekstanalyses, en interesse voor HR.  

  

Bij het aLab van O&P Rijk heb je de mogelijkheid om data onderzoek uit te voeren in opdracht van organisaties binnen het Rijk. Hierbij zet jij jouw data science kennis en ervaring in om inzicht te geven over de medewerkers van de desbetreffende organisatie. Denk hierbij aan onderzoeken over verzuim, bewegingen binnen de organisatie, maar ook hoe inclusief vacatureteksten geschreven zijn.



Tijdens de projecten bezoek je verschillende Rijksorganisaties om samen met de opdrachtgever het onderzoek uit te voeren. Zo probeer jij vanuit je data expertise en de opdrachtgever met de organisatiekennis, de data en inzichten te doorgronden om samen met de opdrachtgever tot antwoorden op de businessvragen te komen. Iedere opdracht is anders; je levert altijd maatwerk, stelt de juiste vragen en weet die vragen te vertalen naar onderzoek en antwoorden.  

  

Als data scientist binnen het team help je daarnaast mee aan het ontwikkelen van het data gedreven werken binnen het HR-domein van het Rijk. Zo vertel je graag aan andere HR-analytics geïnteresseerden binnen het Rijk, over de onderzoeken die je doet en ga je met hen in gesprek om hun organisatie te ontwikkelen op dit gebied. Ook organiseer je samen met het team een paar keer per jaar HR-analytics community bijeenkomsten, waarbij je HR-experts binnen het Rijk samenbrengt om kennis te delen over het gebruik van data science op HR-gebied.  

  

Verder sta je er voor open om projecten uit te voeren om de dienstverlening van de organisatie te verbeteren met behulp van jouw data science expertise. Zo hebben we eerder onderzoek gedaan naar het ontwikkelen van nieuwe Frequently Asked Questions op basis van gebruikersdata met behulp van tekst analyse. Daarnaast blijven we op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen in data science. Zo verkennen we momenteel de ontwikkeling en het gebruik van een synthetische dataset.  

  

In het team communiceren we op een open manier en geven elkaar regelmatig constructieve feedback. Zo zorgen we voor de ontwikkeling van jou en de rest van het team. Een voorbeeld hiervan is het controleren van elkaars code. Ook bespreken we maandelijks in teamverband hoe het werk loopt en of hier verbeteringen mogelijk zijn.  

  

In ons team vinden we verschillen belangrijk. Iedereen werkt op zijn of haar eigen manier en hier is ook ruimte voor. Wil jij even sporten in je lunchpauze of ‘s middags je (klein)kind van school halen en ‘s avonds je werk afmaken? Dit is zeker mogelijk, omdat we hybride werken. We hanteren flexibele werktijden, maar starten de dag altijd samen. Online of op kantoor.

The Institute of Environmental Sciences CML and Faculty of Science is looking for:

 **Postdoctoral Researcher on Actor-level Global Food System Footprinting**  

**Vacancy number: 15045**


**Overview**  

We are seeking a highly motivated researcher to join our team as a Postdoctoral Researcher at Leiden University's CML Institute of Environmental Sciences, to work in the nascent field of actor-level global environmental footprinting. The postholder will help to develop a new global model to study the different roles consumers, farmers and companies play in food system sustainability transitions.


Global food system models lack detail of food system actors and their uneven influence on environmental risks. Microdata on food consumers, producers, and companies offers tremendous potential to pinpoint high-impact actors and distinguish their roles in sustainable food futures. Yet, enriching global food system models with actor-level data remains hindered by technical demands of linking disparate, unaligned, and conflicting information, using methods from macroeconomic, environmental, and nutritional modelling. This project will develop and implement innovative methods to couple food system actor data with macroeconomic models, to assess the socio-environmental impacts of food system transitions from a multi-actor perspective, in individual countries and globally.

**Key tasks:**  

You will work in an interdisciplinary setting to integrate models and data from different fields (e.g. food sciences, economics, environmental science, epidemiology). Specifically, you will:

* Further extend an integrated food system model with microdata on consumer diets, farmer practices and food company activities, to better attribute socio-environmental impacts of food systems to individual food system actors.
* Perform several detailed analyses on the environmental and social impacts of global food systems and food system transitions, from a multi-actor perspective.
* Disseminate scientific findings via high-impact scientific publications, international conferences, and policy exchanges.
* Within the project, you will work closely with Ass. Prof. Oliver Taherzadeh and others to develop the methods, data, and analytical frameworks to overcome the limited actor-level detail of global food system sustainability models. Dr. Taherzadeh is dedicated to creating an inclusive and open research environment which nurtures critical scholarship and mentoring of early career researchers from a diversity of backgrounds. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach to problem-driven research in which we help one other thrive. You will be based in Leiden, a vibrant city known for its rich scientific heritage. The role may involve international travel for research to present research findings and collaborate with leading experts in this field.

**Selection Criteria**  

The following criteria are essential:

* PhD degree in Industrial Ecology, Environmental Economics, Geography, or a related discipline, specialising in global environmental footprinting of food systems or national economies.
* Proven ability using industrial ecology methods, such as LCA, MFA, and (MR)IOA to assess the scale, drivers and socio-ecological impacts of global resource flows within the food system or wider economy.
* Expertise modelling the global impacts of food system transitions across multiple impacts (e.g. climate, biodiversity, deforestation, water, nutrition, food insecurity).
* Evidence of publications in respected scientific journals related to the topics above.
* Great interpersonal and communication skills, and excellent English language proficiency, with experience communicating scientific findings to a wide audience (e.g. policy makers, industry and the general public).


Any of these criteria are highly valued:

* Experience with one or more of the following methods: Geographic Information Systems (GIS), machine learning, network analysis, and econometrics
* Practice combining Industrial Ecology models and data to improve the accuracy and scope of environmental footprinting analysis
* Use of microdata related to food consumption (e.g. food intake surveys), production (e.g. farmer surveys) and trade activities (e.g. company-level data).
* An interdisciplinary knowledge of the societal and policy levers related to environmental and/or food system challenges
* Interest and experience in teaching related to environmental change and food system sustainability.


We are committed to building an inclusive and diverse team, welcoming applications from individuals of all backgrounds and experiences. Applications are particularly welcome and encouraged from women, black, and minority ethnic candidates, who are under-represented in posts in the CML.

***Challenge: Predict reactive processes affecting groundwater quality***  

***Change: Quantify uncertainty of complex water quality models using surrogate modeling***  

***Impact: More reliable and safe water quality management***


Job description


Reactive transport models are essential for assessing groundwater quality and contamination risks, which are critical for safe drinking water. However, uncertainties in model parameters and data hinder accurate predictions. Traditional uncertainty quantification (so-called Bayesian) methods require extensive computational resources, hindering robust uncertainty quantification for complex models.



This PhD position offers an exciting opportunity to address this challenge by leveraging surrogate modeling techniques. Surrogate models approximate computationally intensive models at reduced cost, enabling uncertainty quantification despite time budget constraints. Recent advances in machine learning techniques also offer promising opportunities to improve surrogate modeling approaches. In this project, you will develop surrogate models tailored to reactive transport models and integrate them into an uncertainty quantification framework.


**Key responsibilities:**


* Design and implement surrogate modeling strategies for efficient uncertainty quantification of reactive transport models.
* Evaluate and propagate surrogate model errors to improve uncertainty estimates.
* Apply the developed framework to real-world case studies in collaboration with international working groups in the field of water quality modeling.


At the intersection of hydrogeology, biogeochemistry and statistics, this project bridges method development with applications in water quality modeling and process understanding. Our department brings together experts in water quality and reaction processes, mathematical modeling of environmental systems, and statistical and machine learning techniques in water resources. You will also collaborate with AIdroLab, part of TU Delft AI, and the Statistical Model-Data Integration group at the University of Stuttgart.


Requirements


* Very good Master's degree in a relevant field such as environmental science, environmental engineering, hydrogeology, physics, or applied mathematics.
* Strong interest in uncertainty quantification, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning techniques. Demonstrated experience in at least one of these areas is a plus.
* Familiarity with numerical modeling and scientific programming, for example using Python, Julia or R.
* Experience in modeling reactive transport in groundwater is preferred.
* Very good written and spoken English as you will be working in an international community.
* Enthusiasm for interdisciplinary research involving experts from hydrogeology to statistics.


Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis.

*Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Python, SQL, Tableau, AI*

 **Wat ga je doen?**

  


Als Senior Data Engineer bij Triple weet je als geen ander hoe data, waarde kan toevoegen voor onze klanten. Samen met het team ga je bouwen aan onze Data & Analytics oplossingen. Je voegt onbewerkte data samen en transformeert dit naar bruikbare informatie om waardevolle analyses te creëren. Ons team bestaat voornamelijk uit junior en medior Data Engineers. Je zult dus ook jouw collega’s begeleiden in de projecten die zij aan het uitvoeren zijn.

  



Met jouw expertise verwachten we dat je de volgende werkzaamheden zult uitvoeren:


* Een Microsoft Azure Native stack realiseren, bestaande uit o.a. ADLS, Data Factory, Synapse, Azure AS en PowerBI;
* Legacy (on-premise) omgevingen naar de cloud migreren als onderdeel van complexe landschap transformaties;
* Aanhaken bij de ontwikkelingen van cloud migratie en hoe we snel waarde kunnen toevoegen aan de klant;
* Standaardisatie van oplossingen op het gebied van data ontsluiten, kwaliteit en performance.

Binnen de verschillende projecten neem je de rol van beslisser op je, als het gaat om technische vraagstukkken. Denk hierbij aan type implementatie, code reviews en data modellering. Daarnaast ben je er niet vies om zelf de mouwen op te stropen. Je werkzaamheden buiten het begeleiden bestaan uit het bijwonen van meetings met potentiele klanten, het houden van kennissessies en interne data zaken.

  

Wat zoeken wij in jou?


* Je hebt tenminste HBO werk- en denkniveau;
* Je bent een analytische en conceptuele denker, die op strategisch niveau mee kan denken over Data architectuur;
* Aantoonbare werkervaring als Data Engineer;
* Vloeiend Nederlands en Engels.





Daarnaast heb je kennis van:


* Eén van de volgende cloud platformen: Azure, AWS, Snowflake en/of Google Cloud;
* Beheersing van SQL en/of Python;
* Ervaring met datamodelling (3NF, dimensioneel en/of Data Vault);
* Hybrid cloud, cloud infra en data & analytics concepten;
* Bouwen van data pipelines (ETL) met behulp van bijvoorbeeld Databricks, of andere ETL tools;
* DevOps en CI/CD gedreven ontwikkelstandaarden en -technieken;
* Een Azure, AWS of Snowflake certificering op het gebied van Data is een pré maar kan ook bij ons gehaald worden.

Voor die reis hebben wij het Data Talent Track. Een track waarin wij jouw carrière als Data Analyst bij Albert Heijn een vliegende start geven binnen onze Digital Analytics afdeling. Is dit echt iets voor jou? Word dan de nieuwe Data Analyst in ons Data Talent Track!

  

  

**Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst ken jij onze klant het beste. Deze kennis verkrijg je door gebruik te maken van data (zoals bijvoorbeeld data over koopgedrag), om zo de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van data-oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk met de nieuwste data analytics technieken. Je maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Analytics & Data Science team, en bent daarmee onderdeel van de grotere Analytics community binnen Albert Heijn. Je beweegt makkelijk tussen Tech, Data Science en de business teams, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data analytics toepassingen. Je maakt impact als Data Analist door:

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

  



**Dit doe je als Data Analyst Digital**

Het Digital domein richt zich op digitale relevantie, experimentation, eCommerce en klantloyaliteit. Hiervoor voeren we data-analyses uit of ontwikkelen wij dataproducten om onze e-commerce en Digital-afdelingen te ondersteunen met inzichten rondom onze klanten, het verbeteren van e-commerce en het verbeteren van de customer journey. Denk daarbij aan projecten zoals het relevanter maken van onze aanbiedingen (Mijn Bonus Box) of marketing, inzichtelijk maken van de omnichannel customer journeys en het analyseren van onze spaarprogramma’s.

  



**Jouw ontwikkeling in het Data Talent Track**

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten.

**Geef richting aan data-oplossingen en het ontwikkelen van software als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.

  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.  

  

Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?  

  

Naast een afgeronde Bachelor of Master en enkele jaren werkervaring zijn dit de specifieke skills die we zoeken:


* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met Python en PySpark.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met een Spark-omgeving als Azure Data Factory en/of Synapse.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met SQL DB en T-SQL.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 2 jaar) met PowerBI.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met Azure DevOps CI/CD processen.
* Ervaring met infra-as-code (IaC) in Bicep en Azure DevOps pipelines.
* Ervaring met verschillende data architecturen en modellen zoals DataVault, Star Schema en Data Mesh.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**Company**

A.P. Moller-Maersk (Maersk) is a worldwide transport and logistics company with offices in around 130 countries and with global headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark. Maersk is listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Maersk employs roughly 95,000 people and generated total revenue of 51 billion USD in 2023. Maersk is currently undergoing a complex transformation from having been a relatively diversified conglomerate to becoming a focused transport and logistics company.


APM Terminals (APMT), a maritime terminal operator and core business unit of Maersk, operates one of the world’s most comprehensive port networks, which is uniquely positioned to help both shipping line- and landside customers grow their business and achieve better supply chain efficiency, flexibility and dependability to compete and win in world markets. The APMT team of 23,000 industry professionals across 42 countries and spanning five continents, is focused on providing customers with the most advanced terminal technology, equipment and operations in the industry across a network of +75 ports. In 2023, APM Terminals generated revenues 3.8 billion USD and carried out 40 million TEUs.


APMT is, like Maersk, undergoing an all-encompassing transformation from a multi-local, loosely coupled portfolio of individual terminals towards an integrated, best-in-class global terminal operator and stevedore. We casually refer to the journey as ‘ *from freestyle to franchise’* . The transformation involves developing and rolling out APMT’s *Way of Working* , built around a common operating system founded on Lean principles. It also entails a fundamental overhaul of our (digital) enterprise architecture to enable data-fueled business decisions, and cross-pollination of standard processes across our operations, including automation. Finally, the transformation aims to embed a culture of joint problem solving, (local) entrepreneurship and a collaborative mindset across our organization, including strong(er) linkages between our HQ- and frontline teams.

Lastly, together with the team, you will need to work together to contribute to the broader roadmap of data-driven value identification across the business, contributing to the project plans and initiatives to achieve this.


This position requires a mix of strong analytical & logical thinking, business acumen, problem solving, data analysis skills and project management, as well as stakeholder management, soft skills and the ability to frame up, execute, and drive resolution to complex issues. This is a dynamic, fast paced role that involves simultaneously seeing the bigger picture along with the small pieces that are critical to success.


**We are looking for**

* A passion for working with business stakeholders in identifying value and improvement initiatives
* A strong analytical mind that can navigate complexity in operations and business, can distil priority areas, and can simplify this into a problem statement and (data-driven) solution plan
* Someone that utilizes data-savviness to think through use-cases and ensure that data solutions align with business and operational needs
* Someone with strong data analysis and modelling skills that can easily extract key insights and is able to spot key patterns in information. Proficiency in data analysis tools & techniques (Excel & SQL, data-querying or similar, advanced techniques are a plus)
* Someone that can present and visualize these insights in a logical and comprehensible way that helps drive actionable insights and supports business decisions. Proficiency in presentation, visualization and insights tools & techniques (Powerpoint & PowerBI or similar)
* Flexibility with the ability to manage multiple topics and projects simultaneously and take ownership and responsibility of projects, with the tenacity to see them through
* A collaborative team player that is hands-on with a can-do attitude and proactive
* Strong interpersonal and communication skills (both verbal and written). Possess empathy, personal tact, and multi-cultural understanding
* Strong project management skills, with experience in creating and managing project plans
* Familiarity with agile way-of-working and defining technical and business requirements
* A minimum of 4+ years work experience in a similar capacity, experience in generating or working with data-driven insights, and working with business and operational processes definition and analysis
* Consulting experience is a plus
* Experience with the logistics, transportation, or mining industry is a plus – experience in working with large complex (blue chip) companies is a must
* English fluency written and spoken, and international work experience is beneficial
* Based in the Netherlands, but willingness to travel
* Master’s degree in e.g., Math, Physics, Engineering, Econometrics, Finance, Business Administration, or similar

*Research shows that while male candidates feel confident enough to apply when they meet about 60% of the requirements, female candidates only apply when they tick every box. So if this role has your name on it, but you’re not sure about the criteria, we still want to hear from you.*

Het is een competitieve, dynamische wereld vol botsende belangen, maar ook een branche met talloze mooie innovaties en maatschappelijke uitdagingen, zoals: hoe verzekeren we de energietransitie, en de steeds grotere cybercrime dreiging?


In deze rol:

* Je hebt journalistieke ervaring, en een portfolio van artikelen en verhalen waar je trots op bent.
* Je bent nieuwsgierig, onderzoekend en kritisch en verdiept je graag in de hete hangijzers en trends binnen de branche.
* Je houdt van de afwisseling die werken op een redactie meebrengt, je vindt het leuk mee te denken over en te schakelen tussen het schrijven van nieuwsberichten en scoops enerzijds en inhoudelijke artikelen die diepgravend onderzoek vragen anderzijds.
* Je hebt kennis van de financiële dienstverlening, of bovengemiddelde interesse en de wil om snel alles te weten te komen over onze doelgroep.


**Ons aanbod**


* Bij VMN kom je om te leren, de ruimte om je journalistieke ideeën te realiseren, en voor de goede werk/privé balans. Wij werken hybride en je hebt veel vrijheid om je eigen werkweek in te delen.

Ook adviseer je collega’s over actuele dossiers van Stichting BKR en haar stakeholders, en bij communicatie-, reputatie- en merkvraagstukken. Je bevindingen zet je om in een communicatiestrategie- en aanpak, die je vervolgens samen met collega’s en soms externe bureaus uitvoert.
Je richt je vooral op de corporate communicatie en stemt daarom zaken af met diverse stakeholders: van medewerkers, klanten en media tot koepelorganisaties, belangenorganisaties en de overheid. De diverse belangen van betrokken partijen neem je mee bij het bedenken, coördineren en schrijven van diverse uitingen, zoals het BKR-magazine Inzichtelijk, de externe nieuwsbrieven, de Schulden Monitor, diverse barometers, content voor socialmediakanalen en andere communicatiemiddelen zoals persberichten. Je ondersteunt daarnaast soms ook jouw teammanager als aanspreekpunt voor mediarelaties, persoptredens en klant- en arbeidsmarktcommunicatie.
Je bent werkzaam in team Marketing & Communicatie, dat op dit moment bestaat uit een Communicatieadviseur en een Medewerker Marketing & Communicatie. Je rapporteert aan de Teammanager Marketing & Communicatie, die tevens je leidinggevende is.
Als je het leuk vindt om divers en intensief contact te hebben met verschillende stakeholders, en je het een uitdaging vindt om te werken in een omgeving waar veranderingen elkaar snel opvolgen, dan is dit een baan voor jou.

-------------------


  
Het ministerie van BZK ontvangt steeds meer en steeds omvangrijkere Woo-verzoeken. Om te zorgen voor de zorgvuldige én snelle afhandeling zoekt het ministerie enthousiaste en gedreven informatiespecialisten.


Als informatiespecialist werk je aan het efficiënt afhandelen van Woo-verzoeken. In Nederland heeft iedereen - burgers, bedrijven, het parlement en journalisten – recht op toegang tot informatie van de overheid. Dat is vastgelegd in de Wet open overheid (Woo), de opvolger van de Wet openbaarheid bestuur. Het is jouw taak om snel en zorgvuldig de benodigde documenten te vinden. Vervolgens beoordeel je de documenten en bereid je ze voor op openbaarmaking, door het lakken van de juiste informatie (zoals persoonsgegevens). Je werkt nauw samen met interne collega's, zoals dossierhouders en juristen, om ervoor te zorgen dat het proces soepel verloopt. Daarnaast draag je bij aan het verbeteren van onze processen door het implementeren van data-gedreven benaderingen en het verbeteren van onze tooling, zoals de laksoftware.


Je onderhoudt contacten met de collega’s binnen het ministerie en informeert betrokkenen over de voortgang van je werkzaamheden. Je signaleert snel problemen of stagnatie tijdens het afhandelingsproces en escaleert wanneer dat nodig is. Door goed samen te werken en oplossingsgericht te handelen, draag je bij aan een betere afhandeling van Woo-verzoeken.


Daarnaast werken we hard aan procesverbeteringen. Daarom willen wij het zoekproces naar relevante documenten steeds meer informatie gedreven inrichten, waarbij we gebruik maken van slimme tooling. Dat doe je als informatiespecialist door het bouwen van queries met de juiste zoektermen, om zo snel en gemakkelijk de relevantie documenten te vinden.


We zijn volop in ontwikkeling om dit te realiseren en zoeken nieuwe collega’s die hier hun steentje willen bijdragen. Ook draag je bij aan de doorontwikkeling van onze huidige instrumenten en tools, zoals onze laksoftware en de sturingsinformatie in ons dashboard.

* Je weet snel een weg te vinden in verschillende informatiebronnen, zoals ons documentmanagementsysteem, mailboxen en netwerkschijven;
* Je hebt kennis van wettelijke gronden waarop informatie beoordeeld dient te worden of bent bereid dit te leren;
* Je bent flexibel en je werkt graag oplossingsgericht;
* Je bent gewend om gestructureerd en waar nodig onder hoge tijdsdruk te werken;
* Je beschikt over uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



In november 2023 is het Woo-team gestart om binnen BZK te zorgen voor een versnelling en verbetering in de afhandeling van Woo-verzoeken. Ons team heeft een centrale plek in de organisatie en ontlast de beleidsdirecties bij het afhandelen van Woo-verzoeken. We werken nauw samen met de juridische afdeling van BZK. In ons team werken informatiespecialisten en Woo-regisseurs samen om de Woo-verzoeker beter van dienst te zijn en te zorgen voor een vlot en open proces. De Woo-regisseur voert regie op het proces en onderhoudt contacten met de verzoeker. We maken nu een vervolgstap in de ontwikkeling van het team. Het Woo-team groeit in aantal collega’s, zodat we bij meer Woo-verzoeken ondersteuning kunnen bieden. Ook breiden we uit qua juridische expertise. Daarmee kunnen we ook meer stappen in het proces ondersteunen.



**Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties**
------------------------------------------------------------



Het ministerie van BZK beschermt, bewaakt en bouwt aan de basis van onze samenleving. In Nederland en de Caribische delen van ons Koninkrijk. Uitgangspunt is ons grootste goed: de Grondwet en wat we daarin hebben afgesproken. Dat iedereen meetelt bijvoorbeeld. Dat je altijd en overal kan zijn wie je bent, kan vinden wat je vindt, gelijke kansen hebt en mee kan doen. Thuis, op school en op het werk. Offline en online. En dat iedereen prettig kan wonen in een fijne omgeving. We doen dat voor de samenleving én werken tegelijk aan de basis voor de hele rijksoverheid. Zodat andere ministeries hun werk voor Nederland ook goed kunnen doen.


Dit vraagt om collega's die samenwerken. Die gaan voor resultaat voor mensen, en daarbij niet alleen varen op vakinhoud, maar ook op hun moreel kompas. Aandacht hebben voor bijvoorbeeld rechtvaardigheid en gelijkwaardigheid. En om ons werk voor de samenleving écht goed te kunnen doen, vinden we het belangrijk dat we zelf een afspiegeling van die samenleving zijn. We zijn dus op zoek naar collega's met verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en eigenschappen. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent of van wie je houdt; we zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou. We willen zorgen voor een prettige werkplek voor iedereen, met veel ruimte voor werkplezier en ontwikkeling.",data journalist,https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl/vacatures/informatiespecialist-woo-verzoeken-BZK-2024-0701,https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/ministerie-van-binnenlandse-zaken-en-koninkrijksrelaties,,,"5,001 to 10,000",,,,,,,57af6ec7f513cb63,,nl,,,

 **Vacature**

**Communicatiemedewerker GGD** **(24 uur)**

 **Hoe ziet jouw toekomstige werkdag eruit?**  

Je start de werkdag goed met een lekkere kop koffie. Samen met je collega’s praat je bij over het weekend. Maar niet te lang, want aan het begin van de ochtend heb je meteen de weekstart van de GGD. Samen met je communicatiecollega’s bespreek je welke gezondheidsonderwerpen je de komende periode uitlicht. Dit doe je aan de hand van de omgevingsscan waarop je aanhaakt bij de behoefte van de inwoners, de contentplanning en ons jaarplan.


Hierna ga je gelijk aan de slag met het maken van content. De nieuwe social mediacampagne moet namelijk vandaag worden ingepland. Jij weet als geen ander hoe je met creatieve content de doelgroep kan bereiken. Naast je eigen kennis en ervaring, gebruik je hierbij de data en resultaten van eerdere, gelijksoortige campagnes.


De tijd vliegt en voor je het weet is het lunchtijd. Je loopt een rondje met je collega’s om even de benen te strekken. Als je terugkomt start een online meeting met een projectleider over een nieuwe voorlichtingscampagne. Je stelt vragen over doel, doelgroep en adviseert vervolgens over middelen.


Na de meeting neem je de tijd om je mail bij te werken. Je ontving een vraag van een journalist. Samen met de inhoudsdeskundige die de woordvoering doet, formuleer je de antwoorden op de vragen. Later deze week begeleid je het persmoment. Het laatste uur voer je een maandelijkse analyse uit om het gebruikersgedrag op de websites in beeld te brengen. Dit geeft weer nieuwe inzichten om de website te optimaliseren. Voldaan klap je je laptop dicht en verheug je je op morgen. Want morgen is weer een nieuwe dag die totaal anders kan zijn!

**Wat ga je doen?**  

Binnen onze veiligheidsregio hebben we de unieke combinatie van gezondheid (GGD) én veiligheid (Brandweer, Crisisbeheersing). Als communicatiemedewerker richt jij je op operationele taken van de GGD. Jouw werkgebied is breed en omvat afgebakende, uitvoerende werkzaamheden waarbij je nauw samenwerkt en spart met je communicatiecollega's.


Daarnaast zijn we een crisisorganisatie, wat betekent dat je ook bereid bent deel te nemen aan een communicatiepiket tijdens crisissituaties. Gemiddeld ben je 8 tot 10 keer per jaar een week lang bereikbaar en beschikbaar voor communicatieve werkzaamheden tijdens crisissituaties. Dit doe je samen met andere collega's die piket hebben die week.

* Diploma in communicatie of een vergelijkbare studie.
* Ervaring met traditionele en moderne communicatiemiddelen en campagnes.
* Top skills voor het maken pakkende teksten en beelden waarmee je onze doelgroep raakt.

* Echte teamplayer die graag samenwerkt.
* Passie voor verhalen vertellen en het bouwen van een sterk merk.
* Coachende vaardigheden en het vermogen om collega's te begeleiden en afdelingen te ondersteunen bij hun communicatie.

**Jouw team:**  

Je werkt in een leuk en enthousiast communicatieteam met 12 collega’s. Een team dat grotendeels bestaat uit jonge professionals, maar ook met enkele collega’s die al langer in het vak zitten. We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**  

Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA. Je komt te werken in een crisisorganisatie vol afwisseling. De coronacrisis, vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne, het hoogwater van de Maas of een grote brand. Wij waren erbij betrokken. Als communicatiemedewerker zit je bij ons nooit stil.


Je kunt je eigen werktijden en werkplek bepalen. Wij werken vanuit vertrouwen waarbij vrijheden en verantwoordelijkheden hand in hand gaan. Er zijn dus volop mogelijkheden om je privé- en werksituatie met elkaar te combineren.


Wij geven je de kans om te werken bij een organisatie met meerdere interessante en uitdagende werkvelden en een divers takenpakket. Binnen ons team zijn verschillende specialisaties aanwezig, waar jij als communicatiemedewerker van kunt leren en aan bij kunt dragen. Je kunt je bij ons helemaal uitleven.

* Alle faciliteiten om goed te kunnen werken, zoals een laptop en een telefoon;
* Een Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB). Het IKB is 18,63% van je brutoloon. Je kunt het IKB maandelijks naar eigen behoefte inzetten. Hiermee kun je korting krijgen bij een sportschool, een fiets aanschaffen of een extra opleiding volgen. Maar je mag het ook uit laten betalen of er extra vakantiedagen mee kopen

We werken hard, maar maken ook graag tijd vrij voor de ander en staan voor elkaar klaar met raad en daad, ongeacht de vraag. We gaan als team niet met elkaar op vakantie, maar een leuke activiteit, samen een hapje eten of een teamborrel vinden we belangrijk.
  

  

**Waarom zou je voor deze baan kiezen?**Werken voor onze Veiligheidsregio doet ertoe. Of het nu de GGD, Brandweer of Crisisbeheersing is, het gaat ergens om. Inwoners helpen zit in ons DNA. Je komt te werken in een crisisorganisatie vol afwisseling. De coronacrisis, vluchtelingen uit Oekraïne, het hoogwater van de Maas of een grote brand. Wij waren erbij betrokken. Als communicatiemedewerker zit je bij ons nooit stil.
  

  

Je kunt je eigen werktijden en werkplek bepalen. Wij werken vanuit vertrouwen waarbij vrijheden en verantwoordelijkheden hand in hand gaan. Er zijn dus volop mogelijkheden om je privé- en werksituatie met elkaar te combineren.
  

  

Wij geven je de kans om te werken bij een organisatie met meerdere interessante en uitdagende werkvelden en een divers takenpakket. Binnen ons team zijn verschillende specialisaties aanwezig, waar jij als communicatiemedewerker van kunt leren en aan bij kunt dragen. Je kunt je bij ons helemaal uitleven. Bij ons ben je in goede handen.
  

  

**Je krijgt ook:**  

* Een aanstelling voor een jaar voor 24 uur per week, met uitzicht op een vaste aanstelling;
* De mogelijkheid om hybride te werken inclusief bijhorende thuiswerkvergoeding;
* Een bruto maandsalaris tussen € 3.010 en € 4.302 (schaal 8) bij een fulltime dienstverband van 36 uur, afhankelijk van ervaring;
* Mogelijkheden om jezelf te ontwikkelen via trainingen, cursussen en opleidingen;
* Alle faciliteiten om goed te kunnen werken, zoals een laptop en een telefoon;
* Een Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB). Het IKB is 18,63% van je brutoloon. Je kunt het IKB maandelijks naar eigen behoefte inzetten. Hiermee kun je korting krijgen bij een sportschool, een fiets aanschaffen of een extra opleiding volgen. Maar je mag het ook uit laten betalen of er extra vakantiedagen mee kopen

**Functieomschrijving**  

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van het AD in Rotterdam. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data. Dat betekent dat je met cijfers bezig bent, maar ook veel met redactieleden overlegt en ze traint in hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter online presenteren.

De adviezen geef je op drie ‘snelheden’: live, in dag- en weekrapporten en in losse analyses. Op de dag zelf kijk je met een schuin oog mee naar de cijfers en deel je belangrijke actiegerichte inzichten met de redactie. In dag- en weekrapporten geef je duiding aan de cijfers. Naast de dagelijkse taken voer je ook regelmatig diepgravende analyses uit.

  


Je bent een belangrijke sparringpartner voor de chefs en hoofdredactie bij AD en werkt nauw met hen samen.

Het team Redactionele Inzichten & Groei (RI&G) werkt over Nederland én België. Met in Nederland 17 redactie-analisten verspreid over diverse nieuwsmerken. We werken aan creatieve oplossingen voor complexe vraagstukken. Dat lukt alleen met een fijne werksfeer en met goed teamwork. Naast redactie-analisten zijn er diverse centrale rollen in het team die jou bij je werk zullen ondersteunen.  

  

**Functieprofiel**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.


**VOORWAARDEN**


* salaris, passend bij jouw ervaring;
* 38-urige werkweek, minder uur in overleg;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;
* ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden d.m.v. opleidingen en trainingen;
* We geloven in een gezonde werk-privébalans waarbij je voldoende ruimte krijgt voor jouw welzijn en flexibel werken.

**Team Code**


Team Code houdt zich bezig met ontwerpend onderzoek. We ontwerpen nieuwe technologie en nemen publieke waarden als uitgangspunt: technologie is namelijk niet zomaar een instrument, maar kan het (samen)leven van mensen diepgaand beïnvloeden. Code kijkt hoe technologie de positie van burgers kan versterken: democratisering door middel van digitalisering. Het team bestaat uit software ontwerpers, techniek filosofen en sociale wetenschappers.

**Over Waag Futurelab**


Waag Futurelab doet al bijna 30 jaar onderzoek naar hoe technologie kan worden ingezet voor sociale innovatie. Bekende projecten van Waag zijn o.a. Fairphone, de meest duurzame smartphone ter wereld of De Digitale Stad, een van de allereerste social media platforms van Nederland. Of denk aan Operatie Sigismund, een van de eerste educatieve games in Nederland die leerlingen laat ervaren hoe spannend een archief is en nog steeds wekelijks gespeeld wordt in het Drents Archief.


 Je toekomstige collega Ouarda vertelt over werken bij Waag*: ‘De vrijheid die ik van de organisatie krijg om mijn eigen projecten in te kleuren doet mij heel erg goed. Collega’s waarderen mij, ik kan mezelf zijn en dat maakt het een fijne werkplek.’*


Waag werkt in een team van ontwerpers, kunstenaars en wetenschappers, dat publieke onderzoeksmethoden toepast op technologie en de samenleving. Daarmee stelt Waag zoveel mogelijk mensen in staat mee te ontwerpen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Dat doen we door gezamenlijk opkomende technologie te onderzoeken en onderliggende culturele aannames te bevragen en door alternatieven te ontwerpen op basis van publieke waarden. Zo proberen we bij te dragen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Op waag.org vind je meer informatie over Waag en over de projecten waaraan wij werken.


Diversiteit is cruciaal om technologie en de samenleving meer open, eerlijk en inclusief te maken. Daarom moedigen we kandidaten van diverse culturele achtergronden aan om te solliciteren. Mocht je denken niet aan alle eisen te voldoen, willen we je toch aanmoedigen om te solliciteren. Sommige kwaliteiten zijn niet in bulletpoints te vangen.

 **Vacature hoofdredacteur Arbo**



Van werkstress tot machineveiligheid en van hybride werken tot gevaarlijke stoffen. Arbo is het platform dat arboprofessionals ondersteunt in hun dagelijks werk. Door ze te informeren over ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken. Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.  

  

**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.



Als hoofdredacteur Arbo ben je onderdeel van de centrale redactie van het ‘professionals portfolio’ van VMN media, waar ook PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb onderdeel van zijn. Samen zijn we een team van 14 personen.

 **Wat krijg je:**


* **Fijn team** – Leuke, betrokken collega’s die samen mooie content voor de doelgroep maken. Binnen het Arbo-team, maar ook in nauwe samenwerking binnen het professionals portfolio.
* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.



Verder nog handig om te weten: het gaat om een functie van 36 uur per week. Het kantoor van VMN media staat in Zeist.
