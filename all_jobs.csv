Your duties will encompass technical aspects such as SQL and Python programming, performing Data Quality analyses, and integrating datasets.

-------------------

 **Do you want to commit to a critical challenge and help to shape our future?**


We keep important, revenue-critical systems up and running despite hurricanes, bandwidth outages, and configuration errors.


We are looking for a team member who is driven by technical challenges and the urge to always find better and more efficient ways of delivering services to the customer.  

  

**What will you do?**


In the role as SRE engineer you will combine the skillset of dev teams and operations teams by applying a software engineering approach to IT operations.


To succeed in this role it is important that you are self-driven, exact, analytic, critical and know how to prioritize. You are not only an expert in your field but you also have social competence and understand the business needs. You always challenge yourself and others to improve. You are also open for suggestions from others and can also give your own.


You are a team player and have a hands-on mindset, a strong customer- and problem-solving orientation. You show fast results, and you have demonstrated good communication skills, especially in an international organization. You need to be able to work independently in an international team that meets more virtually than physically.

  

  

**Your tasks and responsibilities:**

**Maintaining Applications to Help Operations and Support Teams**


As a SRE you are in charge of proactively implementing and maintaining infrastructure and business applications. This can be anything from provisioning servers, updating systems, deploying new software, providing pre-emptive maintenance to monitoring and alerting to code changes in production. A site reliability engineer can be tasked with building a homegrown tool from scratch to help with weaknesses in software delivery or incident management.


You must always be looking to improve quality and efficiency and cut costs.

**Fixing Support Escalation Issues**


Similarly to the point above, a site reliability engineer can be expected to spend time fixing support escalation cases.

**Optimizing On-Call Rotations and Processes**


More times than not, site reliability engineers will need to take on-call responsibilities and improve system reliability through the optimization of on-call processes. You will help add automation and context to alerts – leading to better real-time collaborative response from on-call responders. Additionally, you will update runbooks, tools and documentation to help prepare your on-call team members for future incidents.

**Documenting “Tribal” K****nowledge**


As you gain exposure to systems in both staging and production, as well as all technical teams, you will take part in work with software development, support, IT operations and on-call duties – meaning you will build up a great amount of historical knowledge over time. Instead of keeping this knowledge in the mind of one team or one person, as SRE you are expected to document much of what you know. Constant upkeep of documentation and runbooks can ensure teams get the information they need right when they need it.

**Conducting Post-Incident Reviews**


Without thorough post-incident reviews, you have no way to identify what’s working and what’s not. As such you will be participating in post-incident reviews, documenting your findings and taking action on your learnings.


Maybe also add \""provision new servers\""... it is attractive to have a more technical approach to woo away developers and coordinators!

 **Location**  

  

Katowice, Gliwice, Amsterdam or Solna

**Jouw profiel**
----------------

 **Who are you?**  

  

As our Site Reliability Engineer you:

* Are an expert in your field, strong technical and analytical skills, can solve impossible problems.
* Have the ability to translate complicated technical matters into simple understandable language.
* Have experience in building and operating of server virtualization environments.
* Have thorough knowledge of operating systems (Linux/Windows 2019 and up).
* Work with Agile methodology.
* Have experience in troubleshooting and root cause analysis.
* Are able to deal with tight deadlines when they arise.
* Have automation experience with at least one configuration/deployment management system (Ansible, Jenkins pipelines, Azure DevOps…).
* Have experience with at least one of the following scripting languages (Powershell, Shell, Python…).
* Have experience working with GIT.
* Have experience developing CI/CD.

  

Next to this you bring:

* Experience in a large international environment is desirable.
* Experience with containers is a plus.

**Extra informatie**
--------------------

 **Our offer**  

Good remuneration, a challenging and international work environment, and the possibility to work with some of the best in the field. You will be working in interdisciplinary teams and you can always count on support from committed colleagues. We offer attractive employment conditions and opportunities for personal and professional development.

 ***We do it right:*** When you’re moving fast it can be tempting to constantly cut corners to things done. But this results in a product that is a struggle to work with and has unhappy users. We make that extra effort to be proud of what we’re building; understand the problem we’re solving, write one more test or tackle technical debt.

 ***We are empowered to act, challenge and lead:*** To work effectively as a team everyone must have a voice and feel they can stand up and be counted. As a software engineer at Returnista we want you to feel empowered. That could mean proposing new ideas, fixing things without seeking permission or challenging the CEO.

* At least three years of professional research experience in relevant fields.

* Potential to thrive in a teal culture based on self-managed teams, able to take initiative, self-reflect and collaborate with colleagues.
* Comfortable in a globally inclusive, multi-cultural, fast-paced, agile, and virtual/hybrid environment that promotes flexibility whilst being able to meet deadlines.

**What are you going to do**  

The Postdoc will become part of an international team working on an ERC Consolidator funded project ‘MediaMinds’ directed by Dr. Wouter van den Bos (University of Amsterdam).  

***The project***
We have an urgent need to better understand the social media engagement of youth. Social media supports the specific developmental needs of youth, such as those for social connection. However, the increased sensitivity of the developing brain to social rewards may place youth especially at risk of compulsive use. In addition, youth’s sensitivity to social influence exposes another potential vulnerability, given that not all information is trustworthy. In this project we will focus on novel computational models to capture the complex interactions between developing motivational and cognitive processes, and specific social media affordances. We will take a multi-method approach relying on social media trace data, experience sampling, the development of novel ecologically valid experimental tasks, and neuroimaging.  

The team will consist of the PI, two PhDs and one Postdoc, as well as a large network of collaborators and co-supervisors. The total funding for this project is 2M euros for a period of 5 years and is divided over two main work packages. (for more detail WPs see here).

* Supervise RA’s and PhD’s working on the project;
* Draft pre-registrations and submit ethics reviews.
* Conduct data-analysis and prepare results for publications;
* Draft articles for publication in peer-reviewed journals;

Contribute to the Connected Minds Lab and the wider scientific community through collaborations, workshops, presentations/talks, attending conferences.

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=8b635dac2bd0c1f2,indeed,Data Analyst,Orbisk,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Orbisk,"Utrecht, UT, NL","parttime, fulltime",2024-07-31,,,,,True,,,,"**Our employees talk trash all day, every day.**

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**Assistance and Advisory Service (AAS)**



The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) is NATO's principal C3 capability deliverer and CIS service provider. It provides, maintains and defends the NATO enterprise-wide information technology infrastructure to enable Allies to consult together under Article IV, and, when required, stand together in the face of attack under Article V.



To provide these critical services, in the modern evolving dynamic environment the NCI Agency needs to build and maintain high performance-engaged workforce. The NCI Agency workforce strategically consists of three major categorise's: NATO International Civilians (NIC)'s, Military (Mil), and Interim Workforce Consultants (IWC)'s. The IWCs are a critical part of the overall NCI Agency workforce and make up approximately 15 percent of the total workforce.



**Role Background**

----------------


Are you a bachelor student within a technical study, such as Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, and are you looking for an apprentice internship? Do you enjoy programming? Are you skilled in MATLAB or Python? Would you like to apply your theoretical knowledge in a real world setting and gain some practical experience? Then this internship might be interesting to you!

**Background information**
--------------------------


The Metrology Leveling department is part of the Development and Engineering sector of ASML. Our primary focus is on measuring each silicon wafer prior to exposure inside the Twinscan, generating a surface map with nanometer precision. In addition, we also play a role in the calibration of the Twinscan itself and maintain the control of the ""measure sequence"", which includes both our measurements and those from other departments, such as Horizontal Alignment. Stage alignment (SA) is the functionality that is used to determine the position (and shape) of plates of the wafer stage with respect to the metro frame. These plates are used as a reference for other measurements - both on measure and on expose side. Which plate or plates are measured, on which plate reticle alignment is done and the type of measure sequence (Production, Robust, etc.) differs per platform.

**Your assignment**
-------------------


With the introduction of a new Stage Alignment sequence in software, we also need to update the diagnostics tool used to analyze and visualize data from the machine. One of the biggest diagnostics tools, FlatNG, needs to be updated to handle the analysis and visualization of data from this new sequence. This will allow customers to help troubleshoot their systems themselves or with the help of the local office. Therefore, this assignment consists of adding this new functionality to the diagnostics tool. Additionally, some other tasks may include fixing bugs in the tool or even attempting to link the measure sequence and stage alignment sequence tooling dashboards.

**Your profile**
----------------


To be a match for this internship, you:

* Are busy with your bachelor's in Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, or in a related technical study;
* Are skilled in MATLAB and/or Python;

Are you excited by figuring out what innovates and shapes eukaryotic genomes? Are you pursuing a PhD at the intersection of fundamental evolutionary research, microbiology and bioinformatics?***  

  

We invite you to apply for a vacant PhD position in our dynamic research team. In this role, you will have the opportunity to explore the evolutionary processes driving genetic innovation in eukaryotes, such as *de novo* gene invention, gene fusion, and horizontal gene transfer.  

  

The emergence of the complex eukaryotic cell, which gave rise to infamous lineages like plants, animals and fungi, comprises one of the major outstanding questions in evolutionary biology. The past decade has brought large progress in identifying the prokaryotic origins of eukaryotes. In this development, our group discovered the Asgard archaea, eukaryotes’ closest prokaryotic relatives, marking an important inflection point.  

  

Analyses of accumulating genome data yielded insights into which genomic changes contributed to the origin of the eukaryotic cell. Yet, for many key eukaryotic genes, we still don’t know how they came about. Similarly, how more recent eukaryotic lineages evolve is an open question, particularly for eukaryotic microbes, which dominate the eukaryotic tree of life, yet are poorly studied.  

  

As a PhD student in our lab, you will work in a stimulating environment. We are at the forefront of unravelling the deep origins of eukaryotic cells, and expand our explorations of the understudied world of eukaryotic microbes. You will utilize cutting-edge bioinformatics tools to trace the evolution of proteins and genomes. As a result, you will deepen our understanding of the origins and diversification of eukaryotic cellular complexity. You will have the opportunity to pursue your own research questions and implement your ideas.  

  

**Your responsibilities include:*** implementing state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools to scrutinize the evolutionary histories of eukaryotic proteins;
* interpreting large-scale evolutionary analyses in the framework of eukaryotic cellular complexity and diversity;
* contributing to teaching in our courses and supervising BSc and MSc thesis students.

**You will work here**  

This PhD position is embedded within the chair Laboratory of Microbiology, and member of the Microbial Evolution (MicEvo) team, which is led by Prof. dr. Thijs Ettema. Your daily supervisor will be Dr. Jolien van Hooff. Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:* partially paid parental leave;
* working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;
* the option to accrue additional compensation / holiday hours by working more, up to 40 hours per week;
* there is a strong focus on vitality and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
* a fixed December bonus of 8.3%;
* excellent pension scheme.


In addition to these first-rate employee benefits, you will receive a fully funded PhD position and you will be offered a course program tailored to your needs and the research team.  

  

The gross salary for the first year is € 2.770 - per month rising to € 3.539,- in the fourth year in according to the Collective Labour Agreements for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU) (scale P). This is based on a full-time working week of 38 hours. We offer a temporary contract for 18 months which will be extended for the duration of the project if you perform well.  

  

There are plenty of options for personal initiative in a learning environment, and we provide excellent training opportunities. We are offering a unique position in an international environment with a pleasant and open working atmosphere.  

  

You are going to work at the greenest and most innovative campus in Holland, and at a university that has been chosen as the “Best University” in the Netherlands for the 19th consecutive time.

Waar staat het LFI voor?



De Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) is een nieuw organisatieonderdeel van het RIVM. Het is de missie van de LFI om samen met haar ketenpartners de impact van de volgende pandemie op de volksgezondheid zo klein mogelijk te houden. Bij een infectieziektecrisis die een landelijke aanpak vereist, zorgt de LFI voor snelle opschaling en centrale aansturing van de medisch-operationele processen bij de GGD’en, zoals testen en vaccineren.



Om samen met de ketenpartners goed voorbereid te zijn, voert de LFI regie op onder andere het opleiden, trainen en oefenen van medewerkers en het maken van afspraken over informatievoorziening en snelle beschikbaarheid van grote aantallen medewerkers. Door de sterke verbinding met de GGD’en en het Centrum Infectieziektebestrijding (CIb) van het RIVM, kan de LFI snel opschalen bij een infectieziektecrisis.



De implementatie van de LFI is eind 2023 gestart en is naar verwachting eind 2026 voltooid. In deze periode geeft de LFI samen met GGD’en, andere onderdelen van het RIVM en het ministerie van VWS concrete invulling aan de ontwerpen voor onder andere aansturing, opgeschaalde diagnostiek en behandelen, grootschalig klantcontact, logistiek, scenario-ontwerp, crisiscommunicatie, informatiemanagement, inkoop, facilitaire diensten en financiën.

Waar staat de LFI voor?



De Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) is een nieuw organisatieonderdeel van het RIVM. Het is de missie van de LFI om samen met haar ketenpartners de impact van de volgende pandemie op de volksgezondheid zo klein mogelijk te houden. Bij een infectieziektecrisis die een landelijke aanpak vereist, zorgt de LFI voor snelle opschaling en centrale aansturing van de medisch-operationele processen bij de GGD’en, zoals testen en vaccineren.



Om samen met de ketenpartners goed voorbereid te zijn, voert de LFI regie op onder andere het opleiden, trainen en oefenen van medewerkers en het maken van afspraken over informatievoorziening en snelle beschikbaarheid van grote aantallen medewerkers. Door de sterke verbinding met de GGD’en en het Centrum Infectieziektebestrijding (CIb) van het RIVM, kan de LFI snel opschalen bij een infectieziektecrisis.



De implementatie van de LFI is eind 2023 gestart en is naar verwachting eind 2026 voltooid. In deze periode geeft de LFI samen met GGD’en, andere onderdelen van het RIVM en het ministerie van VWS concrete invulling aan de ontwerpen voor onder andere aansturing, opgeschaalde diagnostiek en behandelen, grootschalig klantcontact, logistiek, scenario-ontwerp, crisiscommunicatie, informatiemanagement, inkoop, facilitaire diensten en financiën.

We are looking for a motivated postdoctoral researcher with an interest and expertise in building computational models of body representation, technological augmentation, and embodiment. The goal of the project is to uncover the neurocognitive principles underlying the embodiment of finger-extending exoskeletons. To what extent do internal representations of the body and technology (e.g. exoskeletal fingers) fuse into a single representation? To make headway on answering this fundamental question, we will use a variety of neuroscientific approaches (behaviour and M/EEG) and analytical tools (computational modelling, machine learning).
  
  

**You will be part of the NOW VIDI Grant ’Human 2.0:** A neurocognitive framework for upgrading the body’. As a postdoctoral researcher, you will design novel behavioural and neuroimaging paradigms (EEG) to measure internal representations of the body and tools (specifically, finger-extending exoskeletons), as well as their fusion. In this project, we endeavour to understand the fusion process at a neurocomputational level. You will apply Bayesian modelling to behavioural data to characterise the somatosensory and multisensory transformations underlying fusion. You will then use machine learning approaches to identify neural signatures of their implementation in EEG signals. The overall goal of these experiments is to gain a better understanding of the embodiment of technology at a computational and neural level. There will be close collaboration with other members of the team, including colleagues throughout the Donders Institute. Project management and mentoring (MSc and BSc) will also be part of your responsibilities.
  
  

Profile

Previous experience with computational modelling and/or machine learning is an advantage.
  
You have substantial experience with at least one common programming language (Matlab, Python, R, C++), including the use of neuroimaging toolboxes for analysis (e.g. FieldTrip, SPM, etc.).
  
You have previous experience publishing peer-reviewed journal articles (at least two published papers (preprints included)).
  
You are a team player and possess good social, communication and organisational skills.
  
You have a passion for science and the pursuit of knowledge.

Bijvoorbeeld door kansen voor doelmatigheidsonderzoeken waarin data-analyse een grote rol speelt te herkennen en deze te vertalen in onderzoeksvoorstellen. Je werkt hierin samen met collega’s met minder statistische kennis (medeonderzoekers, maar ook onze bestuurders). Je voert gesprekken met mensen die werken bij overheidsorganisaties om te inventariseren welke mogelijkheden en beperkingen er zijn voor data-analyse in het onderzoek en gebruikt deze inzichten voor het opstellen van een haalbaar plan van aanpak. Vervolgens zorg je ook tijdens de uitvoering van het onderzoek voor de succesvolle uitvoering van de geplande analyses en stuurt wanneer dat nodig is bij. Tot slot weet je de complexe uitkomsten te vertalen naar duidelijke aanbevelingen voor bijvoorbeeld de onderzochte partijen, Tweede Kamerleden en/of verantwoordelijk bewindspersonen.


**Over de Algemene Rekenkamer**
-------------------------------


Wij onderzoeken of de rijksoverheid zinnig, zuinig en zorgvuldig omgaat met publiek geld. Het is onze wettelijke taak de inkomsten en uitgaven van het Rijk te controleren. Op Verantwoordingsdag, de derde woensdag in mei, rapporteren we aan het parlement wat onze bevindingen zijn. Op basis van ons oordeel kan het parlement besluiten of het decharge verleent aan het kabinet. Daarnaast brengen we rapporten uit over onderzoeken naar beleid van ministers. Zo helpen we Kamerleden te bepalen of dat beleid werkt.

* 
**Het team**
------------


Binnen de Algemene Rekenkamer houdt de Data Hub (ca 10 fte en onderdeel van de directie Audit & Data) zich bezig met het bevorderen van data-analyse binnen de organisatie en in onderzoek.


Het team bestaat uit kwantitatief onderzoekers en business informatie analisten met verschillende disciplinaire achtergronden. Voor dit team zoeken we een kwantitatief onderzoeker beleidsonderzoek met ervaring in het toepassen van kwantitatieve methoden en technieken van onderzoek om inzicht te krijgen in de effectiviteit en efficiëntie van beleid. Samen zorgen we voor:


* De ondersteuning van onderzoeksteams met de voorbereiding en uitvoering van onderzoeksprojecten waarin kwantitatieve methoden een belangrijk onderdeel vormen. We geven sturing aan (deel)projecten. En maken daarbij gebruik van wetenschappelijk verantwoorde werkwijzen.
* Methodologisch advies in de ontwerpfase van nieuwe onderzoeksprojecten. We zijn proactief en brengen onze methodische kennis ook goed over aan collega’s die over minder kwantitatieve kennis beschikken.
* Het vergroten van datavaardigheden van collega’s binnen de Algemene Rekenkamer. Denk aan het helpen van een collega met code review of het geven van cursussen en ontwikkelen van ondersteunende materialen. Maar ook aan het organiseren van kennisuitwisseling, zoals deep dives binnen de organisatie en met nationale en internationale partners.

### **Profiel**


Als business controller ben je samenwerkend, initiatiefrijk, analytisch sterk en beschik je over overtuigingskracht. Je bent een snelle denker die durft om zich kritisch op te stellen. Daarnaast ben je ondersteunend en verbindend, met een sterk vermogen om advies te geven. Je kunt zowel zelfstandig als in teamverband werken. Je hebt een stevige persoonlijkheid en uitstekende mondelinge en schriftelijke communicatieve vaardigheden.  

  

Specifieke functie eisen:


* Je hebt affiniteit en ervaring met data-analyses en weet registratieve (o.a. boekhoud) systemen conceptueel snel met elkaar te verbinden en data uit deze te vertalen naar bruikbare inzichten op strategisch en tactisch niveau.
* Je beschikt over excellente Excel vaardigheden. Modellen opstellen met behulp van PowerBI of PowerQuery, PowerPivot en af en toe wat VBA, is jouw ding.
* Ervaring met/ kennis van SQL of R, is een pluspunt.
* Ervaring binnen een onderwijs- of onderzoekinstelling is een pluspunt.

  

 

Bekijk hier de voorwaarden voor indiensttreding bij Erasmus MC.


  
### **Wat bieden wij**

* Doorgroeimogelijkheden en opleidingen.
* Gedeeltelijk thuiswerken behoort tot de mogelijkheden, net als 4 x 9 uur werken.
* Een 13e maand die we in november uitkeren en een reiskostenvergoeding.
* Een pensioenverzekering bij het ABP. Wij betalen 70% van je pensioenpremie.
* Sportfaciliteiten in het Erasmus MC. En heb je een lekke band? Onze fietsenmaker repareert deze graag.

If better treatment becomes available and is widely implemented, the number of years to achieve zero leprosy will decrease. NLR is working on an enhanced regimen, PEP++, that is expected to be 80-90% effective. To scale up prevention of leprosy supported by PEP services research, innovation and building up an evidence based track record are required.

Je gaat ons helpen om het speelveld van vastgoed volledig op zijn kop te zetten. We denken dat de data revolutie dat mogelijk maakt en willen daar een serieuze bijdrage aan leveren. De beschikbaarheid van data zal meer fundament leggen onder elke vastgoedbeslissing. Het kan nu evidence-based (en tsja, als het kan dan moet het ook).

Je gaat onze opdrachtgevers helpen met het nemen van goed onderbouwde beslissingen. Je gaat data opsporen, ontsluiten en presenteren. Door slimme algoritmen zorg je er voor dat onze opdrachtgevers tot betere inzichten komen. Kortom: je gaat je data-skills inzetten om echte problemen op te lossen. Begrip van de context is daarvoor noodzakelijk. Vaak werk je dan ook samen met onze vastgoedspecialisten, samen komen jullie tot de beste oplossing.

Je pioniert samen met een team aan onze innovaties. Het zou mooi zijn als je ervaring hebt met ETL en R, maar daar kunnen we je ook bij helpen. Je werkt meestal aan drie of vier projecten tegelijkertijd. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan de ontwikkeling van tooling voor assetmanagement, de waardering van woningportefeuilles op basis van open data of een benchmark van het voorzieningenniveau van gemeenten. Sommige projecten zijn kort en intensief, andere projecten vereisen een langere aanloop. Het mooie van consultancy is dat je alleen wordt ingehuurd voor de spannende projecten. De projecten die er toe doen.

Je komt in aanraking met allerlei soorten opdrachtgevers en allerlei type vraagstukken in een steeds veranderende context. Die afwisseling en uitdaging maakt dat je snel leert. Daarnaast kun je er van op aan dat onze ervaren data specialisten je helpen in jouw ontwikkeling.

Geen eindeloze overleggen, trage besluitvorming en overlopende email-box maar alle tijd en ruimte om echt met mijn vak bezig te zijn. Elke dag weer. Mijn vastberadenheid om ook echt impact te maken sluit naadloos aan bij de rest van het team. Samen zetten we de schouders er onder en zorgen we dat het lukt.”*

Leoniek Driessens

*“Ervaring of functie zijn van ondergeschikt belang, het draait om de inhoud. Dat merkte ik al in de eerste maand van mijn afstudeerperiode: ik ging meteen mee op een driedaagse ‘field-trip’ bij een corporatie in Groningen. En daar werd ook nog verwacht dat ik een serieuze bijdrage zou leveren aan het project. Mijn collega’s dagen me elke dag uit om een nog betere adviseur te worden. Soms door me te helpen maar soms ook door me bewust even te laten verzuipen en me te leren om zelf tot oplossingen te komen.”*

The Departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/Psychology and Radiology & Nuclear Medicine are hiring a full-time Imaging Data Manager.  

  

As data manager you will work with two of the world’s largest neuroimaging cohort studies in addition to several novel clinical studies. First, the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/Psychology has been collecting neuroimaging data in the Generation R Study, a population-based birth cohort, since 2008. Second, the Departments of Epidemiology and Radiology have been collecting neuroimaging data in the Rotterdam Study, a longitudinal cohort of aging, since 2005. Lastly, the Departments of Radiology and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/Psychology has several ongoing clinical studies where (anonymized) imaging data needs to be retrieved from different centres (both nationally and internationally) and maintained in a database that adheres to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable & Reproducible). The data manager is actively working with and contributing to the data management plan of the department(s).  

  

Between the two departments, over 30 researchers are actively using (neuro) imaging data from more than 25,000 scan sessions. You will be responsible for helping researchers on the team organize imaging data.

De Corporate Dienst Datafundamenten en Analytics (DF&A) werkt voor directies van de Belastingdienst die belast zijn met de fiscale behandeling van burgers en bedrijven én voor bedrijfsvoering. DF&A levert signaalmodellen en informatiedashboards die zijn gebaseerd op de analyse van ‘big data’ en die de organisatie inzicht geven in de mogelijkheden om werkzaamheden slimmer en beter uit te voeren.

De signaalmodellen en dashboards worden gebouwd door gebruik te maken van innovatieve IT-ontwikkelingen en het koppelen van zeer divers aangeleverde data. DF&A maakt hiervoor gebruik van een zelfontwikkelde methodiek om data op te bouwen tot datafundamenten, die de basis zijn voor de producten.

**Functiegebied** IT **Vacature nr.** 1180
  
Werken bij Sanquin betekent mensenlevens redden. Niet één keer, maar elke dag opnieuw. Dat doen we met bloedproducten en geneesmiddelen die veilig en beschikbaar zijn voor iedereen die ze nodig heeft. De kwaliteit van onze bloedproducten en geneesmiddelen bewaken we continue en daar hebben we jou bij nodig. Wil jij ook werk doen dat er écht toedoet? Word dan Computer System Validation (CSV) engineer bij ons.

**Jij & Sanquin**
  

In Nederland doneren honderdduizenden mensen bloed bij Sanquin: de Nederlandse bloedbank en hét instituut voor kennis en innovatie op gebied van bloed. Die donaties worden getest en verwerkt, en vinden uiteindelijk hun weg naar patiënten wereldwijd. Ieder stapje in dat proces, van gever tot ontvanger, wordt geregistreerd en bewaard. Daardoor hebben vrijwel alle bedrijfsprocessen binnen Sanquin een link met QRC, en door toenemende digitalisering wordt dat alleen maar meer. Als CSV engineer borg jij dat bestaande en nieuwe systemen en applicaties voldoen aan de relevante (o.a. GxP, AVG) wet- en regelgeving. Zo zorgen jij en Sanquin ervoor dat de gegevens van donors en patiënten altijd veilig zijn.  

  

**Wat worden je taken en verantwoordelijkheden?**  

* Uitvoeren en/of begeleiden van hervalidaties en herkwalificaties;
* Betrokkenheid bij interne en externe inspecties;
* Ondersteuning bij implementaties van change control;
* Governance en planning van de periodieke (her)validatieactiviteiten uit het Master Validation Plan;
* Samenwerken met lokale projectteams om de omvang van wijzigingen te bepalen en relevante documentatie voor te bereiden;
* Uitvoeren en goedkeuren van protocollen in het elektronische validatiesysteem;
* Automatiseringsdocumenten beoordelen en goedkeuren.

  

**Hoe ziet je dag eruit?**
  

Grote kans dat je de werkdag start met een overleg: je bent bij tal van projecten betrokken, met name in de beginfase als de ontwerpen getoetst worden aan wet- en regelgeving. Dan adviseer je de IT-collega’s van het betrokken team of begeleid je sessie waarbij meerdere disciplines binnen Sanquin zijn betrokken. De CSV activiteiten strekken zich uit van IT infrastructuur kwalificatie tot applicatie validatie. Daarmee moet je rekening houden met de toepassing van IaaS, PaaS en SaaS oplossingen binnen ICT. Om op de hoogte te blijven van de nieuwste ontwikkelingen rondom CSV in een bruisende IT omgeving, volg je geregeld een training en spar je regelmatig met de collega’s.  

  

**Waar lever jij meerwaarde?**
  

Je hebt al ervaring (op minimaal HBO-niveau) als CSV-engineer in een GxP-gereguleerde industrie, dus met je kennis van kwaliteitssystemen en -richtlijnen (ISO9001, GMP, GAMP, etc.) zit het wel goed. Maar jouw echte meerwaarde zit in je people skills. Je werkt makkelijk samen met mensen op verschillende niveaus in de organisatie, en schakelt daarbij moeiteloos tussen de vele projecten en systemen die je tegelijk onder handen hebt. Je hebt overtuigingskracht en weet mensen mee te krijgen, ook als jouw boodschap een lastige is. En last but not least, barst je van de ideeën en energie om de (ambitieuze) strategie van Sanquin QRC te realiseren. Er gaat de komende jaren veel gebeuren. We gaan applicaties en infrastructuur naar de cloud brengen, processen optimaliseren en digitaliseren, en willen veel meer halen uit de berg aan waardevolle data waarover Sanquin beschikt.  

  

Als CSV Engineer bij Sanquin maak je deel uit van de nieuw gevormde QRC-afdeling, die zich richt op kwaliteit, risico en compliance. Deze afdeling bestaat uit verschillende teams, waaronder Interne Audit, Risicomanagement & Compliance, QA-management, Regulatory Compliance en Relatiebeheer QRC. Als CSV Engineer val je onder het team Relatiebeheer QRC, dat dagelijks contact onderhoudt met alle afdelingen en samen met hen kijkt hoe we het beste dashboards, audits en risico’s kunnen duiden en daarvan kunnen leren en verbeteren. Je werkt nauw samen met andere experts binnen de afdeling, zoals de Information Security Officer en de Informatie Analist. Je rol als CSV Engineer is cruciaal in het ondersteunen van de organisatie om te voldoen aan de kwaliteitsnormen en regelgeving.  

  

**Wat breng je daarvoor mee?**  

* Organisatiesensitiviteit en het vermogen om effectief met allerlei stakeholders om te gaan;
* Gedegen kennis van kwaliteitsborgingsystemen met GMP/GXP richtlijnen;
* kennis van Office 365;
* begrip van computernetwerken, cloud computing, hardware;
* Een scherp oog voor detail en kwaliteit;
* Een ordelijke en systematische aanpak;
* De flexibiliteit om te wisselen tussen zelfstandig werken en in teamverband.

  

**Whats in it for you?**  

  

Een afwisselende en zelfstandige baan waarin je je verder kunt ontwikkelen binnen een unieke organisatie. Nergens anders ter wereld wordt medische, farmaceutische en wetenschappelijke kennis in één innovatieve onderneming gecombineerd.  

  

De arbeidsvoorwaarden conform CAO Sanquin (FWG schaal 55), op basis van 36 uur per week, zien er als volgt uit:  

* Een salaris van bruto minimaal €3.290,- tot maximaal €4,480,- per maand. Je wordt ingeschaald op basis van je relevante ervaring en capaciteiten;
* 8,33% eindejaarsuitkering en 8,33% vakantiegeld, flexibel opneembaar;
* 201 verlofuren bij een fulltime (36 uur) dienstverband;
* Een ruime reiskostenvergoeding, tegemoetkoming vanaf de eerste kilometer;

-------------------


  
Binnen het Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM) ontwikkelt de Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) zich tot een sterke crisisorganisatie. Bij de LFI werk je nauw samen met ketenpartners binnen en buiten het RIVM in een politiek-bestuurlijke context. Een uitdagende functie waarin jij jouw flexibiliteit, wendbaarheid en talent om snel tot oplossingen te komen optimaal kunt inzetten. De data analisten maken deel uit van het LFI datalab. LFI Datalab focust op het verzamelen en visualiseren van kerncijfers en KPI’s over de medisch-operationele processen voor de LFI. Als data analist speel je een cruciale rol in de informatieketen door data te analyseren en inzichten te genereren, binnen een maatschappelijke context. Deze analyses ondersteunen de ontwikkeling van informatiemodellen en functionaliteiten, zo maak jij het verschil.



Wat ga je doen



Je begint je dag als LFI data analist om 9:00 op het RIVM-kantoor in Bilthoven of thuis met een stand-up meeting. Hierbij worden de voortgang en knelpunten van huidige projecten en de algemene situatie binnen het LFI Datalab besproken. Daarna ga je verder met de ontwikkeling van verschillende soorten informatieproducten, van een dashboard dat het lab landschap van Nederland in kaart brengt tot het visualiseren van real-time GGD-informatie. Tijdens de pauze is er tijd voor ontspanning, zoals een boswandeling of een gezellige lunch in de kantine. Vervolgens neem je deel aan verschillende meetings, waaronder intakegesprekken voor nieuwe informatieproducten met andere LFI-functies en sessies met de RIVM IV organisatie om het benodigde dataplatform juist in te richten. De dag sluit je af met het bijwerken van e-mails en het voorbereiden van kennisdelingssessies met ketenpartners zoals GGDGHOR of VWS. Zo draagt de data-analist bij aan de voorbereiding van de bestrijding van een eventuele toekomstige pandemie, waarbij de juiste stuur- en verantwoordingsrapportages cruciaal zijn.



Een greep uit je taken en werkzaamheden:


* als trekker maak je een plan van aanpak voor het verkrijgen van cruciale data ter ondersteuning van onze bedrijfsprocessen, en bewaak je nauwgezet de voortgang van projecten.
* als bruggenbouwer tussen business en IV-organisatie overstijg je afdelingen en breng je informatievraagstukken tot leven door samen met de business functionele vragen te definiëren en oplossingsrichtingen te ontwerpen. Of het nu gaat om het ontwikkelen van nieuwe producten of het matchen van bestaande instrumenten, jij bent in staat een goede oplossing te bieden.
* jij bent de drijvende kracht achter het verzamelen, prepareren, controleren en analyseren van data, waarmee we ons werk verbeteren en het maatschappelijk effect vergroten. Dankzij jouw inzicht en expertise kunnen we vroegtijdig trends signaleren en risicoprofielen opzetten om proactief te handelen en strategische en tactische beslissingen nemen;
* jij ontwikkelt dynamische dashboards en rapporten die onze organisatie voorzien van cruciale stuurinformatie.

---------------------------------------



Waar staat het LFI voor?



De Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) is een nieuw organisatieonderdeel van het RIVM. Het is de missie van de LFI om samen met haar ketenpartners de impact van de volgende pandemie op de volksgezondheid zo klein mogelijk te houden. Bij een infectieziektecrisis die een landelijke aanpak vereist, zorgt de LFI voor snelle opschaling en centrale aansturing van de medisch-operationele processen bij de GGD’en, zoals testen en vaccineren.



Om samen met de ketenpartners goed voorbereid te zijn, voert de LFI regie op onder andere het opleiden, trainen en oefenen van medewerkers en het maken van afspraken over informatievoorziening en snelle beschikbaarheid van grote aantallen medewerkers. Door de sterke verbinding met de GGD’en en het Centrum Infectieziektebestrijding (CIb) van het RIVM, kan de LFI snel opschalen bij een infectieziektecrisis.



De implementatie van de LFI is eind 2023 gestart en is naar verwachting eind 2026 voltooid. In deze periode geeft de LFI samen met GGD’en, andere onderdelen van het RIVM en het ministerie van VWS concrete invulling aan de ontwerpen voor onder andere aansturing, opgeschaalde diagnostiek en behandelen, grootschalig klantcontact, logistiek, scenario-ontwerp, crisiscommunicatie, informatiemanagement, inkoop, facilitaire diensten en financiën.

Je voert gesprekken met mensen die werken bij overheidsorganisaties om te inventariseren welke mogelijkheden en beperkingen er zijn voor data-analyse in het onderzoek en gebruikt deze inzichten voor het opstellen van een haalbaar plan van aanpak. Vervolgens zorg je ook tijdens de uitvoering van het onderzoek voor de succesvolle uitvoering van de geplande analyses en stuurt wanneer dat nodig is bij. Tot slot weet je de complexe uitkomsten te vertalen naar duidelijke aanbevelingen voor bijvoorbeeld de onderzochte partijen, Tweede Kamerleden en/of verantwoordelijk bewindspersonen.


**Over de Algemene Rekenkamer**
-------------------------------


Wij onderzoeken of de rijksoverheid zinnig, zuinig en zorgvuldig omgaat met publiek geld. Het is onze wettelijke taak de inkomsten en uitgaven van het Rijk te controleren. Op Verantwoordingsdag, de derde woensdag in mei, rapporteren we aan het parlement wat onze bevindingen zijn. Op basis van ons oordeel kan het parlement besluiten of het decharge verleent aan het kabinet. Daarnaast brengen we rapporten uit over onderzoeken naar beleid van ministers. Zo helpen we Kamerleden te bepalen of dat beleid werkt.

**Het team**
------------


Binnen de Algemene Rekenkamer houdt de Data Hub (ca 10 fte en onderdeel van de directie Audit & Data) zich bezig met het bevorderen van data-analyse binnen de organisatie en in onderzoek.


Het team bestaat uit kwantitatief onderzoekers en business informatie analisten met verschillende disciplinaire achtergronden. Voor dit team zoeken we een kwantitatief onderzoeker beleidsonderzoek met ervaring in het toepassen van kwantitatieve methoden en technieken van onderzoek om inzicht te krijgen in de effectiviteit en efficiëntie van beleid. Samen zorgen we voor:


* De ondersteuning van onderzoeksteams met de voorbereiding en uitvoering van onderzoeksprojecten waarin kwantitatieve methoden een belangrijk onderdeel vormen. We geven sturing aan (deel)projecten. En maken daarbij gebruik van wetenschappelijk verantwoorde werkwijzen.
* Methodologisch advies in de ontwerpfase van nieuwe onderzoeksprojecten. We zijn proactief en brengen onze methodische kennis ook goed over aan collega’s die over minder kwantitatieve kennis beschikken.
* Het vergroten van datavaardigheden van collega’s binnen de Algemene Rekenkamer. Denk aan het helpen van een collega met code review of het geven van cursussen en ontwikkelen van ondersteunende materialen. Maar ook aan het organiseren van kennisuitwisseling, zoals deep dives binnen de organisatie en met nationale en internationale partners.

Barneveld is geselecteerd als een van de vijf pilot labs in het ambitieuze programma om één LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) voor zowel de Food en Environment business te ontwikkelen. 2021 gaat het jaar worden waarin de laatste ontwikkelingen plaats zullen vinden en het nieuwe LIMS live zal gaan in Barneveld. Vanwege de hoge mate van automatisering en robotisering op de locaties in Amsterdam en Barneveld zullen een aantal functionaliteiten door onszelf (her-)ontwikkeld gaan worden. Hier zul jij een cruciale rol in gaan spelen.


Als senior developer ontwikkel je programma’s die het lab ondersteunen in behoud van Eurofins’ marktleiderschap in de BeNeLux. Je werkt bijv. aan de integratie van het LIMS systeem in de operatie, het klantportaal waar klanten online hun orders indienen, applicaties ter ondersteuning van analyses in het lab of het integreren van de data die door onze koeriers in het veld worden gescand en on-line doorgestuurd.


We bevinden ons dicht bij de operatie en hebben daarom korte lijnen met de eindgebruikers. Samen met de andere leden van je scrum team (developers, testers, business analysten en product owner) kun je dus snel schakelen. Met kort cyclisch ontwikkelen kunnen we nieuwe software/features snel opleveren en hierop terugkoppeling ontvangen. Dit is mede mogelijk door inzet van o.a. automatische deployment, unit testing en software-kwaliteitschecks.


We verwachten dat je senioriteit meebrengt en het ontwikkel team op een hoger niveau brengt, in bijv. design patterns, .Net best practices, micro services, etc. Naast dat je dit weet toe te passen kun je dit door je natuurlijke leiderschapsrol ook overbrengen op je collega-developers.


Naast de LIMS implementatie blijven we ook op IT gebied innoveren. Binnen Eurofins is een strategische keuze gemaakt om naar de Azure Cloud te gaan, hierbij beginnen de eerste experimenten nu vorm te krijgen. De verwachting is dat jij hier ook een leidende rol in gaat spelen.

 **Functie-eisen**  

* Programmeren van innovatieve, robuuste software waarmee het lab de leiderschapspositie binnen de BeNeLux behoud
* Je bent in staat om Product Owner en business vertegenwoordigers te overtuigen in vraagstukken rond kosten/baten, prioriteitsstelling en diverse kwaliteitsaspecten om gezamenlijk te komen tot de beste oplossing voor de organisatie.

BetterHelp is on a mission to remove the traditional barriers to therapy and make mental health care more accessible to everyone. Founded in 2013, we are now the world’s largest online therapy service – providing affordable and convenient therapy in 210 countries and over 60 languages across the globe. Our network of over 30,000 licensed therapists has helped millions of people take ownership of their mental health and change their lives forever. And we’re not stopping there – as the unmet need for mental health services continues to grow, BetterHelp is committed to being part of the solution.  

  

As an Clinical Operations Manager (Netherlands) at BetterHelp, you’ll join a diverse team of licensed clinicians, engineers, product pros, creatives, marketers, and business leaders who share a passion for expanding access to therapy. And as a mental health company, we take employee mental health just as seriously as we do our mission. We seriously invest in our team’s well-being and professional development, because we know that business and individual growth go hand-in-hand.  

  

At BetterHelp, you’ll carve your own path, make an immediate impact, and be challenged every day – with a supportive community behind you the whole way.

**What are we looking for?**


We are looking for a hard-working, passionate, fast-paced individual with experience providing direct clinical care to join our global Clinical Operations Team. Our Clinical Operations teammates are the liaison between BetterHelp members, the therapists, and the technology platform; and they consistently help our company to improve efficacy and quality between the three.  

  

You are a self-starter with a growth mindset that spans clinical quality, business development, and the rapid pace of change characteristic of a tech startup. With your experience and opinions from direct clinical care, you are confident in your abilities to apply the best of “what’s working today” in the mental healthcare system, while being a vocal proponent of what “red tape” should be eliminated or redesigned to better serve clients and their therapeutic progress.  

  

This is a role that is primed for extreme individual career growth and development, combined with the opportunity to change how mental healthcare services are accessed both domestically and internationally.


Note that, initially at least, this is an individual contributor role and not a people manager role.

**What will you do?**

* You will provide support via email, phone, and chat on a daily basis to our rapidly growing therapist network, in order to ensure they are always well-equipped to provide high-quality clinical care to our members.
* You will act as a point of escalation for complex customer and therapist questions to ensure quality improvement, and you will organize cross-functional teams as needed to resolve any escalations.
* You will be accountable for auditing qualitative, quantitative, and/or episodic data and provide fair, actionable, and constructive clinical feedback to therapists.
* You will monitor the clinical capabilities and relevant work experience of therapists applying to be part of the BetterHelp platform.
* You will proactively conduct outreach and maintain productive communications with therapists to get feedback, improve satisfaction, and prevent churn.
* You will maintain a small client caseload on the BetterHelp platform.
* You will work closely with our Marketing Team and participate in public speaking events, media interviews, and appear on BetterHelp's social media channels. The Clinical Operations Manager plays an active role in representing BetterHelp to external stakeholders (members, prospects, media, and government entities).
* You will stay up to date with the regulatory environment, with support from our Legal Team and our Provider Network Team, and you will clearly communicate changes to the organization to support compliance with mental health ethical and legal standards.
* This role also works cross-functionally throughout BetterHelp on a daily basis - partnering closely with Member Success, Therapist Success, Therapist Acquisition, Legal, Product, Engineering, Data & Analytics, and more. Additionally, the International Clinical Operations Manager plays an active role in representing BetterHelp to external stakeholders (clients, prospects, media, and government entities).
* You will take on other duties and special projects as needed, including, but not limited to: recruiting, credentialing, therapist utilization, therapist retention, member experience, therapist experience, and so on.

**What will you NOT do?**

* You will NOT worry about funding. We have startup DNA, but we're fully backed and funded by our parent company, Teladoc Health.
* You will NOT be confined to your ""job"". We believe in nurturing employees’ interests and passions – even if some of them lie outside of your core responsibilities.
* You will NOT be bogged down by office politics, egos, or bad attitudes. Only positive, pleasure-to-work-with people are allowed here!
* You will NOT get burned out. We work hard, but we also believe in maintaining sustainable work/life balance. Seriously.
* You will NOT have to wonder why you’re doing the work you’re doing. Our day-to-day operations translate into people getting the help they need.

### **Can I work remotely?**


Yes. We operate in Pacific Time and candidates in any time zone are welcome to apply. We also ask our employees to travel to our Mountain View, CA office up to three times per year and to one company offsite to collaborate in person in order to build better working relationships and experience our in-office culture. Travel expenses will be covered and reasonable accommodations will be made for those under unique circumstances who cannot travel.

* 7+ years independently providing direct clinical care to individuals.
* Must be active and in good standing with your respective Clinical regulatory body and/or professional organization.

* Experience providing 1:1 therapy via telehealth.

**Stageopdracht | Hbo - Wo | SPECTO Aerospace | Amsterdam Lelystad Airport**

  

**""Het bouwen van een geavanceerd systeem waarin middels** Dynamic Augmented Reality technische informatie vanuit de echte wereld wordt toegevoegd aan een virtueel 3D vliegtuigonderdeel. **Die stap zetten we graag samen met jou!""**

  

Bij SPECTO Aerospace, een gecertificeerd luchtvaart-technisch bedrijf gevestigd op Lelystad-Airport en op de luchtmachtbasis in Woensdrecht, repareren we hoogwaardige composiet onderdelen voor de internationale luchtvaart- en defensie-industrie. Met een team van ongeveer 50 collega's werken we hard aan onze toekomst. Alles draait bij ons om vindingrijkheid, innovatie en kwaliteit en daarom zetten wij als onderhoudsbedrijf technologie-stappen die verder gaan dan de vereisten binnen de luchtvaartbranche. We zijn trots op ons vak en hebben allemaal hart voor de zaak. Samen gaan we voor het beste resultaat en helpen we elkaar waar nodig. Bij ons heerst een open en familiaire sfeer, waarbij onze kernwaardes gericht zijn op mensen.

  

**De Casus**



SPECTO is in feite een ambachtsbedrijf in een high-tech omgeving (www.spectoaerospace.com). Wij hebben ons ten doel gesteld om verregaand te digitaliseren. Niet omdat dat efficiënter is maar ook omdat ons dat gaat helpen om ‘het spel te veranderen’. In het reparatieproces van composiet vliegtuigonderdelen wordt standaard al een veelheid aan detailgegevens vastgelegd door specialisten en engineers en wij willen deze informatie in een 3D-omgeving gaan verwerken om hiermee in beelden te kunnen communiceren naar stakeholders (Visualization), om informatie tijdens het proces te ontsluiten en op te slaan (Digital Twinning) en om al deze data te kunnen analyseren om de volgende generatie vliegtuigonderdelen te kunnen ontwerpen (Data Analytics). Hiervoor willen wij onze schaal 1:1 3D-modellen gaan gebruiken die wij zelf met onze eigen geavanceerde scannerapparatuur maken van vliegtuigonderdelen

 **De Opdracht**

  

Wij hebben een Proof of Concept applicatie ontwikkeld waarin wij in staat zijn om vormen te tekenen op een 3D model en deze te linken aan onderliggende data. Deze applicatie is echter nog niet af: wij willen 3D kleur- en meetdata op een laagdrempelige manier kunnen opnemen vanuit de realiteit (fysieke omgeving) en deze vastleggen/overzetten als informatielaag op het 3D model in de virtuele omgeving. Voor deze opdracht is het een vereiste dat je sterke affiniteit dan wel ervaring hebt met werken met 3D technieken. Denk hierbij aan bijvoorbeeld fotogrammetrie technieken, Augmented Reality of UV-mapping.

 **Wat mag j****e verwachten van SPECTO**


* Een leeromgeving waarin we met je samenwerken en je echt onderdeel bent van het SPECTO Team!
* Flexibiliteit in werktijden en locaties
* Een marktconforme stagevergoeding
### **Vereisten**

**Wat verwachten we van jou als Stagiair?**

  


Jij bent een enthousiaste teamspeler die het leuk vindt om samen met ons op Lelystad Airport nieuwe oplossingen te bedenken, te onderzoeken, te bouwen én te testen. Je bent een creatieve denker en je hebt een passie voor nieuwe technologie en tools.

  

Verder vragen wij:


* Je volgt een studie in de richting Hbo ICT Software Engineering, Creative Media and Gaming Technologies of vergelijkbaar (3e of 4e jaar)
* Je bent bekend met onder meer Unity, C# en/of Java
* Werken met 3D modellen, fotogrammetrie en/of UV-mapping is een pré
* Je bent natuurlijk in staat om zelfstandig en gestructureerd te werken

**""Het bouwen van een geavanceerd systeem waarin middels** Dynamic Augmented Reality technische informatie vanuit de echte wereld wordt toegevoegd aan een virtueel 3D vliegtuigonderdeel. **Die stap zetten we graag samen met jou!""**

  

Bij SPECTO Aerospace, een gecertificeerd luchtvaart-technisch bedrijf gevestigd op Lelystad-Airport en op de luchtmachtbasis in Woensdrecht, repareren we hoogwaardige composiet onderdelen voor de internationale luchtvaart- en defensie-industrie. Met een team van ongeveer 50 collega's werken we hard aan onze toekomst. Alles draait bij ons om vindingrijkheid, innovatie en kwaliteit en daarom zetten wij als onderhoudsbedrijf technologie-stappen die verder gaan dan de vereisten binnen de luchtvaartbranche. We zijn trots op ons vak en hebben allemaal hart voor de zaak. Samen gaan we voor het beste resultaat en helpen we elkaar waar nodig. Bij ons heerst een open en familiaire sfeer, waarbij onze kernwaardes gericht zijn op mensen.

  

**De Casus**



SPECTO is in feite een ambachtsbedrijf in een high-tech omgeving (www.spectoaerospace.com). Wij hebben ons ten doel gesteld om verregaand te digitaliseren. Niet omdat dat efficiënter is maar ook omdat ons dat gaat helpen om ‘het spel te veranderen’. In het reparatieproces van composiet vliegtuigonderdelen wordt standaard al een veelheid aan detailgegevens vastgelegd door specialisten en engineers en wij willen deze informatie in een 3D-omgeving gaan verwerken om hiermee in beelden te kunnen communiceren naar stakeholders (Visualization), om informatie tijdens het proces te ontsluiten en op te slaan (Digital Twinning) en om al deze data te kunnen analyseren om de volgende generatie vliegtuigonderdelen te kunnen ontwerpen (Data Analytics). Hiervoor willen wij onze schaal 1:1 3D-modellen gaan gebruiken die wij zelf met onze eigen geavanceerde scannerapparatuur maken van vliegtuigonderdelen

 **De Opdracht**

  

Wij hebben een Proof of Concept applicatie ontwikkeld waarin wij in staat zijn om vormen te tekenen op een 3D model en deze te linken aan onderliggende data. Deze applicatie is echter nog niet af: wij willen 3D kleur- en meetdata op een laagdrempelige manier kunnen opnemen vanuit de realiteit (fysieke omgeving) en deze vastleggen/overzetten als informatielaag op het 3D model in de virtuele omgeving. Voor deze opdracht is het een vereiste dat je sterke affiniteit dan wel ervaring hebt met werken met 3D technieken. Denk hierbij aan bijvoorbeeld fotogrammetrie technieken, Augmented Reality of UV-mapping.

 **Wat mag j****e verwachten van SPECTO**


* Een leeromgeving waarin we met je samenwerken en je echt onderdeel bent van het SPECTO Team!
* Flexibiliteit in werktijden en locaties
* Een marktconforme stagevergoeding

 **Wat verwachten we van jou als Stagiair?**

  


Jij bent een enthousiaste teamspeler die het leuk vindt om samen met ons op Lelystad Airport nieuwe oplossingen te bedenken, te onderzoeken, te bouwen én te testen. Je bent een creatieve denker en je hebt een passie voor nieuwe technologie en tools.

  

Verder vragen wij:


* Je volgt een studie in de richting Hbo ICT Software Engineering, Creative Media and Gaming Technologies of vergelijkbaar (3e of 4e jaar)
* Je bent bekend met onder meer Unity, C# en/of Java
* Werken met 3D modellen, fotogrammetrie en/of UV-mapping is een pré

Investigate and improve data science model output delivery.
  

  

**Background**
  

  

Within ING we make use of data science for a variety of use cases (such as improving financial health of our customers by transaction forecasting). The data science models which run in production all generate output this data needs to be delivered to different destination within ING. These destinations vary from data lakes and kafka topics to Cassandra datastores.
  

  

In the past a generic Interface format (GI) was developed as a one size fits all solution to standardize the output delivery for our data-scientists. Over time many models have adopted this interface but we are now facing challenges such as files which became too big or the throughput time is too long.
  

  

**The opportunity**
  

  

We would like to deep-dive into this topic by dedicating an intern as engineer to investigate our use cases and look for a future proof solution. This includes gathering information, do market research (buy vs built) and design / develop one or more prototypes together with our data-scientists data engineers.
  

  

**Team** **overview**
  

  

You, as an intern will join one of our data-engineering teams which support the ING data-scientists. The teams work on a variety of topics to maintain and evolve our data-analytics environment in Google Cloud.
  

* Located in our Amsterdam office.
* Mix of local and off-shore colleagues (so multiple nationalities)
* We work in agile teams based around Scrum and continuous delivery principles.
* Our teams work in hybrid mode, we work from home when possible and work from the office at least one day a week.
* We have 36 hour working weeks.

  

**Roles and responsibilities**
  

  

This assignment is about understanding and improving our way of distributing data-science model output. The current implementation of GI (Generic Interface) needs to be examined as well as our use cases and the industry standards available. The goal is to boost new alternatives and bring us further in achieving an excellent data-driven organization.
  

  

**Expected l** **earnings**  

  

You will be working in an environment with modern continuous delivery tools with people who have a continuous improvement mindset. Tools include Azure (CDaaS), Google GCP (Terraform, Vertex AI, BigQuery), NiFi for data flow management.
  

  

Working in a complex environment such as ING can be challenging and this is part of the learning and our people and teams are there to help you.
  

  

Communication and collaboration are key and this involves working closely together with domain experts such as data-engineers, data-scientists and machine learning engineers.
  

  

**Expected output**
  

  

An inventory of required features, an improved understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the current implementation and a redesign plus implementation plan (part of this can also contain a buy vs built decision or a vendor selection).
  

  

When time allows the output also consists of the implementation of a prototype solution.
  

  

**How to succeed**
  

  

You can succeed in this role by showing:
  

* a ""can-do"" mentality
* you are a ""self starter"" (pro-active)
* you speak out and like to challenge yourself and the people around you
* you have a background in IT, information management or similar
* experience and affinity with machine learning is very useful
* it helps if you like programming (python, java, scala) though this is not a show stopper

  

**Rewards and benefits**
  

This is a great opportunity to train with highly skilled people who are experts in their field. You'll do a lot and learn a lot -
  

not only about your specialist area and the bank, but also about yourself and whether this type of environment is right for you.
  

  

You'll also benefit from:
  

* Internship allowance of EUR 700/month for 36 hours (maximum)
* Compensation of travel costs
* Your own work laptop
* Hybrid working to blend home working for focus and office working for collaboration and co-creation
* Personal growth and challenging work with endless possibilities
* An informal working environment with innovative colleagues

  

**About our internships**
  

Every year, more than 350 students join our internship program. While there are no guarantees about your future, many of our
  

former interns move into a permanent role or onto our International Talent Programme (traineeship).
  

Whatever happens, an internship at ING is the ideal opportunity to meet a wide variety of people, to build up your own network,
  

and to learn about many different aspects of banking - put simply, it's a great start to your career.

De overgang naar duurzame en betrouwbare energievoorziening brengt flinke uitdagingen met zich mee. Dat vraagt om slimmer werken en nieuwe oplossingen. Daarom heeft Alliander in haar operationele afdelingen veranderteams zitten die samen met de business deze noodzakelijke veranderingen mogelijk maken.


Jij gaat aan de slag binnen en het team ProjectPuzzler. Het ProjectPuzzler team ontwikkelt en beheert een optimizer tool voor de planning van monteurs op projecten voor de realisatieketens, zoals GVR&N, Onderhoud & Storingen, en de resourceplanning van Strategische Resource Management. Via deze tool werkt het team nauw samen met het operationele team in (planners en projectmanagers) om de voorbereidingsfase (3-24 weken tot uitvoer) van de planning uit te voeren. Ons doel is om voldoende, waardevoller en planbaar werk naar de uitvoering te brengen.


Samen met BCG hebben we de Proof of Concept (PoC) fase afgerond en het project is op dit moment in de MVP-fase. Het team is nu opgesplitst in een business- en een development team, vanwege het grote aantal betrokken analisten, data scientists en data engineers. Jouw rol is om ervoor te zorgen dat beide teams goed op elkaar zijn afgestemd. Samen met de scrum master zorg je ervoor dat het team na deze fase samensmelt tot één scrum team, waar jij de Product Owner van wordt.


Het energienet van de toekomst maken we voor iedereen, mét iedereen . En als Product Owner werk jij hieraan mee. Zo ben jij bezig met het:

* ontwikkelen van een visie en deze samen met het team omzetten in acties met als doel kort-cyclisch zoveel mogelijk waarde te realiseren.
* prioriteren van de backlog met als doel focus aan te brengen in een overzichtelijke roadmap van het ontwikkelteam.
* het bedenken en uitvoeren van de juiste implementatiestrategie; enthousiasmeren en inspireren van het ontwikkelteam en stakeholders.
* uitdragen van de AGILE werkwijze om in samenwerking met je scrummaster een zelfsturend team neer te zetten.
* afstemmen met andere Product Owners van andere teams om zo afhankelijkheden tussen teams beheersbaar te maken.

**Jij maakt het net completer bij Alliander**

Wist je dat we bij Alliander uit verschillende bedrijven bestaan? Samen met Liander, Qirion, Qterra, Dep, Firan en Entrnce ontwikkelen én beheren we het energienet voor miljoenen inwoners van Nederland. En met de huidige energietransitie is dat hard werken. Dat doen we met de hulp van ruim 8.000 vakmensen. Dankzij deze talenten hebben wij het volste vertrouwen in de energietoekomst van Nederland. Samen met jou maken wij dat mogelijk.


Een mindset waarin alleen het beste goed genoeg is, kan alleen als jij genoeg energie hebt. En de juiste werkomgeving geeft jou dat. Als Product Owner werk je vanuit één van de veranderteams binnen Grootverbruik, Grote Werkpakketten, Kleinverbruik, Onderhoud & Storingen of Strategisch Resource Management. Daar werk je aan mooie verbeterprojecten met betrokken & eerlijke collega’s!

**Jij maakt het net energieker**


Werken aan een organisatie die toekomstproof is. Dat doe je vanuit je eigen kracht en talent. En dat doe je bij ons. Draag jij daaraan bij met jouw flexibiliteit in een veranderende omgeving? Super! Zeker als je dit aanvult met:

* een aantal jaren ervaring als Product Owner binnen een complexe en uitdagende omgeving
* WO werk- en denkniveau;
* ervaring met advanced analytics tools/ it-producten;
* minimaal 5 jaar ervaring met SAFe of Scrum; certificering als Product Owner is een sterke pré.
* affiniteit met de energiewereld en data-sience.

**Voor jou net beter geregeld**


Daarvoor krijg jij op basis van een 38-urige werkweek:

* een salaris van € 4.955,- tot € 6.800,- bruto per maand.
* jaarlijks een individueel keuze budget (IKB) van 18% (fulltime) of 12,8% (parttime) van je bruto jaarsalaris. Dit is inclusief 8% vakantietoeslag. Je kunt dit bedrag uit laten betalen, maar je kunt er bijvoorbeeld ook extra vrije dagen voor kopen. Jij kiest wat bij jou past.
* een eindejaarsuitkering in december van 6% van de uitbetaalde maandsalarissen in het huidige kalenderjaar.
* een pensioenopbouw bij ABP, speciaal voor de overheid en het onderwijs. Wij betalen 70% van jouw pensioenpremie.
* werken waar dit voor jou het beste werkt, als je functie dit toelaat. Vanaf kantoor of vanuit eigen huis. Werk je vanuit huis, dan ontvang je hiervoor een thuiswerktegemoetkoming.


Natuurlijk hebben we nog veel meer! Lees meer over al jouw arbeidsvoorwaarden.

The forecasting team consists of a product owner, scrum master and 6 model builders. The team is international, diverse and daily language is English. You will be part of a warm and professional team where hard working and fun is combined.

---------------------------------------



Waar staat de LFI voor?



De Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) is een nieuw organisatieonderdeel van het RIVM. Het is de missie van de LFI om samen met haar ketenpartners de impact van de volgende pandemie op de volksgezondheid zo klein mogelijk te houden. Bij een infectieziektecrisis die een landelijke aanpak vereist, zorgt de LFI voor snelle opschaling en centrale aansturing van de medisch-operationele processen bij de GGD’en, zoals testen en vaccineren.



Om samen met de ketenpartners goed voorbereid te zijn, voert de LFI regie op onder andere het opleiden, trainen en oefenen van medewerkers en het maken van afspraken over informatievoorziening en snelle beschikbaarheid van grote aantallen medewerkers. Door de sterke verbinding met de GGD’en en het Centrum Infectieziektebestrijding (CIb) van het RIVM, kan de LFI snel opschalen bij een infectieziektecrisis.



De implementatie van de LFI is eind 2023 gestart en is naar verwachting eind 2026 voltooid. In deze periode geeft de LFI samen met GGD’en, andere onderdelen van het RIVM en het ministerie van VWS concrete invulling aan de ontwerpen voor onder andere aansturing, opgeschaalde diagnostiek en behandelen, grootschalig klantcontact, logistiek, scenario-ontwerp, crisiscommunicatie, informatiemanagement, inkoop, facilitaire diensten en financiën.

Are you a creative and independent thinker and passionate about analytic philosophy of science? Are you interested in exploring how social scientists uncover causes and effects in the social world? And do you hold (or are close to obtaining) a Master's in Philosophy or a related field? If so, apply as a PhD candidate!
  
  

In this PhD project, you will critically study causal mechanisms in the social sciences. The project is suitable for a candidate with a strong background in philosophy of science and a proven interest or experience in social scientific research (such as political science, international relations studies, sociology, or educational research). You will be able to shape the project in a way that matches your interests and background.
  
  

Why did the Hungarian democracy backslide? Why do some women perform worse on standardised math tests? Increasingly, social scientists frame questions like these as queries about causal mechanisms. Thus, political scientists claim that ‘polarisation’ is a causal mechanism undermining the Hungarian democracy, and sociologists claim that ‘stereotype threat’ is a causal mechanism behind the worse performance of some women on standardised math tests. While social scientists cannot formulate exceptionless laws that tell them when democratic backsliding or poor academic performance will occur, many believe they can explain and/or predict instances of these phenomena by discovering case-specific mechanisms. These mechanisms, they argue, can open the ’black box’ of correlational research by showing how a putative cause led to an effect of interest. But how and in what sense can one speak sensibly about causal mechanisms in the heterogeneous, ever evolving, complex social world?
  
  

You will participate in relevant conferences, workshops and seminars, and communicate your findings through publications in proceedings and peer-reviewed journals. In addition to your research, you will have a standard 10% teaching load to help you develop your teaching skills and further qualify for a career as an independent academic researcher. You will also have the opportunity to further develop your skill set by attending courses that are relevant for your project and general development.
  
  

This PhD project will be funded by a starter grant awarded by the Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies to Dr Rosa W. Runhardt, Assistant Professor of Philosophy of Science, specialist in causal inference and measurement in the social sciences. In this project, Dr Runhardt will also be your daily supervisor. Furthermore, Dr Harmen Ghijsen will be your secondary supervisor and Prof. Marc Slors will be your PhD supervisor (promotor).
  
  

Profile
  
You hold or are about to obtain a Master's degree in Philosophy or a field related to the project.

How does the medieval body of texts known as 'canon law' reflect social and moral ideas? With a combination of AI and an advanced dataset, can we reveal patterns in the transmission and alteration of these ideas over time? Join the SOLEMNE project as a research assistant to explore these questions and more.
  
  

The medieval body of texts known as 'canon law' not only regulates strictly religious or ecclesiastical issues but also communicates social and moral ideas about the inner life of society. With an advanced dataset and novel AI techniques, it is possible to chart how such ideas are transmitted, appropriated, altered, and promoted in canonical collections. As a research assistant you will contribute to this study by expanding its data entry and training AI models.
  
  

This one-year position is part of the project 'The Social Life of Early Medieval Normative Texts' (SOLEMNE), funded through an ERC Consolidator Grant awarded to Dr Sven Meeder. A fuller description of the project can be found here. The SOLEMNE project aims to describe and contextualise the spread of social norms as articulated through specific combinations of canons in a bottom-up approach starting from the vast corpus of manuscript witnesses of canonical collections in every shape and form (4th-12th centuries). A dynamic dataset forms an essential element of the project, combined with an innovative digital tool that allows for queries of shared content in canonical collections or manuscripts and of levels of affinity based on combinations of authoritative statements.
  
  

In close collaboration with the project's postdoctoral researcher, associated data scientists, and development team, you will (i) contribute to the design of the database to store the information regarding original medieval manuscripts preserving individual canons and entire canonical collections, and scholarly editions of these texts, (ii) play a key role in training handwritten text recognition (HTR) models using eScriptorium software as well as AI-driven models for correction and normalisation of the transcription, (iii) populate the database with the data gathered from the original documents and printed reference works, (iv) contribute to the wider communication of the project's results, including materials intended for a general audience, and (v) cooperate closely with all of SOLEMNE’s subprojects.
  
  

Profile
  
You should hold an RMA, MA or MPhil degree in Late Antique, Medieval or Legal History (if the degree has not yet been obtained at the time of application, a statement by your supervisor should confirm that it will be obtained by the time of appointment).
  
You possess well-developed research skills, clear descriptive and analytical abilities, and some experience with palaeography and manuscript studies.
  
You have an affinity with Digital Humanities and a willingness to acquire or expand your digital skillset. Experience in working with unstructured or structured data (XML, JSON) and in managing databases will be an advantage.

Would you like to contribute to understanding the impact of climate change on nutrient dynamics in high-latitude marine environments? Do you thrive in the dynamic blend of fieldwork adventures, laboratory experiments and geochemical modelling? As a PhD Candidate, you will explore the impact of climatic changes on nutrient dynamics in high-latitude regions and the role they play in the growth of phytoplankton in marine environments.
  
  

High-latitude oceans are rapidly changing due to human-induced climate change. Variations in the environment can strongly alter the dynamics of key nutrients such as iron and manganese, which can limit primary productivity in surface waters. The sea floor is a key source of iron and manganese to the ocean. In this project we aim to determine how iron and manganese are currently released from sediments and transported to offshore waters where they can impact phytoplankton growth and how this will change in the future.
  
  

The project focuses on samples that were collected around East Antarctica and Svalbard this year. These two locations contrast in terms of the impact of climate change. Where the impact of human-induced climate change around East Antarctica is limited, Svalbard is already heavily impacted. Your work will be to determine current iron and manganese dynamics at these two locations by conducting laboratory work and geochemical modelling. Additional fieldwork is expected. The ultimate goal of the project is to implement the findings in a state-of-the-art global model to determine how iron and manganese dynamics will change in the future upon continued climatic changes.

The goal of this PhD project is to develop, build and operate a vacuum compatible exfoliation center for the creation of heterostructures constructed from reactive 2D materials.
  
  

Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials, e.g. graphene, have gained much attention in research for their special physical properties compared to their three-dimensional counterparts. Halides or transition metal dichalcogenides in particular, but also many other material compounds, show great potential for future device applications because of their special superconducting, magnetic or transport properties. However, typically these materials are very reactive and deteriorate quickly under ambient conditions or even in the dry atmosphere of a glove box.
  
  

Your goal will be to establish a new synthesis method and subsequently investigate these materials using local probes at ultra-low temperatures, including scanning probe microscopy and magneto-transport. Using these newly developed material systems, you will investigate physical phenomena such as superconductivity, charge transport, and unconventional memory/computing. Your teaching load may be up to 10% of your working time.
  
  

Our Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) group has long-standing expertise in developing very specialised and world-class scientific instruments [1]. Furthermore, we have successfully explored the surface properties of bulk black phosphorus [2] and demonstrated its potential as a platform for orbital memory [3] and even brain-inspired computing [4]. The next natural step is to investigate materials mentioned above in their 2D limit [5].

Are you a creative and independant thinker who is passioned about German Philosophy? Are you interested in anthropological theories of the late 18th and early 19th centuries? And do you hold a Master's degree in Philosophy, or are you close to obtaining such a degree? If so, we encourage you to apply as a PhD candidate.
  
  

The Department of Metaphysics and Philosophical Anthropology is looking for a PhD candidate to work on the project ’The Origins of Philosophical Anthropology in Classical German Philosophy’. In the eighteenth century, the study of human nature and the development of anthropological theories gained increasing attention. Classical German philosophers played a central role in establishing philosophical anthropology as a proper academic discipline. Kant’s lectures on anthropology, delivered at the University of Königsberg from 1772 to 1796, and his book Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht (1798) were pivotal in this development. Kant’s work sparked a growing interest in anthropological topics, and his influence can be observed in major representatives of classical German philosophy (from Herder to Hegel) and in other post-Kantian philosophers who contributed to the anthropological debates of the time (such as Carl Leonhard Reinhold, Carl Christian Erhard Schmid, and Jakob Friedrich Fries). Additionally, philosophical approaches were shaped by both the positive and critical reception of contemporaneous scientific anthropologies developed by physicians and life scientists like Johann Friedrich Blumenbach and Ernst Platner. Recent scholarship on classical German philosophy has demonstrated a growing interest in anthropological topics, especially with regard to Kant’s anthropology. However, less attention has been paid to the anthropological accounts of other post-Kantian philosophers and to the influence of empirical research on philosophical theories.
  
  

As a PhD candidate, you will conduct research on anthropological theories of one or more authors of classical German philosophy. This may involve focusing on the main proponents (such as Kant, Herder, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel) or expanding the scope of research to include lesser-known or overlooked authors. You will be asked to submit a short research proposal outlining your proposed topic and author(s), and explaining how your proposed research will fit into the project on the origins of philosophical anthropology in classical German philosophy.
  
  

Your teaching load will be up to 10% of your working time.
  
  

Profile
  
You hold an MA degree in Philosophy. You have a good knowledge of Classical German Philosophy. Familiarity with the project’s subject area is desired.
  
You are able to conduct independent research and work in a collaborative research environment.

You have excellent reading skills in German.

Progress in cancer biology is hampered by the difficulty to grow them in a realistic environment. The best models currently available are 3D tumour organoids. They are typically grown in animal-derived basement membrane extracts, which suffer from lot-to-lot variability and have a heterogeneous and complex composition, which makes it virtually impossible to systematically map parameters that affect tumour growth or treatment efficacy. To increase our collective knowledge on cancer biology and therapies, improved matrices are urgently needed. This project uses a synthetic biomimetic extracellular matrix, based on synthetic polyisocyanides (PICs). It is animal-free, cost-effective and easy to use.
  
  

The ultimate goal is to establish a novel organoid platform for in vitro cancer modelling, personalised medicine and biobanking of patient-derived organoids for drug screenings or toxicology assays. As a proof of concept in this KWF-funded project, we aim to establish a PIC-based head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) ORGAnoid maTRIX platform, called ORGATRIX.
  
  

This project is a close collaboration between Dr Paul Kouwer's group at Radboud University and Dr Marleen Ansems' group at the Radboud university medical center. As a postdoctoral researcher working on this project, you will be expected to work in both labs, which are conveniently located across the street from each other.
  
  

In the Kouwer Lab, you will prepare and modify PIC gels using protocols optimised for scientists without a strong materials chemistry background. Organoid cultures will be grown in these different PIC gels in the Ansems Lab. The team will hold biweekly meetings to exchange information, monitor progress and prioritise tasks.
  
  

A technician will be available to provide support in the cell biology experiments.
  
  

Profile
  
You should hold a PhD degree in Cell Biology, Chemistry, Biomaterials, or Immunology.
  
You have experience with cell culture.
  
You have a proven affinity for biomaterials and chemistry.
  
You have good collaborative skills.
  
You are pro-active.
  
You have a good command of spoken and written English.
  
We are
  
  

The Kouwer Lab specialises in the design, preparation and use of soft materials. Our core business is to make hydrogels with biomedical applications. The group consists of chemists who make new materials and new features in existing hydrogels, and cell biologists who use the gels in their experiments. The group is part of the larger Department of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, wherein a number of PIs collaborate and share facilities.
  
  

The Ansems Lab is embedded in the Radiotherapy & OncoImmunology (ROI) laboratory at the Department of Radiation Oncology of the Radboud university medical center. The group focuses on understanding molecular and cellular interactions in the tumour microenvironment, aiming to translate our findings into optimal treatment strategies. To achieve this, we utilise a combination of organoid models, preclinical mouse models and human primary tumour tissue.
  
  

You will be encouraged to actively participate in networking opportunities at the Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences and the Radboudumc Research Institute for Medical Innovation.

Wij maken van Albert Heijn het beste omnichannel Food & Tech bedrijf en willen digitaal gemak voor iedereen. We testen en experimenteren, zijn innovatief en verleggen grenzen. Voor die reis hebben wij het Data Talent Track. Een track waarin wij jouw carrière als Data Analyst bij Albert Heijn een vliegende start geven binnen onze Digital Analytics afdeling. Is dit echt iets voor jou? Word dan de nieuwe Data Analyst in ons Data Talent Track!

  

  

**Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst ken jij onze klant het beste. Deze kennis verkrijg je door gebruik te maken van data (zoals bijvoorbeeld data over koopgedrag), om zo de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van data-oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk met de nieuwste data analytics technieken. Je maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Analytics & Data Science team, en bent daarmee onderdeel van de grotere Analytics community binnen Albert Heijn. Je beweegt makkelijk tussen Tech, Data Science en de business teams, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data analytics toepassingen. Je maakt impact als Data Analist door:

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

  



**Dit doe je als Data Analyst Digital**

Het Digital domein richt zich op digitale relevantie, experimentation, eCommerce en klantloyaliteit. Hiervoor voeren we data-analyses uit of ontwikkelen wij dataproducten om onze e-commerce en Digital-afdelingen te ondersteunen met inzichten rondom onze klanten, het verbeteren van e-commerce en het verbeteren van de customer journey. Denk daarbij aan projecten zoals het relevanter maken van onze aanbiedingen (Mijn Bonus Box) of marketing, inzichtelijk maken van de omnichannel customer journeys en het analyseren van onze spaarprogramma’s.

  



**Jouw ontwikkeling in het Data Talent Track**


Het Data Talent Track is een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen die je helpen om jouw professionele vaardigheden te ontwikkelen. Zo zijn er trainingen zoals persoonlijk leiderschap en het efficiënter schrijven van code, maar ga je bijvoorbeeld ook een dagje meehelpen in de winkel of bouw je mee aan de ideeën van de toekomst in een Hackathon. Wil je meer weten over hoe het Data Talent Track eruitziet? Neem dan vooral ook eens een kijkje hier.

 **De beste ingrediënten voor een betekenisvolle baan**

* Een salaris van max € 4000,- per periode van 4 weken (afhankelijk van je ervaring)

Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)
* Python en SQL

**Fijne pre's:**

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

**Stageopdracht | Hbo - Wo | SPECTO Aerospace | Amsterdam Lelystad Airport**

  

**""Het bouwen van een geavanceerd systeem waarin middels** Dynamic Augmented Reality technische informatie vanuit de echte wereld wordt toegevoegd aan een virtueel 3D vliegtuigonderdeel. **Die stap zetten we graag samen met jou!""**

  

Bij SPECTO Aerospace, een gecertificeerd luchtvaart-technisch bedrijf gevestigd op Lelystad-Airport en op de luchtmachtbasis in Woensdrecht, repareren we hoogwaardige composiet onderdelen voor de internationale luchtvaart- en defensie-industrie. Met een team van ongeveer 50 collega's werken we hard aan onze toekomst. Alles draait bij ons om vindingrijkheid, innovatie en kwaliteit en daarom zetten wij als onderhoudsbedrijf technologie-stappen die verder gaan dan de vereisten binnen de luchtvaartbranche. We zijn trots op ons vak en hebben allemaal hart voor de zaak. Samen gaan we voor het beste resultaat en helpen we elkaar waar nodig. Bij ons heerst een open en familiaire sfeer, waarbij onze kernwaardes gericht zijn op mensen.

  

**De Casus**



SPECTO is in feite een ambachtsbedrijf in een high-tech omgeving (www.spectoaerospace.com). Wij hebben ons ten doel gesteld om verregaand te digitaliseren. Niet omdat dat efficiënter is maar ook omdat ons dat gaat helpen om ‘het spel te veranderen’. In het reparatieproces van composiet vliegtuigonderdelen wordt standaard al een veelheid aan detailgegevens vastgelegd door specialisten en engineers en wij willen deze informatie in een 3D-omgeving gaan verwerken om hiermee in beelden te kunnen communiceren naar stakeholders (Visualization), om informatie tijdens het proces te ontsluiten en op te slaan (Digital Twinning) en om al deze data te kunnen analyseren om de volgende generatie vliegtuigonderdelen te kunnen ontwerpen (Data Analytics). Hiervoor willen wij onze schaal 1:1 3D-modellen gaan gebruiken die wij zelf met onze eigen geavanceerde scannerapparatuur maken van vliegtuigonderdelen

 **De Opdracht**

  

Wij hebben een Proof of Concept applicatie ontwikkeld waarin wij in staat zijn om vormen te tekenen op een 3D model en deze te linken aan onderliggende data. Deze applicatie is echter nog niet af: wij willen 3D kleur- en meetdata op een laagdrempelige manier kunnen opnemen vanuit de realiteit (fysieke omgeving) en deze vastleggen/overzetten als informatielaag op het 3D model in de virtuele omgeving. Voor deze opdracht is het een vereiste dat je sterke affiniteit dan wel ervaring hebt met werken met 3D technieken. Denk hierbij aan bijvoorbeeld fotogrammetrie technieken, Augmented Reality of UV-mapping.

 **Wat mag j****e verwachten van SPECTO**


* Een leeromgeving waarin we met je samenwerken en je echt onderdeel bent van het SPECTO Team!
* Flexibiliteit in werktijden en locaties
* Een marktconforme stagevergoeding
### **Vereisten**

**Wat verwachten we van jou als Stagiair?**

  


Jij bent een enthousiaste teamspeler die het leuk vindt om samen met ons op Lelystad Airport nieuwe oplossingen te bedenken, te onderzoeken, te bouwen én te testen. Je bent een creatieve denker en je hebt een passie voor nieuwe technologie en tools.

  

Verder vragen wij:


* Je volgt een studie in de richting Hbo ICT Software Engineering, Creative Media and Gaming Technologies of vergelijkbaar (3e of 4e jaar)
* Je bent bekend met onder meer Unity, C# en/of Java
* Werken met 3D modellen, fotogrammetrie en/of UV-mapping is een pré
* Je bent natuurlijk in staat om zelfstandig en gestructureerd te werken

-------------------


The Department of Industrial Design of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), in cooperation with Philips Clinical Informatics is offering two fully funded 2-year positions to master graduates leading to the award of an EngD (Engineering Doctorate) degree in Designing Human-System Interaction.


**Societal urgency**


Access to high quality healthcare is under increasing pressure. Patient volumes are rising due to an aging population, and the amount of data from scans and image interpretation is increasing at a steeper pace than radiologists and pathologists can handle. Radiology leaders have raised alarm that labor shortages are leading to longer wait times and delays in treatment for patients. Never has there been a bigger need to relieve the pressure from staff. But how exactly do we make that happen?


**The challenge**


Adoption of radiology and pathology solutions is increasingly driven by the extent to which solutions “naturally” fit into clinical workflows and enable radiologists and pathologists to deliver quality at speed. This requires not only high-quality medical data and cutting-edge AI models. More so, clinical acceptance and adoption depends on solutions that are designed with a clear understanding of clinical workflows and usage patterns, and with the requirements that different clinical experts have on their tooling. Beyond functional requirements, successful clinical adoption needs highly intuitive solutions, seamless workflow integration (speed), and a great user experience. In sum, we face the overarching challenge of how to integrate AI-based clinical decision-making tools into clinical practice that is characterized by fast-paced, high-stakes decision-making informed by deep domain knowledge and year-long expertise.


Prototypes that are highly realistic in the eyes of the clinical user have shown to be an important “vehicle” to enable rapid co-creation with clinicians. It enables them to give meaningful clinician-centered direction to development complex technical tools. Are you ready to iteratively create such prototypes and shape them together with experts in the field?


**You are part of a learning community**


You will be strongly embedded in and work closely with a highly dynamic community with experts from different disciplines including designers, researchers, engineers, clinical specialists and business:


* You will work “in-tandem” with your fellow EngD team member. You learn from each other by bouncing-off ideas and taking turns at different steps in the design process.
* You will immerse yourself in the Philips Clinical Informatics business context working closely with the design teams on the latest technology developments in radiology and digital pathology, in close collaboration with hospitals and clinical end-users where the impact is made.
* The EngD program offers a personalized learning experience through a mix of courses, coaching and hands-on learning by doing.
* You will be surrounded by a team of fellow EngDs and PhDs that focus on human-AI collaboration in the healthcare domain.


**The two positions**


**EngD position 1 – The medical data visualization & AI designer**

**""Het bouwen van een geavanceerd systeem waarin middels** Dynamic Augmented Reality technische informatie vanuit de echte wereld wordt toegevoegd aan een virtueel 3D vliegtuigonderdeel. **Die stap zetten we graag samen met jou!""**

  

Bij SPECTO Aerospace, een gecertificeerd luchtvaart-technisch bedrijf gevestigd op Lelystad-Airport en op de luchtmachtbasis in Woensdrecht, repareren we hoogwaardige composiet onderdelen voor de internationale luchtvaart- en defensie-industrie. Met een team van ongeveer 50 collega's werken we hard aan onze toekomst. Alles draait bij ons om vindingrijkheid, innovatie en kwaliteit en daarom zetten wij als onderhoudsbedrijf technologie-stappen die verder gaan dan de vereisten binnen de luchtvaartbranche. We zijn trots op ons vak en hebben allemaal hart voor de zaak. Samen gaan we voor het beste resultaat en helpen we elkaar waar nodig. Bij ons heerst een open en familiaire sfeer, waarbij onze kernwaardes gericht zijn op mensen.

  

**De Casus**



SPECTO is in feite een ambachtsbedrijf in een high-tech omgeving (www.spectoaerospace.com). Wij hebben ons ten doel gesteld om verregaand te digitaliseren. Niet omdat dat efficiënter is maar ook omdat ons dat gaat helpen om ‘het spel te veranderen’. In het reparatieproces van composiet vliegtuigonderdelen wordt standaard al een veelheid aan detailgegevens vastgelegd door specialisten en engineers en wij willen deze informatie in een 3D-omgeving gaan verwerken om hiermee in beelden te kunnen communiceren naar stakeholders (Visualization), om informatie tijdens het proces te ontsluiten en op te slaan (Digital Twinning) en om al deze data te kunnen analyseren om de volgende generatie vliegtuigonderdelen te kunnen ontwerpen (Data Analytics). Hiervoor willen wij onze schaal 1:1 3D-modellen gaan gebruiken die wij zelf met onze eigen geavanceerde scannerapparatuur maken van vliegtuigonderdelen

 **De Opdracht**

  

Wij hebben een Proof of Concept applicatie ontwikkeld waarin wij in staat zijn om vormen te tekenen op een 3D model en deze te linken aan onderliggende data. Deze applicatie is echter nog niet af: wij willen 3D kleur- en meetdata op een laagdrempelige manier kunnen opnemen vanuit de realiteit (fysieke omgeving) en deze vastleggen/overzetten als informatielaag op het 3D model in de virtuele omgeving. Voor deze opdracht is het een vereiste dat je sterke affiniteit dan wel ervaring hebt met werken met 3D technieken. Denk hierbij aan bijvoorbeeld fotogrammetrie technieken, Augmented Reality of UV-mapping.

 **Wat mag j****e verwachten van SPECTO**


* Een leeromgeving waarin we met je samenwerken en je echt onderdeel bent van het SPECTO Team!
* Flexibiliteit in werktijden en locaties
* Een marktconforme stagevergoeding

 **Wat verwachten we van jou als Stagiair?**

  


Jij bent een enthousiaste teamspeler die het leuk vindt om samen met ons op Lelystad Airport nieuwe oplossingen te bedenken, te onderzoeken, te bouwen én te testen. Je bent een creatieve denker en je hebt een passie voor nieuwe technologie en tools.

  

Verder vragen wij:


* Je volgt een studie in de richting Hbo ICT Software Engineering, Creative Media and Gaming Technologies of vergelijkbaar (3e of 4e jaar)
* Je bent bekend met onder meer Unity, C# en/of Java
* Werken met 3D modellen, fotogrammetrie en/of UV-mapping is een pré
* Je bent natuurlijk in staat om zelfstandig en gestructureerd te werken

**Who we are:**  

The Rainforest Alliance is creating a more sustainable world by using social and market forces to protect nature and improve the lives of farmers and forest communities. To achieve our mission, we partner with diverse allies around the world to drive positive change across global supply chains and in many of our most critically important natural landscapes.  

  

Our alliance spans 70 countries and includes farmers and forest communities, companies, governments, civil society, and millions of individuals. Together we work to protect forests and biodiversity, take action on climate, and promote the rights and improve the livelihoods of rural people.  

  

As an international nonprofit organization with more than 30 years of experience in sustainability transformation, we understand that the social and economic well-being of rural communities is tightly connected to ecosystem health. This knowledge has shaped our rigorous programs to advance sustainable land-use and commodity production.  

  

At the Rainforest Alliance we combat climate change, protect forests and biodiversity, promote human rights, and improve livelihoods. The enormity of the social and environmental challenges we are facing requires working together in a broad alliance. This is why we bring farmers, forest communities, companies, and consumers together to change the way the world produces, sources, and consumes.  

  

**Why**  

To protect nature and improve lives it’s becoming increasingly urgent that we approach the way we use our land and produce food and other products in more sustainable ways. For this to succeed we need to fundamentally change the way that businesses operate and source, and the choices we all make as consumers.  

  

**How**

----------------


Are you a bachelor student within a technical study, such as Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, and are you looking for an apprentice internship? Do you enjoy programming? Are you skilled in MATLAB or Python? Would you like to apply your theoretical knowledge in a real world setting and gain some practical experience? Then this internship might be interesting to you!

**Background information**
--------------------------


The Metrology Leveling department is part of the Development and Engineering sector of ASML. Our primary focus is on measuring each silicon wafer prior to exposure inside the Twinscan, generating a surface map with nanometer precision. In addition, we also play a role in the calibration of the Twinscan itself and maintain the control of the ""measure sequence"", which includes both our measurements and those from other departments, such as Horizontal Alignment. Stage alignment (SA) is the functionality that is used to determine the position (and shape) of plates of the wafer stage with respect to the metro frame. These plates are used as a reference for other measurements - both on measure and on expose side. Which plate or plates are measured, on which plate reticle alignment is done and the type of measure sequence (Production, Robust, etc.) differs per platform.

**Your assignment**
-------------------


With the introduction of a new Stage Alignment sequence in software, we also need to update the diagnostics tool used to analyze and visualize data from the machine. One of the biggest diagnostics tools, FlatNG, needs to be updated to handle the analysis and visualization of data from this new sequence. This will allow customers to help troubleshoot their systems themselves or with the help of the local office. Therefore, this assignment consists of adding this new functionality to the diagnostics tool. Additionally, some other tasks may include fixing bugs in the tool or even attempting to link the measure sequence and stage alignment sequence tooling dashboards.

**Your profile**
----------------


To be a match for this internship, you:

* Are busy with your bachelor's in Physics, Mathematics, Software, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering, or in a related technical study;
* Are skilled in MATLAB and/or Python;
* Are solution oriented and have a hands-on mentality;
* Have logical reasoning and a proactive mindset;
* Have good communication skills in English (verbal and written).


This is an apprentice internship for 4-5 days a week (3 days onsite) with a duration of 3 to 6 months. The start date is as soon as possible, October 2024.

**Please note that we can only consider students who are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship.**

**The program**

**Assistance and Advisory Service (AAS)**



The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) is NATO's principal C3 capability deliverer and CIS service provider. It provides, maintains and defends the NATO enterprise-wide information technology infrastructure to enable Allies to consult together under Article IV, and, when required, stand together in the face of attack under Article V.



To provide these critical services, in the modern evolving dynamic environment the NCI Agency needs to build and maintain high performance-engaged workforce. The NCI Agency workforce strategically consists of three major categorise's: NATO International Civilians (NIC)'s, Military (Mil), and Interim Workforce Consultants (IWC)'s. The IWCs are a critical part of the overall NCI Agency workforce and make up approximately 15 percent of the total workforce.



**Role Background**



The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) located in The Hague, Netherlands, is currently involved in the development and support of new and existing capabilities for NATO.



In light of these activities and in response to the NATO Overarching Space Policy as well as the declaration of Space as an Operational Domain, NATO has organised itself to keep pace with the evolving needs of the Alliance.



Within NCIA Chief Technology Office, the Space Technology Adoption and Resilience (STAR) team, will enable the exploitation of Space technology for NATO's defence and deterrence, ensuring NATO's technological edge for secure, resilient and effective employment of Space technologies for the Alliance.



STAR will develop and execute a technology strategy and associated roadmap for Space (CTO) and coordinate Space business delivery from within the NCIA Business Areas (COO). The STAR Team will provide technical expertise and strategic advice on Space for the benefit of the Alliance, design Space-based future services and foster their resilient integration into MultiDomain Operations (MDO). In line with strategic guidance and Space policy, the new STAR Team will provide the Alliance with technical expertise and strategic advice on Space, ensuring NCIA continues to provide applicable products, services and operational capability, taking resiliency from inception in line with the new NATO Strategic Concept.

Je gaat werken als journalist/redacteur voor **Assurantie Magazine (AM),** het grootste onafhankelijke nieuwsplatform voor financieel dienstverleners. Van verzekeraar tot hypotheekverstrekker en van schadebehandelaar tot pensioenadviseur; AM is al ruim 40 jaar de go-to nieuwsbron voor de verzekeringsbranche. Het is een competitieve, dynamische wereld vol botsende belangen, maar ook een branche met talloze mooie innovaties en maatschappelijke uitdagingen, zoals: hoe verzekeren we de energietransitie, en de steeds grotere cybercrime dreiging?


In deze rol:


* Draag jij met je spraakmakende, diepgravende artikelen en scoops bij aan structurele groei van het aantal betalende abonnees.
* Werk je voor AMweb.nl, waarmee je focus op digitale media ligt en je mede op basis van data je vervolgstappen bepaalt.
* Ben je binnen de redactie owner van je eigen dossiers die vallen onder belangrijke thema’s voor de verzekeringsbranche.
* Ben je als journalist actief betrokken bij de sector. Je kent onze doelgroep door en door, en je onderhoudt je netwerk goed.

We zijn een divers team van ervaren redacteuren, werkstudenten, event organisatoren en sales collega’s. De redactie van vijf redacteuren werkt aan eigen dossiers binnen thema’s zoals Schade, Hypotheken en het Intermediair, maar is ook nauw betrokken bij de AM Top 100 en ons jaarlijkse grote event voor de branche: AMdag.



Onze redactie ontmoet elkaar een vaste dag per week op kantoor, dan hebben we met elkaar ook de wekelijkse inhoudelijke redactievergadering, en daarnaast spreken we flexibel af en werken we samen via Teams.  



  

  

**Wat breng jij mee?**


* Je hebt journalistieke ervaring, en een portfolio van artikelen en verhalen waar je trots op bent.
* Je bent nieuwsgierig, onderzoekend en kritisch en verdiept je graag in de hete hangijzers en trends binnen de branche.
* Je houdt van de afwisseling die werken op een redactie meebrengt, je vindt het leuk mee te denken over en te schakelen tussen het schrijven van nieuwsberichten en scoops enerzijds en inhoudelijke artikelen die diepgravend onderzoek vragen anderzijds.
* Je hebt kennis van de financiële dienstverlening, of bovengemiddelde interesse en de wil om snel alles te weten te komen over onze doelgroep.


**Ons aanbod**


* Bij VMN kom je om te leren, de ruimte om je journalistieke ideeën te realiseren, en voor de goede werk/privé balans. Wij werken hybride en je hebt veel vrijheid om je eigen werkweek in te delen.
* Wij organiseren veel sociale en inhoudelijke bijeenkomsten, waar je ook de andere VMN collega’s ontmoet, zo kun je leren van en ervaringen uitwisselen met andere journalisten/redacteuren en externe sprekers of trainers. Hoogwaardige journalistiek is de kern van onze organisatie: hierin investeren vinden we belangrijk.
* Een diverse en inclusieve werkomgeving, waar iedereen welkom is en waar we voortdurend werken aan het verhogen van ieders werkgeluk.
* Natuurlijk krijg je ook een goed salaris, een keuzebudget van 12%, een goed pensioen, 20 vakantiedagen per jaar op basis van 36 uur per week en de mogelijkheid om tot 3 weken extra vakantie bij te kopen vanuit je keuzebudget, een laptop en telefoon, reiskostenvergoeding (km) of OV Business Card.

**Functieomschrijving**  

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van het AD in Rotterdam. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data. Dat betekent dat je met cijfers bezig bent, maar ook veel met redactieleden overlegt en ze traint in hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter online presenteren. Je analyseert, rapporteert en geeft dus advies.

  


Je gaat op zoek naar antwoorden op vragen als: Waarom haken mensen af in een artikel? Wat is de ideale mix aan verhalen? Wat is de optimale spreiding van artikelen over de dag? En waarom stijgt of zakt het bezoek de afgelopen weken?

  


De adviezen geef je op drie ‘snelheden’: live, in dag- en weekrapporten en in losse analyses. Op de dag zelf kijk je met een schuin oog mee naar de cijfers en deel je belangrijke actiegerichte inzichten met de redactie. In dag- en weekrapporten geef je duiding aan de cijfers. Naast de dagelijkse taken voer je ook regelmatig diepgravende analyses uit.

  


Je bent een belangrijke sparringpartner voor de chefs en hoofdredactie bij AD en werkt nauw met hen samen.

Naast redactie-analisten zijn er diverse centrale rollen in het team die jou bij je werk zullen ondersteunen.  

  

**Functieprofiel**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.


**VOORWAARDEN**


* salaris, passend bij jouw ervaring;
* 38-urige werkweek, minder uur in overleg;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;
* ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden d.m.v. opleidingen en trainingen;
* We geloven in een gezonde werk-privébalans waarbij je voldoende ruimte krijgt voor jouw welzijn en flexibel werken.

**Team Code**


Team Code houdt zich bezig met ontwerpend onderzoek. We ontwerpen nieuwe technologie en nemen publieke waarden als uitgangspunt: technologie is namelijk niet zomaar een instrument, maar kan het (samen)leven van mensen diepgaand beïnvloeden. Code kijkt hoe technologie de positie van burgers kan versterken: democratisering door middel van digitalisering. Het team bestaat uit software ontwerpers, techniek filosofen en sociale wetenschappers.

**Over Waag Futurelab**


Waag Futurelab doet al bijna 30 jaar onderzoek naar hoe technologie kan worden ingezet voor sociale innovatie. Bekende projecten van Waag zijn o.a. Fairphone, de meest duurzame smartphone ter wereld of De Digitale Stad, een van de allereerste social media platforms van Nederland. Of denk aan Operatie Sigismund, een van de eerste educatieve games in Nederland die leerlingen laat ervaren hoe spannend een archief is en nog steeds wekelijks gespeeld wordt in het Drents Archief.


 Je toekomstige collega Ouarda vertelt over werken bij Waag*: ‘De vrijheid die ik van de organisatie krijg om mijn eigen projecten in te kleuren doet mij heel erg goed. Collega’s waarderen mij, ik kan mezelf zijn en dat maakt het een fijne werkplek.’*


Waag werkt in een team van ontwerpers, kunstenaars en wetenschappers, dat publieke onderzoeksmethoden toepast op technologie en de samenleving. Daarmee stelt Waag zoveel mogelijk mensen in staat mee te ontwerpen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Dat doen we door gezamenlijk opkomende technologie te onderzoeken en onderliggende culturele aannames te bevragen en door alternatieven te ontwerpen op basis van publieke waarden. Zo proberen we bij te dragen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Op waag.org vind je meer informatie over Waag en over de projecten waaraan wij werken.


Diversiteit is cruciaal om technologie en de samenleving meer open, eerlijk en inclusief te maken. Daarom moedigen we kandidaten van diverse culturele achtergronden aan om te solliciteren. Mocht je denken niet aan alle eisen te voldoen, willen we je toch aanmoedigen om te solliciteren. Sommige kwaliteiten zijn niet in bulletpoints te vangen.

* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.



Als hoofdredacteur Arbo ben je onderdeel van de centrale redactie van het ‘professionals portfolio’ van VMN media, waar ook PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb onderdeel van zijn. Samen zijn we een team van 14 personen.

 **Wat krijg je:**


* **Fijn team** – Leuke, betrokken collega’s die samen mooie content voor de doelgroep maken. Binnen het Arbo-team, maar ook in nauwe samenwerking binnen het professionals portfolio.
* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.



Verder nog handig om te weten: het gaat om een functie van 36 uur per week. Het kantoor van VMN media staat in Zeist.


**Je bent overtuigd**
