**Your Impact**
---------------


As the Product Adoption Senior Specialist, Change Management, you will join our People Services Enablement team as part of the global People function driving the transformation of our core People and Payroll processes through digital enablement.
You will work with our global People and Payroll communities as we transform the way we provide services to our firm members. The digitization of core People processes is one of the fundamental ways we are professionalizing our firm and creating an unrivaled environment for exceptional firm function talent.
The role will focus on the rollout and implementation of the ServiceNow People \& Payroll product, a part of the firm’s ServiceNow platform, to enable our People and Payroll process transformation. ServiceNow is the firm’s service management platform that provides transparency to work, increases efficiency, and streamlines global processes. We have undergone intense growth over the past 3 years with great success. We have made substantial impact by enabling self\-help and laying the foundation for generative AI (gen AI) and digital workflows which in turn has driven more increased demand for this product and projects continued growth.
For the next horizon of work, you will drive the overall adoption of ServiceNow People \& Payroll, lead change management, and support the People and Payroll functions to fully adopt this digital platform. This includes working directly with our global community of process leads to understand and anticipate impacts and implications of this technology on roles and responsibilities, processes, and workflows. You will shape, develop, and execute a strategy for changing colleague behavior and ensuring sustainable adoption of this platform across all user communities during and beyond initial implementation.
In this role, we will rely upon your passion for learning, passion for helping others, and aptitude to test, fail and try to come up with solutions that help our end users. This role has potential to grow – on the People side: to serve as a thought partner for our global HR, Payroll and People Operations teams to best utilize this digital solution and develop effective user support strategies; on the technical side, to get exposure to product development and system design and recommend enhancements to the product to encourage deeper user adoption.
For the first year in the role, the focus will split. One focus will be on implementations to expand to more groups such as HR and Payroll into Europe, Middle East, Africa, and others as prioritized by our People leaders. A second focus is working with our product team, user researchers and designers to influence product design and development to take into account product adoption. In parallel, you will help support an existing global group of global users that has on\-going training, documentation, and digital platform needs. Since ServiceNow People \& Payroll enables most processes in the People function, you will actively collaborate across a broad set of domains and teams.
**Your Growth**
---------------


As the Product Adoption Specialist, you will be a key member of the People Services Enablement team, which operates within the broader People Technology group and collaborates closely with the Tech Ecosystem. This team bridges the gap between process and technology, leveraging digital tools to drive people and payroll process transformation, achieve business outcomes, and innovate workflows. Covering the entire firm member lifecycle—from talent acquisition and onboarding to learning, professional development, and talent management—you may also partner with other People Technology product teams to ensure seamless integration and support.
In addition to this, you will work closely with the ServiceNow Center of Excellence and Innovation (CoEI), which unifies digital capabilities across the firm, and collaborate with Tech Ecosystem resources like user research and design to ground your change management plans in user insights and thoughtful design.
In this role, you will focus on driving adoption and engagement with the ServiceNow People \& Payroll platform across a globally distributed team in Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Germany, India, Poland, Spain, and the United States. You will design and execute change management plans for global implementations, develop and deliver tailored training programs, and create communication strategies with supporting materials to engage stakeholders. Acting as an expert and advocate for the system, you will provide ongoing coaching to champion user groups, offer guidance to individual users and teams, and address process gaps through digital solutions.
Lastly, you will monitor user metrics to inform strategies, stay updated on product enhancements, and lead efforts to adopt new features, ensuring the platform evolves to meet user needs effectively.

In this thesis, you will generate synthetic training data by transforming low\-poly 3D models of hands and feet into photorealistic images with labeled key points.

**Areas of Interest:** Generative AI, Controllable Image Generation, Few\-shot Learning


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


The examination of Parkinson’s symptoms is highly labor\-intensive, as it requires multiple trained neurologists to thoroughly analyze hand and leg movements. A group of hospitals aims to extend Parkinson’s treatment in the Netherlands to regions where such care is currently unavailable due to a shortage of trained neurologists. To achieve this, they want to make a pre\-selection through the help of AI on a smartphone. Part of the solution is a pose estimation model to track hand and foot movements. However, the current dataset for training the model is neither large nor diverse enough. The goal is to enrich the dataset with highly varied data while minimizing the need for manual effort.


Important features for detecting hands and feet could be better balanced by enriching the training dataset with synthetic data. To prevent manual labeling of the training data, it would be ideal if the ground truth for tracking key points is synthesized along with the training images. By converting low\-poly 3D models with key point rigs into photorealistic images, a synthetic dataset of labeled training images could be generated. Your task will be to investigate how to transform low\-poly models into photorealistic images using AI.

**The Assignment**
------------------


You will create a training dataset consisting of low\-poly 3D body rigs, focusing on the hands and feet. Next, you will explore transforming these low\-poly models into photorealistic images using a pix2pix GAN model. You may also fine\-tune the model to optimize hyperparameters for generating the best results. Your findings will be documented in a thesis and presented during your thesis defense.

**About us**

Although we take more photos now than ever, we seldom print them out. This neglects all the beautiful captured moments, as among these numerous photos lie precious memories worth printing. Be it the first pictures of your newborn, your niece or nephew, the amazing city trip with friends, or a fun night out.

With klikkie, we help you celebrate life and cherish memories. We aim to inspire you to make time for small moments and enjoy the present – what truly matters. Every month brings new moments, and it's a shame to forget them. Hence, the idea is to enable everyone to print high\-quality photos with minimal effort, month after month.

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

And we are well on our way! With 4\.1 million members and more than 1,500 clubs in 6 different countries, we are the largest gym chain in Europe, and we’re not slowing down any time soon—we open a new Basic\-Fit almost every day!



One of the reasons we can grow this quickly is because we supercharge our clubs with hardware and software. Because of this our club hosts have more time for our members and it even lets us have clubs accessible 24/7!



We are also very fond of self\-service. We try to make sure that a member has full control over their membership. Going on a long vacation and want to temporarily freeze your membership? There’s a button for that! Canceled your membership but have second thoughts? There’s a button for that! Our goal is that every member is be able to help themselves, whenever they want, wherever they want.



To contribute to our mission we also build features that get our members moving. Either by helping them pick their very first workout or by giving them a little present to get them moving again. We even give users badges for coming to the club!



But be aware, this is not an easy task.



What we do is important to a lot of people, every error and every performance bottleneck can have impact on the fitness experience a member has. As a developer you need to make sure that all our software and hardware runs smoothly. This means the applications you build must handle millions of requests without breaking a sweat, and the hardware needs to be properly serviced and operational across all 6 countries. On top of that Basic\-Fit likes to move quickly, and so do our teams! That’s why we minimize unnecessary rituals and focus on the exciting stuff—building software that really matters.



What it takes to work at Basic\-Fit:


* You need to be a problem solver at heart, using software as your weapon of choice.
* You understand that there is wide array of different people required to make the really big impact, and you are not afraid to knock on some doors to get things done.
* Working at Basic\-Fit means you eat scale and complexity for breakfast, and that growth is a guarantee.
* You are eager to take responsibility and know how to manage risk well.
* You are knowledgeable about your craft and have demonstrated experience with at least some of our tech stack (down below).


And that’s where a smart person like you comes in—if you’re up for the challenge.



Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of back\-up!



In Tilburg, a talented team awaits you with open arms. In our development teams, you’ll find a mix of:


* React (Native) developers
* Node.js developers
* Product Owners
* Designers
* QA Engineers


To help you become the best version of yourself, you’ll even have a Talent Coach who looks out for your personal growth.



Besides all the amazing people you get to work with, you’ll also have a powerful arsenal of tools at your disposal:



We build our applications with:


* React
* TypeScript
* Tailwind
* Storybook
* Service Workers
* Next.js / Express
* Cypress


We build our APIs with:


* Nest.js
* TypeScript
* Prisma
* Postgres
* Redis
* Azure EventGrid
* Azure ServiceBus


To keep everything running, we use:


* Heroku as our cloud environment
* Azure DevOps for all of our repositories and CI/CD pipelines
* New Relic as our logging, monitoring, and alerting stack
* Akamai as our primary WAF and CDN
* GitHub Copilot as your AI pair\-programming partner


If the challenge, the people, and the software weren’t enough… working at basic\-fit also comes with a few nice perks!


* A free Basic\-Fit gym membership;
* We host internal hackathons (sometimes even in the club!)
* An informal (you can wear jeans and sneakers if you like), international (many cultures and languages) and friendly, down\-to\-earth environment;
* Plenty of opportunities for your own initiatives and to make an impact;
* Unlimited access to the online training courses of LinkedinLearning and GoodHabitz;
* Good benefits, including travel allowance, a bicycle plan, discount on additional health insurance, work from home allowance and participation in our pension scheme (Basic\-Fit pays 52% of the premium);
* We work hybrid, this means 3 days at the office and 2 days remote by a fulltime workweek;
* You will be working in a brand\-new office in the Plan\-T building next to Tilburg Central Station;
* A beautiful gym (fitness equipment, spinning bikes, virtual group lessons) at our headquarters which you can use anytime.

We’re crafting a metric that measures how achievable AI\-generated advice is—for real people. Think of it as teaching AI common sense; for instance, you can’t just age a decade instantly. Your challenge: integrate advanced language models like GPT to gauge if a “what if” scenario is useful or just a tech fantasy. Join us in shaping a more sensible, user\-centric AI future.**

**Areas of Interest:** XAI/Explainable AI, LLMs/Large Language Models, ChatGPT, NLP/Natural Language Processing


Counterfactual explanations are considered an intuitive and user\-friendly form of explainable AI. A counterfactual explanation proposes minimal changes to the input data that would lead to a different model output. As an example, a bank could make use of a model to determine if a customer can get a loan or not. If a customer was denied a loan, a counterfactual explanation could tell them that, for instance, “if their savings were increased by 10\.000€, they could get the loan”.


However, counterfactual explanations are not aware of the semantics of the input features. It might be that the minimal change for a customer to get a loan is to “increase their age from 25 to 35 years old” which, from a human perspective, is evidently unfeasible in a short time span.

**The Assignment**
------------------


In this project, we would like you to design a new evaluation metric to automatically determine the practicality of counterfactuals, that is, how attainable a counterfactual explanation is (or if it is even humanly attainable). Since the determination of practicality involves semantic understanding of the input features, our idea would be to leverage GPT and/or other large language model\-based technologies to accomplish this.


A user study could be conducted initially following the methodology proposed by Spreitzer et al (1\) to evaluate the practicality of different state\-of\-the\-art counterfactual techniques. The user study can then be extended to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed metric compared to the human evaluations.

Scala is gaining more traction as a programming language for large software systems, it is used in companies such a Netflix and Twitter and is the base for many great products.


Libraries such a Finagle and Akka are being used in many JVM based products. The quality of such core components and large software systems needs to be guaranteed. For Java and other object oriented and functional programming languages code quality metrics and guidelines are available. Unfortunately for Scala, a multi paradigm programming language, this is not yet the case. We would like to research code quality metrics and guidelines for Scala. Since Scala is a multi\-paradigm language, we can use research for both objected oriented and functional programming languages.


Previously, we have shown that we are able to use existing object oriented and functional metrics to predict bug density in Scala projects. This means there is a relation between different metrics and the possibility of bugs. Additionally, we identified constructs and metrics in Scala that are prone to bugs. We would like to extend this research to be able to pinpoint such constructs in Scala code as part of code analysis in a continuous integration pipeline.

It does this by only revealing so called ‘attributes’ of a person. Can CryptPad be improved by integrating IRMA by comparing approaches for authentication and digital signatures?**

**Areas of Interest:** Cryptography, Security, Open Source


When you want to prove that you are older than 18 to buy a bottle of whiskey it shouldn’t be necessary to show your ID card which also contains your name, BSN and date of birth. Only the fact that you are 18\+ should be sufficient. IRMA can achieve this by securely disclose certain attributes about you using your mobile phone running the IRMA app (https://irma.app) It protects your privacy by only show attributes that are sufficient in this situation, namely the attributing stating that you are older than 18\. Therefore, your name and date of birth cannot be abused by a third party to commit for example identity fraud. This attribute\-based authentication only reveals what you are and not who you are.


IRMA also offers attribute\-based signatures which improve on the traditional digital signature done with a private key and a corresponding certificate containing the public key. These IRMA signatures are constructed by enclosing a number of attributes of the signer to the document. For example, signing a medical recipe using the docter’s medical attribute stating that the recipe comes from a real doctor. This is a big advantage over traditional signatures because it gives information about who actually signs it. IRMA is open source and available to integrate with other services for which authentication and signatures are important.


Such a service can be CryptPad (https://cryptpad.fr) with which you can make collaborative documents. It uses client side encryption to make sure it’s protected from other people that can access the server. Other people can read your documents by sharing your cryptographic key that is never sent to the server. Moreover, your username and password are used only to generate a unique keyring and the server only knows your signature to identify you and retrieve your documents. This Zero Knowledge application makes a good candidate to research whether integrating it with the IRMA system has further potential benefits.


You will research whether CryptPad can be improved by integrating IRMA by comparing approaches for authentication and digital signatures. Perhaps the attribute\-based signatures can add value to prove the origin of the documents you write with CryptPad? What about the different authentication flows of both systems? This research includes setting up IRMA, integrate it with CryptPad, analyze approaches and motivate your choices to potentially improve CryptPad.

Stryker Mutator, an open\-source mutation testing framework by Info Support is allready fast, but it is up to you to find areas to improve, in order to speed up mutation testing.**

**Areas of Interest:** Software Architecture, Software Development Methodologies, Open Source


A mutation testing framework will measure the effectiveness of unit tests by inserting mutants (bugs) inside your production code and running the (unit) tests. If the tests pass for a given mutant, then there might be a missing test case. The mutant ‘survived’ in that case. If at least one of the tests fails, then the mutant is ‘killed’. The percentage of killed mutants is referred to as the ‘mutation score’ and is a metric for test effectiveness.


At Info Support, we maintain Stryker Mutator, an open\-source mutation testing framework. It consists of 3 flavors: Stryker.NET (C\#), Stryker4s (Scala), and Stryker (for JavaScript and friends). For more info, see https://stryker\-mutator.io.


There are many ways of introducing mutants into the source code. Mutating sources statement by statement is a logical choice, but not good for performance as the codebase needs to be recompiled or reloaded after every mutation. Mutation switching can provide a solution to speed up the process. With mutation switching all mutants are compiled into the codebase at once and switched on one\-by\-one at runtime. In the case of Stryker.NET and Styker4s this has resulted in a significant performance boost.


We would like to increase the performance of Stryker even further. Research will focus on finding areas where improvements can be made and/or developing methodologies for speeding up mutation testing.

Traditional penetration tests help identify vulnerabilities but cannot guarantee complete coverage. In this thesis, you will explore the potential of formal verification to strengthen authentication mechanisms in a healthcare portal. By using mathematical models, you’ll investigate whether it’s possible to prove that unauthorized access can be fully prevented, providing an extra layer of confidence in the system’s security.**

**Areas of Interest:** Formal Verification, Security, Model Checking, .NET


This master’s thesis is part of the graduation project ‘Ontzorg de zorg, zorg voor jezelf!’. This project gives the healthcare sector a digital boost through automation and data analysis, allowing caregivers to spend more time with patients while enabling patients to take control of their personal health data.


One of our clients in the healthcare sector has developed a portal that facilitates communication between various organizations, reducing Dutch healthcare costs by millions of euros each year. Numerous individuals need to log into this portal daily, and it also supports system\-to\-system connections with their customers. Ensuring the security of sensitive health data is of utmost importance.


Our clients usually perform security assessments by hiring a security firm to conduct penetration tests on their systems. While effective, these pen\-tests do not guarantee 100% coverage, and it’s always possible for some leaks to go undetected.


Recent advancements in formal verification have made it possible to mathematically prove certain properties of systems. This technique has been used in security\-critical software to establish robustness (under certain assumptions). For example, the popular VPN software WireGuard has undergone of formal verification. See: Formal Verification – WireGuard


We are curious if such techniques are also applicable on the software that we develop. Our client’s portal involves several types of users, each requiring authentication. Additionally, inter\-service communication is performed in various ways, all of which are encrypted and authenticated. The system consists of multiple front\-ends, microservices, a large monolith, and system\-to\-system connections with third parties.

**The Assignment**

Your assignment is to apply formal verification to the authentication mechanism of our client’s system. For instance, you could aim to prove that it is impossible to gain unauthorized access to a part of the system. You will choose a suitable verification tool, which will likely involve creating a model of the system, selecting specific properties to verify, and formalizing them within your chosen tool. It is crucial to ensure that your model closely represents the actual system while minimizing assumptions.

However, these systems present challenges, particularly with model agnostic explanations which are more approximations.

Effective testing is crucial to verify if explanations are sensible to experts, consistent across different outcomes, and to understand when they might change.**

**Areas of Interest:** Artificial Intelligence, Explainable AI


Explainable machine learning and artificial intelligence models have been used to justify a model’s decision\-making process. This added transparency aims to help improve user performance and understanding of the underlying model. However, in practice, explainable systems face many open questions and challenges.


Model agnostic explanations are more approximations. In general there are two kinds of explanations: global and local explanations. For the latter, there’s the possibility that the explanation is off, because it only looks at the local inference. It’s possible that for opposite inference, we get exactly the same explanations. To get proper explanations we’ll need to be able to test them. Are the explanations sensible to business experts and aren’t there any same explanations for opposite outcomes? And do we know when explanations will change?

***Excited to shape the future of hearing aids? Ready to combine your expertise in Signal Processing, Optimization and Machine learning with Perception and Intelligibility?***

  


**Job description**


Good hearing is essential for active participation in society. Hearing impairments can lead to various challenges, from frustration and social isolation—such as difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments—to serious safety risks, like the inability to localize sound sources in traffic.

  


Hearing aids help mitigate hearing loss by enhancing speech intelligibility, improving sound localization, and increasing environmental awareness. However, most existing hearing aid algorithms optimize for only one of these objectives at a time, often at the expense of the others. To enhance hearing aid performance across diverse scenarios, we aim to develop innovative algorithms that dynamically balance the improvement of speech intelligibility, sound localization, and environmental awareness, dependent on the context.


To tackle this challenge, we are seeking a postdoctoral researcher with expertise in speech signal processing, optimization, machine learning, and models of hearing and perception.

  

This is a full\-time, three\-year position within the audio and speech processing team of the Signal Processing Systems (SPS) Section. In the SPS section, we conduct research in array signal processing, graph signal processing, convex optimization, distributed processing, machine learning, and tensor analysis. Our applications span various domains, including audio and acoustics, wireless communication, radio astronomy, biomedical signal processing, and distributed sensing from space.

  


Your Role


* Conduct innovative research on signal processing for hearing aids.
* Contribute to writing research proposals.

 Assist with the supervision of students and teaching activities.  
* 

**Job requirements**


* PhD in a relevant field (e.g., electrical engineering, acoustics, or a related discipline).
* Strong background in speech signal processing, machine learning, and optimization.
* Experienced with models of hearing and perception.
* Experienced with C/C\+\+ and/or Matlab/Python
* Good communication skills for interaction with the other members of the team are expected.
* Good English language skills in order to closely cooperate with colleagues and students as well as to write scientific papers.

**Role description**
--------------------


At Medis, we are committed to staying at the forefront of technological innovation. As part of this ambition, we are exploring how Generative AI, including LLMs and agentic AI, can enhance our software development, data workflows, and product innovation.

We are looking for a curious and hands\-on Generative AI Intern to support this exploration. In this role, you will collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to identify and assess use cases, evaluate risks and opportunities, and build proof\-of\-concept solutions that demonstrate the value of GenAI across Medis — from MedTech innovation to internal workflows and software development processes.
  

This is an applied research internship focused on the practical use of existing AI tools—not on developing new deep learning models or neural networks. You’ll work with tools like ChatGPT, open\-source LLMs, prompt engineering techniques, and agentic AI frameworks to test and validate ideas.
  

**The profile we are looking for:**
-----------------------------------


* Currently enrolled in a Master’s program focused on Artificial Intelligence (e.g., AI, Applied AI, Cognitive AI, AI \& Data Science, or similar).
* Familiarity with generative AI tools and concepts (e.g., LLMs, agentic AI, prompt engineering).
* Hands\-on experience with scripting or prototyping using tools such as Python, JavaScript, or Node.js.
* Familiarity with frameworks such as LangChain, Hugging Face, or vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate) is a plus.
* Currently residing in the Netherlands.
* Available for a period of 6 months, for at least 32 hours per week.
**Personal skills and competences**
-----------------------------------


* Analytical and proactive.
* Comfortable working both independently and collaboratively within a team.
* Can clearly communicate complex technical ideas to both technical and non\-technical colleagues.
* Excellent written and spoken English.
**What Medis offers you:**
--------------------------


* Hands\-on experience with cutting\-edge Generative AI tools, working on real\-world projects with a multidisciplinary team, in a forward\-thinking company.
* A supportive environment where your ideas and initiative are valued.
* A competitive internship allowance and reimbursement for travel expenses.
* Flexible, hybrid working environment with international and young colleagues.

**The Opportunity: Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst**


We are looking for an experienced Senior Data \& Reporting Analyst to take a lead role in transforming data into actionable insights that drive strategic decision\-making across the company. In this hands\-on role, you will design and deliver business\-critical dashboards and analytical reports that inform how we improve patient access and grow our business. As a senior individual contributor on our Data \& Analytics team, you’ll work alongside a Data Engineer and fellow Analysts within our Product \& Engineering organization. You will collaborate cross\-functionally with stakeholders in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial, and Product, becoming a go\-to expert for data insights.


**What You'll be Doing:**


In your first 3–6 months, you will hit the ground running by spearheading the creation of several high\-impact dashboards, including:

* Client Program Performance Dashboards – to monitor and visualize our patient programs' performance and identify opportunities to improve outcomes.
* Revenue Tracking Dashboards – to provide real\-time visibility into revenue streams and financial KPIs, helping steer commercial strategy.

**This is the right opportunity for you if:**

* Design, build, and maintain interactive dashboards and reports in Tableau (and other BI tools) to track key metrics across the business. You will own end\-to\-end dashboard development – from gathering requirements to data modeling and visualization – ensuring stakeholders have self\-service access to up\-to\-date insights.
* Deliver actionable insights for growth: Analyze operational and marketing data (from MySQL/PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases, Airflow, Excel, etc.) to understand key performance drivers. Translate data into clear findings and recommendations that drive user acquisition, patient engagement, and sustainable business growth.
* Be the analytical partner for leadership: Serve as a point of contact for the leadership team on all things data. Provide in\-depth reporting, ad\-hoc analysis, and executive\-friendly dashboards that inform strategic decisions and highlight trends in business performance.
* Focus on data quality and accuracy: Work closely with our Data Engineer and product engineers to ensure we have reliable, well\-structured data. Help maintain and validate data models, databases and data pipelines so that reports are accurate and reflect the single source of truth. Identify any data gaps or integrity issues and collaborate on solutions.
* Drive performance improvements: Monitor key KPIs (such as program success metrics, funnel conversion rates, revenue metrics) and proactively identify operational bottlenecks or areas for improvement. Provide insight\-driven suggestions to optimize workflows, improve patient recruitment, or streamline processes.
* Cross\-functional collaboration: Partner with teams in Operations, Growth, Marketing, Commercial and Product to understand their analytics needs. Support these stakeholders by building custom reports or exploratory analysis, and ensure they can leverage your dashboards for day\-to\-day decision making. For example, you might deep\-dive into marketing funnel data to advise the Growth team, or analyze operational turnaround times to assist the Operations team.
* Advanced analysis and data exploration: Use Python (with pandas, numpy, etc.) and SQL for deeper ad\-hoc analyses, data discovery, and data preparation. When questions go beyond existing reports, you’ll dig into raw data to uncover insights, validate hypotheses, and prepare datasets for further analysis.
* Mentorship and best practices: As a senior analyst, mentor and guide junior analysts on the team. Review their work, share knowledge of best practices in analytics, SQL querying, and visualization. Lead by example in documentation and reproducibility. You will also enable business users’ self\-service by training stakeholders on how to use established dashboards and reporting tools effectively.
* Shape data strategy: Contribute to our overall data strategy by identifying new metrics or analytics opportunities that can drive value. Advocate for a data\-driven mindset across the organization. You’ll play a key role in evolving our analytics capabilities (for instance, suggesting new BI features or improving reporting processes) to support a scaling, high\-growth environment.

* Experience using Python for data analysis tasks – e.g. data cleaning, exploration, and validation using libraries such as pandas or numpy. Must be comfortable scripting to manipulate data when needed.

Experience creating a variety of chart types and visuals – from standard bar/line charts to more advanced visuals like Sankey diagrams or funnel charts – to illustrate user flows and attribution. An eye for design and attention to detail in dashboards ensuring they are accurate, easy to interpret, and visually engaging.
* Analytical Mindset: Excellent analytical and problem\-solving skills. Capable of interpreting complex datasets, identifying trends and outliers, and connecting the dots between data and business outcomes. You approach problems with curiosity and a hypothesis\-driven mindset.
* Business Acumen: Strong understanding of business metrics and growth drivers. Ability to translate business questions from non\-technical stakeholders into analytical approaches, and then translate back findings into business terms. Experience working on metrics like revenue, conversion funnels, customer acquisition cost, etc., is highly valued.
* Exceptional communication skills in English (our company language). You can distill complex analyses into clear insights and narratives for different audiences. Comfortable presenting findings to senior leadership and guiding discussions on data.
* Collaboration: Proven ability to work cross\-functionally and build positive relationships with diverse teams — from operations managers to product designers. You’re a team player who can align data projects with the needs of multiple departments and manage stakeholder expectations.

----------------


ASML, the largest supplier for photolithography systems in the semiconductor industry, provides machines to chipmakers to enable mass production of chips on silicon wafers. ASML’s core strength is the lithography technology itself, while the building of the chipmakers is merely an assembly of parts provided by suppliers.  

  

The Supplier Quality Engineer (SQE) is responsible for introducing new parts into the supplier base for ASML lithography systems. A key role of our department’s is ensuring that these parts are delivered with the requisite quality standards.

**Your assignment**
-------------------


ASML makes designs for parts of our machine that are externally manufactured by our suppliers. These suppliers review our designs and give feedback on various aspects (correctness, manufacturability, testability, etc.). Beside of correcting the design, this feedback is also used for the feedback\-loop to our design community, for improving design quality. In order to do this effectively this feedback is categorized.  

This categorization (or bucketing) is initially done by our suppliers, and later on corrected by the SQE, which takes a lot of effort. In order to reduce this effort, we want to investigate if this can be done or supported by AI.


Your assignment will focus on:

* Applying Artificial Intelligence to categorize (bucket) the feedback raised by the supplier according to the fixed bucketing scheme as used in the review tool;
* Applying AI to categorize the feedback inside each bucket, to indicate the common mistakes made;
* Implementation will be done based on datasets in excel;
* Reporting to show outcome;


This is an apprentice internship (to gain work experience) for minimum 6 months for 5 days per week. The start date is flexible (latest starting date Sept '25\).

**Your profile**
----------------

**To be a perfect match with this internship, you:**

* Are a Bachelor or Master student in the direction Business Administration, Industrial Engineering and Management, Data analytics or AI;
* Have knowledge about artificial intelligence engines;
* Have knowledge of applications and the ability to apply on large data sets;
* Are a proactive person with a can\-do mindset;
* Have strong stakeholder management skills;

**Other requirements you need to meet**

* You are enrolled at an educational institute for the entire duration of the internship;
* You need to be located in the Netherlands to be perform your internship. In case you ‘re currently living/studying outside of the Netherlands, your CV/motivation letter includes the willingness to relocate.
* If you are a non\-EU citizen, studying in the Netherlands, your university is willing to sign the documents relevant for doing an internship (i.e., Nuffic agreement).

*This position requires access to controlled technology, as defined in the* *United States* *Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. § 730, et seq.). Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such controlled technology prior to beginning work. Business demands may require ASML to proceed with candidates who are immediately eligible to access controlled technology.*

Onze prioriteit is het afhandelen en zoveel mogelijk herstellen van schade die mensen en gebouwen oplopen en hebben opgelopen door de gaswinning uit het Groningenveld of van de gasopslag Norg.

Onderzoek tijdens deze opdracht aan de hand van best\-practices hoe je met Python op Apache Spark ETL jobs kan maken. Het resultaat van deze opdracht gaat medebepalen of we afscheid gaan nemen van Python notebooks.**

**Interessegebieden:** Data engineering, Software ontwikkeling met Python, DevOps, Azure Cloud


Data engineers werken met verschillende tools om systemen te bouwen die ruwe data verzamelen, beheren en transformeren in bruikbare informatie. Databricks en Azure Synaps Analytics zijn voorbeelden van relatief nieuwe oplossingen die veel gebruikt worden in een cloud\-based data platform. Development wordt binnen deze oplossingen gedaan met notebooks. Een notebook is een web\-based interface voor een document met uitvoerbare code, visualisaties en documentatie. Het werken met notebooks biedt zeker voordelen. Lokale installaties zijn bijvoorbeeld overbodig, je kan documentatie en code mixen en je hebt built\-in support voor visualisaties. Er zijn echter ook nadelen. Voorbeelden daarvan zijn:

* Een cluster/compute is nodig om te kunnen ontwikkelen (startup time, kosten, etc.)
* Een cluster bevat modules welke lokaal niet te installeren zijn (code is dus enkel bruikbaar op één environment)
* Geen support voor debugging (print statements niet meegerekend)
* Geen linting
* Geen auto\-formatting
* Geen support voor tests
* Slechte support voor monitoring


Kortom, het volledig toepassen van DevOps principes (automatisering, monitoring, testen, deployment) zoals dat kan bij een reguliere software applicatie is niet mogelijk wanneer enkel gewerkt wordt met notebooks.

**De opdracht**
---------------


Onderzoek hoe je op basis van best\-practices met Python op Apache Spark ETL jobs kan maken, zodat we afscheid kunnen nemen van onze huidige werkwijze met Python notebooks. Denk hierbij aan oplossingen voor vragen als:

* Hoe gaan we ETL jobs testen met unit\-tests?
* Hoe gaan we om met deployment van jobs?
* Hoe kun je lokaal je job debuggen?


Maak vervolgens op basis van een praktijkcase een Proof of Concept om te bewijzen dat de onderzochte concepten werken. Beschrijf tot slot de werkwijze en geef een advies hoe we onze bestaande notebooks kunnen omzetten naar jobs.

-------------------

**“Kunstmatige Intelligentie voor het waterbeheer in centraal Nederland”**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Kunstmatige Intelligentie (AI) is een techniek die sinds de jaren '50 wordt toegepast. De lancering van ChatGPT heeft gezorgd dat deze techniek in een enorme stroomversnelling is gekomen. Exemplarisch hiervoor is dat ChatGPT binnen 5 dagen al 1 miljoen gebruikers had terwijl een platform als Netflix hier 3\.5 jaar over deed.


Bij HDSR zijn we bezig met de ontwikkeling van een modern data platform met bijbehorende tooling. De aanwezigheid van deze centrale plek maakt het mogelijk om nieuwe technieken, zoals generatieve AI, te gaan ontwikkelen en testen. Recent is er een haalbaarheidsstudie over tooling voor Generative AI uitgevoerd, een zogenaamde Proof of Concept (PoC). De resultaten van deze studie hebben bijgedragen aan intern beleid om (generatieve) AI binnen de juiste kaders en volgens de juiste richtlijnen te gebruiken.


Een aanbeveling die er ligt om het gebruik van AI binnen de organisatie verder vorm te geven is om ***een interne AI\-werkgroep op te zetten***. Deze AI\-werkgroep faciliteert een centrale plek in de organisatie waar kennis over AI ingebracht en opgehaald kan worden, waar vragen kunnen worden gesteld en waar innovatieve ideeën op het gebied van AI uit kunnen worden gewisseld. Een onderdeel van deze stage is om mee te werken aan het opzetten van deze interne AI\-werkgroep.


Daarnaast zijn er nog ***legio andere mogelijke AI Use Cases*** die uitgevoerd kunnen worden. We genereren bijvoorbeeld documentatie over de objecten die het watersysteem reguleren en controleren (het beheerregister) binnen onze huidige administratieve\-, ingenieurs\- en waterbeheer\-werkzaamheden. Of er is in de werkvoorbereiding informatie nodig die intern en extern gedeeld kan worden. Naast deze onderwerpen zijn er ook nog andere toepassingsmogelijkheden, zoals bijvoorbeeld het omzetten van 2\-dimensionale naar van 3\-dimensionale tekeningen of het analyseren van dronebeelden om zwakke plekken in onze dijken te lokaliseren.


***In overleg met jou*** zullen we ***nog een onderwerp kiezen voor een PoC met generatieve AI***. Hierna zal een introductie volgen van de betrokken collega's om daarna de techniek in te duiken en te ontwikkelen. Er zullen regelmatig momenten voor feedback ingepland worden met de betrokken collega's uit de afdelingen en je zal dagelijkse begeleiding krijgen om te zorgen dat de te ontwikkelen producten ook voldoen aan de interne eisen. Hierbij kunnen verschillende werkmethodieken (bv. Agile, scrum, DevOps, Lean Six Sigma) aan bod komen die houvast geven, en waarvoor ruimte voor verdere verdieping is.


**In dit team kom je te werken**
--------------------------------


Je komt te werken in het Informatie \& Kennis (I\&K) team wat onderdeel is van Ontwikkeling, Strategie \& Advies (OSA). Binnen het I\&K team doen we wetenschappelijk en toegepast onderzoek. I\&K is een team dat focus heeft op de inhoud waarbij we vanuit de techniek ondersteund worden door de afdeling Informatievoorziening \& Automatisering (I\&A). Je dagelijkse begeleiding wordt gedaan door een medewerker uit het Team I\&K, vanuit de organisatorische kant word je begeleid door de I\&K teamleider.


**Waar kun je op rekenen?**
---------------------------


Ons waterschap is een interessante leeromgeving waarin je veel kennis en ervaring kunt opdoen. Daarnaast krijg jij:


* een stagevergoeding van € 500,00 bruto per maand op basis van 36 uur per week.
* een werkplek die goed bereikbaar is met het openbaar vervoer.
* goede stagebegeleiding, afgestemd op jouw behoeften en de vereisten vanuit jouw opleiding.
* niet zomaar een stage, maar een stage waarmee je écht verschil maakt.
* een stage die goed staat op je CV.
* de mogelijkheid om een netwerk op te bouwen binnen het Waterschap en daarmee binnen de publieke sector.
* de mogelijkheid om deel te nemen aan diverse uitjes en events, zoals teamdagen en bezoeken aan andere afdelingen.


**Wat maakt jou succesvol?**
----------------------------


Vind jij dat je een digital native bent en doe je een AI, data science of gerelateerde studie? Wil jij je cloud skills verder ontwikkelen en krijg je energie van het ontwikkelen, testen en kennisdeling?


Als je dan ook nog eens voor een periode van 5 maanden of langer, minimaal 32 uur per week beschikbaar bent voor je stage dan staan we open voor een gesprek!


**Ben je enthousiast?**
-----------------------


We zien je reactie graag tegemoet!


Wil je meer weten over de stageopdracht, heb je zelf ideeën over hoe een waterschap generatieve AI technieken kan gebruiken of wil je kennismaken met je mogelijke dagelijkse begeleider?

-------------------


  
Het NCSC is een sterk datagedreven organisatie: wij verzamelen, analyseren, onderzoeken, verrijken en verspreiden data en informatie. Informatie en dataverwerking vormen daarmee de kern van onze activiteiten. De waarde en kwaliteit van onze producten en diensten hangen direct samen met de toegankelijkheid en kwaliteit van data. De manier waarop wij data verwerken en omzetten bepaalt de kwaliteit van het handelingsperspectief dat wij onze doelgroeporganisaties en partners kunnen bieden.  

Het Data \& Analytics (D\&A) team binnen het NCSC speelt hierin een cruciale rol. Het team is verantwoordelijk voor het ontwikkelen van nieuwe digitale dataproducten, zoals NCSC’s dataplatform, ML/AI modellen en kanalen voor het snel en veilig delen van cyber informatie met afnemers en partners.


**Wat ga je doen?**  

Als Data Scientist ga je, samen met collega Data Scientists en –Engineers, aan de slag met data\-analyses en modelontwikkeling. Je werkt daarbij nauw samen met collega’s met domeinkennis, zoals de Security Specialisten/Analisten en Cyber Threat Intel Specialisten. De Data Science toepassingen zijn uiteenlopend. Zo kan het bijvoorbeeld gaan om het inschalen van dreigings\- en kwetsbaarhedeninformatie, het (gedeeltelijk) automatiseren van producten en processen of early warnings op basis van anomaly detectie in netwerkdata. Alle toepassingen hebben een gemeenschappelijk doel: het tijdig bieden van informatie en advies aan organisaties om cyberincidenten te voorkomen of zo snel mogelijk op te lossen.

Het NCSC werkt aan een digitaal veilig Nederland. Door het tempo waarin het cybersecuritydomein zich ontwikkelt en de rol van het NCSC daarin, ligt er een flinke uitdaging voor de toekomst. Het is voor ons als hét kennisinstituut van cybersecurity in Nederland essentieel dat wij Nederland van kwalitatief hoogwaardige en actuele informatie voorzien, in crisistijd en daarbuiten. Deze kennis en kunde halen wij mede uit en delen wij ook weer met ons netwerk (overheden, bedrijfsleven en andere nationale en internationale partners). Op deze wijze proberen we tijdig in te springen op nieuw ontdekte kwetsbaarheden, aanvalscampagnes en ernstige ICT\-verstoringen om deze te voorkomen en op te lossen. Als het toch misgaat beperken we op deze manier de impact.

**What impact will you make?**
------------------------------


Ben jij geïnteresseerd in innovatie mogelijk gemaakt door cloud technologie? Wil je de toekomst van onze klanten helpen vormgeven en versnellen? Kom dan bij het Cloud Strategy \& Architecture team binnen Deloitte Engineering.


In het digitale landschap van vandaag is technologie cruciaal voor onze klanten om voorop te blijven lopen. Cloud vormt de basis van deze transformatie, omdat het de schaal, snelheid en innovatiekracht biedt nieuwe producten en diensten te ontwikkelen.


Als junior consultant werk je aan de kern van digitale transformatieprojecten. Je identificeert continu nieuwe kansen, ontwikkelt innovatieve oplossingen en biedt strategisch advies aan onze (internationale) klanten. Door de potentie van cloud technologieën te belichten, ondersteun je hen bij het realiseren van grote cloud transformaties en productinnovaties.

**How do you do this?**
-----------------------


Je maakt deel uit van het engineering team en werkt in multidisciplinaire teams aan projecten voor diverse klanten. De projecten verschillen aanzienlijk in inhoud, waardoor geen enkele werkweek hetzelfde is. Dit zijn enkele van je verantwoordelijkheden:

* Je adviseert klanten over hun cloud visie en helpt hen bij het formuleren van een duidelijke strategie en architectuur die aansluit bij hun bedrijfsdoelen. Dit doe je door workshops en interviews te organiseren en de resultaten vervolgens uit te werken in een overzichtelijke PowerPoint presentatie.
* Je denkt actief mee over de inzet van opkomende technologische trends, zoals cloud\-native services, (gen\-) AI en IoT. Je helpt bij het opstellen van strategieën en business cases voor de integratie van deze trends in de bedrijfsvoering van onze klanten.
* Je ondersteunt bedrijven bij het uitvoeren van cloud transformaties door het opstellen van een cloud operating model en het ontwikkelen van FinOps capaciteiten. Je kijkt mee hoe klanten hun clouduitgaven effectief kunnen beheren en optimaliseren.
* Je fungeert als scrum master in de ontwikkeling van een nieuw digitaal platform, waarbij je agile development teams begeleidt en zorgt voor een efficiënte samenwerking en het behalen van projectdoelen.

* Ruil 3 nationale feestdagen voor 3 niet\-nationale feestdagen. Als je wilt.
* Een goede mobiliteitsregeling: de keuze uit verschillende opties zoals een leaseauto, reizen met het OV, een cash budget of een combinatie daarvan.
* Een laptop en iPhone. De iPhone mag je ook privé gebruiken.
* Een tijd\-voor\-tijdregeling. Gebruik de tijd die je op het ene moment meer maakt op momenten die er voor jou toe doen.
* Een pensioenregeling waarbij je eigen bijdrage slechts 2% is. Voor later.
* Mogelijkheid om deel te nemen aan de collectieve zorgkostenregeling.
* Fiscaal voordelige zaken. Denk aan bedrijfsfitness, het aanschaffen van een fiets tegen bruto salaris of de mogelijkheid om een fiets te leasen.
* De mogelijkheid om gebruik te maken van 55 uur oppasdienst per kalenderjaar, als jouw kind 12 jaar of jonger is.
* Een maandelijks budget waarmee je keuzes kunt maken in flexibele arbeidsvoorwaarden zoals extra vakantiedagen of het financieren van een fietsplan.
* Zes weken volledig betaald geboorteverlof voor traditionele huishoudens en regenbooggezinnen.

Je deelt je expertise met ongeveer 90 andere collega's in het Engineering team dat onderdeel is van Deloitte Technology \& Transformation. Ons team richt zich op het bouwen van een eigen multi\-capability engineering team.


Wij zijn cloud engineers die voorzien in de behoeften van onze klanten van vandaag en hun behoeften ontwerpen voor de toekomst.

De complexiteit in de wijk neemt steeds verder toe. Care\- en case\-complexe casuïstiek zijn inmiddels écht van alle dag. Als verpleegkundige bij Sensire richt jij je op de zorg van de toekomst waar (pionieren met) innovatie en digitalisering een belangrijke plaats innemen. Spreekt jou dit aan? Lees dan snel verder!
**Wat ga je doen als verpleegkundige?**  

  

Als verpleegkundige wil jij het liefst aan de slag met zorgtaken waarvoor je bent opgeleid: inventariseren van zorgbehoefte, coördineren van de zorgverlening en uitvoeren van hoog complexe zorg met een combinatie van care\- complex (verpleegtechnisch handelen) en case\-complex (achtergrond/situatie). Door de grote diversiteit aan zorgvragen bij klanten in de wijk is het niet altijd mogelijk om alléén dit type werk te doen, daar moeten we realistisch in zijn. Uiteraard streven we dit wel na.

**Aan de slag in Doetinchem!**


In de regio Doetinchem zijn de teams volop bezig om jou als verzorgende IG nóg meer in je kracht te zetten en jou onderdeel te laten zijn van het verpleegkundig proces. Welke gegevens zijn er nodig? Hoe zetten we de beste zorg voor een specifieke klant neer? Welke ontwikkelingen en kansen zie jij? Allemaal belangrijke informatie die jij hebt omdat je letterlijk binnenstapt bij de klant.


Daarnaast zijn er binnen Sensire volop mogelijkheid om een bijdrage te leveren aan (digitale) zorgtechnologie en zorg op afstand, ook als verzorgende IG. Een mooie kans om naast je dagelijkse werkzaamheden bezig te zijn met de zorg van de toekomst. Samen met de klant ga je na wat er nodig is om mee te kunnen (blijven) doen, zodat de klant het leven kan blijven leiden zoals hij of zij dat graag wil. Een voorbeeld is het inzetten van MIJNSensire. MIJNSensire biedt slimme, vaak digitale zorgoplossingen die het leven van klanten zelfstandiger, prettiger en veiliger maken. Dankzij deze zorgoplossingen krijgen onze klanten de zorg die zij nodig hebben én heb jij de kans om je werk anders in te richten.

 **Over onze teams in Doetinchem**


Doetinchem is een veelzijdige gemeente met in elke wijk een andere sociale mix van bewoners, met alle uitdagingen die daarbij horen. Maar jouw zorgteam is je basis, waar verbinding en gezelligheid belangrijke waarden zijn en de zorgteams van de wijken om je heen nooit ver weg zijn. Echter is het ook belangrijk dat je flexibel bent en een ander team ondersteunt wanneer nodig. We hebben oog voor elkaar en zorgen voor een goede werksfeer waarin we steeds nieuwe inzichten en ideeën opdoen die de kwaliteit van onze zorg ten goede komen. Of je nu een groot of een klein contract hebt, routes of diensten werkt, geregeld samen even koffiedrinken of lunchen en af en toe een teamuitje horen erbij. Zodat je steeds met een goed gevoel jouw wijk in gaat.  

  

**Wie ben jij?**  

  

Werken in de wijk is werken in een uitdagende werkomgeving met veel diversiteit. Je weet eigenlijk nooit wat je achter de deur aantreft. Dat vraagt van jou veel. Snel schakelen en individueel handelen is soms noodzakelijk zonder dat je in de stress schiet. Je draagt hierdoor een grote verantwoordelijkheid. Met een gezonde dosis nieuwsgierigheid weet jij de wensen en behoeften van onze klant feilloos te achterhalen, je weet de juiste prioriteiten te stellen en stemt daar de ondersteuning die je biedt op af. Preventie is een vanzelfsprekend onderdeel van jouw benadering.  

  

  

  

**Praktische zaken**  

  

Om aan de slag je kunnen als verpleegkundige vragen wij een aantal praktische zaken van jou:

* Een afgeronde mbo\-opleiding verpleegkunde niveau 4 of hbo\-V opleiding;
* Je bent in het bezit van een BIG\-registratie en bent minimaal bevoegd voor het uitvoeren van voorbehouden en risicovolle handelingen;
* Je bent in het bezit van een rijbewijs;

Een Verklaring Omtrent het Gedrag (VOG) kun je bij indiensttreding overleggen.  
* 

  

**Zo dragen we bij aan jouw werkgeluk**  

  

Er zijn een aantal zaken waar je zelf de regie op kunt en moet pakken. Je hebt daardoor de vrijheid om keuzes te maken die passen bij jouw persoonlijke situatie en behoeften en zorgen voor een goede balans tussen werk en privé.

* Jij maakt de keuze hoeveel uur per week je wil werken. De planner zet dit naar rato van je contract om naar een aantal diensten van zes of acht uur. Je hoeft hierdoor minder dagen per week te werken en er zijn geen gebroken diensten meer;
* Bij Sensire werken we met diensten van 6 of 8 uur die bestaan uit geplande klantzorg en niet\-geplande tijd om te vullen met directe tijd (GFI, rapporteren en inlezen, overdracht naar collega’s);
* De starttijd van de route binnen de dienst kan variëren. Soms begin je direct bij start van je dienst met de geplande klantzorg. Soms heb je eerst niet\-geplande tijd. Dat geeft veel flexibiliteit;
* Samen met je collega’s ben je verantwoordelijk voor de telefonische bereikbaarheid als onderdeel van je dienst;
* Je hoeft geen nachtdiensten te draaien;
* Je krijgt van ons een chromebook en smartphone in bruikleen.
* De functie verpleegkundige valt in de schaal FWG 45 conform de cao VVT. Afhankelijk van de ervaring die je meebrengt bepalen we de exacte hoogte van jouw salaris.

### **Introduction**


Are you eager to research and develop Visual Analytics techniques for Event Sequence exploration and analysis? Are you curious how to combine and explore the synergy between Visualization and Process Mining? In this project we aim to transform the way we analyze and visualize complex processes.

### **Job Description**


The field of process mining, a branch of business process management, revolves around discovering, analyzing, and optimizing business processes. It does so by extracting insights from event logs, structured records that capture sequences of activities, such as steps in a loan approval workflow, product purchases by customers, or patient journeys across hospitals. However, traditional process mining techniques focus primarily on control\-flow, which describes the chain of activities. This singular focus often neglects other dimensions of processes, such as the time between activities and the time required for specific steps, the spatial distribution of tasks across locations, or the intricate relationships between resources and attributes involved in the processes. For example, in a supply chain scenario, understanding delays, warehouse locations, and inventory attributes is crucial, but often omitted in basic control\-flow analysis. Process mining, as it stands today, is primarily based on computational techniques and algorithms to analyze and optimize processes. Methods such as process discovery, conformance checking, and performance analysis rely on algorithmic approaches to extract patterns, detect deviations, and identify inefficiencies from event logs. Although these techniques have proven effective in providing data\-driven insights, they often fail to use visualization as a powerful means of interpretation and communication. Most process mining tools provide static and linear representations, such as process models (DFGs, BPMN) or Gantt charts, which are primarily suited for experts familiar with these abstractions. This limited use of visualization overlooks the potential for dynamic, interactive visual tools that can make complex process data accessible to a broader audience, enabling intuitive exploration and deeper understanding of multi\-faceted process attributes, such as time, resources, and contextual dependencies and correlations.


In contrast, the field of visual analytics focuses on developing tools and techniques to support the interpretation of complex, multi\-dimensional data. It provides concepts and techniques to explore and analyze event sequences, allowing patterns and anomalies to emerge intuitively. For example, visualizations such as timelines, Sankey diagrams, or network diagrams make it possible to uncover dependencies and bottlenecks in event sequences. Despite their shared goal of deriving actionable insights from event sequence data, process mining and visual analytics have largely operated in parallel, leaving significant opportunities for synergy unexplored.


By integrating the two domains, process mining can benefit from visual analytics’ expertise in handling multi\-faceted data. Visualizations that incorporate temporal, spatial, and relational aspects can unlock deeper insights into processes. Conversely, visual analytics can leverage process mining techniques to enhance guidance and evaluation during data exploration. For instance, capturing event logs while users interact with visualization tools can provide valuable feedback to refine analytical techniques.


The challenge lies in merging these disciplines effectively, combining their strengths to fully realize the potential of multi\-faceted data for visual process analytics. This project tackles this open problem, aiming to create a unified framework that harmonizes these complementary fields, transforming the way we analyze and visualize complex processes.


In this project, the focus is on developing Visual Analytics techniques for event sequence exploration and analysis to enable Multi\-Faceted Visual Process Analytics. The project is performed within the Visualization cluster under the supervision of dr.ir. Stef van den Elzen and dr. Fernando Paulovich.


The visualization cluster (https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/visualization\-3\) at TU/e has a strong track record in visualization and visual analytics for high\-dimensional data. It has generated several award\-winning contributions at major visualization conferences (IEEE VIS, IEEE InfoVis, IEEE VAST, EuroVis); several successful start\-up companies (MagnaView – now UiPath and SynerScope); and a number of techniques that are used on a large scale worldwide.

### **Job Requirements**


We are looking for a candidate who meets the following requirements:

* You are enthusiastic about research in Visual Analytics, Event Sequence Visualization, and Process Mining.
* You have experience with or a strong background in Visualization or Visual Analytics. Preferably you finished a master’s in Computer Science, (Applied) Mathematics, or Electrical Engineering.
* Expertise in the field of Process Mining/Event Visualization is a plus but not mandatory.

==============================================================================================

#### **Job description**


Motion systems are used throughout the semiconductor and high\-tech industry for fast and extremely precise positioning in e.g. microscopes and chip production process. Motion system design unites structural mechanics and dynamics, electromagnetic actuation, sensing and control. To achieve optimal performance of these mechatronic systems, the AIDEAL project aims to develop a holistic AI\-based design framework capable of considering all these aspects in an integrated manner. A key part of this is the mechanical integration, i.e. the design of the structure that holds everything together and provides the necessary structural stiffness and dynamic behavior. With the availability of additive manufacturing, tremendous design freedom has been unlocked, which allows for radically new high\-performance structural designs. Additionally, advancements in computer vision and language modeling allow for designs from different domains and scales to transform the creativity of AI\-driven generative design models. The endless possibilities and high complexity of the design task exceed the capabilities of experienced human designers. For this reason, we have already successfully developed specific computational design methods based on topology optimization to generate superior mechanical designs. This project aims to develop a new generation of these computational design tools by enhancing them with AI concepts, with the aim to accelerate the design process even further and increase the diversity and optimality of the obtained designs. This PhD project will closely interact with two other PhD researchers that focus on the electromagnetic actuation system and the control design, as well as with a consortium of high tech companies supporting the AIDEAL project. The project plan includes the joint realization of full\-scale functional hardware demonstrator, for which this PhD project is responsible for the mechanical design methodology.

  


The intended starting date of this PhD position is October 1st, 2025\.

### **Job Description**


Generative artificial intelligence is disrupting many domains, including communication, education, and academic research. Recently, some companies and research initiatives have proposed that generative AI could – perhaps should – be used in healthcare, both for discovering new medical technologies and for patient treatment. In terms of research, generative AI can find trends and patterns in vast quantities of medical research, synthesising data and making new medical discoveries. In terms of improving medical care, LLMs have the potential to be integrated into the doctor\-patient relationship. They can summarise consultations, and offer ongoing medical advice, and independently provide mental health services.


Using LLMs and other kinds of generative AI in healthcare comes with serious ethical issues. The most challenging of these is privacy, but ethical issues also include: the ability of these technologies to generate misleading or unreliable information to healthcare practitioners, the emergence of “responsibility gaps” in the healthcare system, and issues of social and epistemic justice among different patients and users. Some of these ethical challenges are similar to risks in other domains, but the challenges of applying generative AI in healthcare potentially comes with distinct harms. Unreliable healthcare information can have devastating consequences, which may be magnified if the design of LLMs do not take the privacy of the highly sensitive data they deal with into account as well as issues of justice and responsibility.


This PhD will begin by examining the key ethical challenges of privacy, reliability, justice and responsibility, showing how these ethical risks can be minimised or mitigated. This will prepare the candidate to develop a new ethical framework that outlines how generative AI can be ethically deployed in various kinds of healthcare. The candidate can either choose to focus on how generative AI can be used in medical research or how LLMs can provide new tools for doctors and patients. The candidate will also be responsible for sharing ethical insights with the other partners in the MedGPT consortium (see below for details). Additionally, an interest in analysing the use of generative AI in healthcare from the perspective of philosophy of science or intercultural philosophy would be a plus, although not a requirement.

**Funding \& Institutional Embedding**


This PhD position is part of the *Medical GPT: Revolutionising Healthcare with Ethical AI* project (MedGPT). The candidate will be supervised by Matthew J. Dennis (TU/e), Vlasta Sikimić (TU/e), Filippo Santoni de Sio (TU/e), and they will be hosted by Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Philosophy \& Ethics Group. The candidate will be responsible for working with other stakeholders in the MedGPT project, and will be encouraged to collaborate with other researchers in the consortium.

**Philosophy \& Ethics Group**


TU/e’s Philosophy and Ethics (P\&E) group connects philosophy and ethics to emerging technologies and innovation. Researchers in the P\&E group primarily study innovative technologies and technology\-related problems in detail to enable empirically informed analyses that are meaningful to philosophers, researchers across disciplines, and other societal stakeholders. To do this, the group has established close interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers from groups in the TU/e School of Innovation Sciences, as well as with mechanical engineers, climate scientists, and archaeologists, among others. The group’s expertise covers a variety of philosophical sub\-disciplines, including applied ethics, normative ethics, meta\-ethics, philosophy of science and technology, and epistemology. More information about P\&E can be found here: https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research\-groups/innovation\-sciences/philosophy\-ethics

### **Job Requirements**

* A master’s degree (or an equivalent university degree) in philosophy or related discipline.
* A research\-oriented and impact\-orientated attitude.
* Ability to work as part of a team of researchers working on similar topics, but from different disciplines.
* Interested in collaborating with governmental, policy, and industry stakeholders.
* Fluent in spoken and written English.
* We particularly welcome applications from candidates belonging to groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in academia, including, but not limited to, women and ethnic minorities.

### **Conditions of Employment**

-------------------

**“Kunstmatige Intelligentie voor het waterbeheer in centraal Nederland”**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Kunstmatige Intelligentie (AI) is een techniek die sinds de jaren '50 wordt toegepast. De lancering van ChatGPT heeft gezorgd dat deze techniek in een enorme stroomversnelling is gekomen. Exemplarisch hiervoor is dat ChatGPT binnen 5 dagen al 1 miljoen gebruikers had terwijl een platform als Netflix hier 3\.5 jaar over deed.


Bij HDSR zijn we bezig met de ontwikkeling van een modern data platform met bijbehorende tooling. De aanwezigheid van deze centrale plek maakt het mogelijk om nieuwe technieken, zoals generatieve AI, te gaan ontwikkelen en testen. Recent is er een haalbaarheidsstudie over tooling voor Generative AI uitgevoerd, een zogenaamde Proof of Concept (PoC). De resultaten van deze studie hebben bijgedragen aan intern beleid om (generatieve) AI binnen de juiste kaders en volgens de juiste richtlijnen te gebruiken.


Een aanbeveling die er ligt om het gebruik van AI binnen de organisatie verder vorm te geven is om ***een interne AI\-werkgroep op te zetten***. Deze AI\-werkgroep faciliteert een centrale plek in de organisatie waar kennis over AI ingebracht en opgehaald kan worden, waar vragen kunnen worden gesteld en waar innovatieve ideeën op het gebied van AI uit kunnen worden gewisseld. Een onderdeel van deze stage is om mee te werken aan het opzetten van deze interne AI\-werkgroep.


Daarnaast zijn er nog ***legio andere mogelijke AI Use Cases*** die uitgevoerd kunnen worden. We genereren bijvoorbeeld documentatie over de objecten die het watersysteem reguleren en controleren (het beheerregister) binnen onze huidige administratieve\-, ingenieurs\- en waterbeheer\-werkzaamheden. Of er is in de werkvoorbereiding informatie nodig die intern en extern gedeeld kan worden. Naast deze onderwerpen zijn er ook nog andere toepassingsmogelijkheden, zoals bijvoorbeeld het omzetten van 2\-dimensionale naar van 3\-dimensionale tekeningen of het analyseren van dronebeelden om zwakke plekken in onze dijken te lokaliseren.


***In overleg met jou*** zullen we ***nog een onderwerp kiezen voor een PoC met generatieve AI***. Hierna zal een introductie volgen van de betrokken collega's om daarna de techniek in te duiken en te ontwikkelen. Er zullen regelmatig momenten voor feedback ingepland worden met de betrokken collega's uit de afdelingen en je zal dagelijkse begeleiding krijgen om te zorgen dat de te ontwikkelen producten ook voldoen aan de interne eisen. Hierbij kunnen verschillende werkmethodieken (bv. Agile, scrum, DevOps, Lean Six Sigma) aan bod komen die houvast geven, en waarvoor ruimte voor verdere verdieping is.


**In dit team kom je te werken**
--------------------------------


Je komt te werken in het Informatie \& Kennis (I\&K) team wat onderdeel is van Ontwikkeling, Strategie \& Advies (OSA). Binnen het I\&K team doen we wetenschappelijk en toegepast onderzoek. I\&K is een team dat focus heeft op de inhoud waarbij we vanuit de techniek ondersteund worden door de afdeling Informatievoorziening \& Automatisering (I\&A). Je dagelijkse begeleiding wordt gedaan door een medewerker uit het Team I\&K, vanuit de organisatorische kant word je begeleid door de I\&K teamleider.


**Waar kun je op rekenen?**
---------------------------


Ons waterschap is een interessante leeromgeving waarin je veel kennis en ervaring kunt opdoen. Daarnaast krijg jij:


* een stagevergoeding van € 500,00 bruto per maand op basis van 36 uur per week.
* een werkplek die goed bereikbaar is met het openbaar vervoer.
* goede stagebegeleiding, afgestemd op jouw behoeften en de vereisten vanuit jouw opleiding.
* niet zomaar een stage, maar een stage waarmee je écht verschil maakt.
* een stage die goed staat op je CV.
* de mogelijkheid om een netwerk op te bouwen binnen het Waterschap en daarmee binnen de publieke sector.
* de mogelijkheid om deel te nemen aan diverse uitjes en events, zoals teamdagen en bezoeken aan andere afdelingen.


**Wat maakt jou succesvol?**
----------------------------


Vind jij dat je een digital native bent en doe je een AI, data science of gerelateerde studie? Wil jij je cloud skills verder ontwikkelen en krijg je energie van het ontwikkelen, testen en kennisdeling?


Als je dan ook nog eens voor een periode van 5 maanden of langer, minimaal 32 uur per week beschikbaar bent voor je stage dan staan we open voor een gesprek!


**Ben je enthousiast?**
-----------------------


We zien je reactie graag tegemoet!

Deze afstudeeropdracht gaat over het overstijgen van traditionele app\-ontwikkeling door het gebruik van generatieve AI en chatbots. Je taak is het creëren van een chatbot die persoonlijke, reisgerelateerde vragen van reizigers beantwoordt, rekening houdend met privacy en toegankelijkheid. Dit project biedt een unieke kans om praktische ervaring op te doen in een snel evoluerend veld.**

**Interessegebieden:** Generative AI, Chatbots, Mobility, Accessibility


Deze afstudeeropdracht maakt onderdeel uit van het afstudeerproject Sustainable Public Integrated Transport Solution (SPITS). Met dit project zetten we ons in om voor reizigers de ideale reiservaring\-oplossing te bieden, het OV veel toegankelijker te maken en een stuk duurzamer.


Een routeplanner voor het openbaar vervoer moet inclusief zijn, geschikt voor alle leeftijden en toegankelijk voor mensen met beperkingen. Het implementeren van een routeplanner als mobiele app is slechts een van de mogelijke benaderingen. Het gebruik van een app brengt echter uitdagingen met zich mee, waaronder investeringen in ontwikkeling, testen, onderhoud en distributie. Bovendien moet een app geschikt worden gemaakt voor verschillende platformen, denk hierbij aan oude en nieuwe telefoons en verschillende besturingssystemen. Dit kost veel tijd en geld, resources die we ook anders kunnen inzetten om het OV toegankelijk en duurzaam te kunnen maken.


Met de opkomst van generatieve kunstmatige intelligentie komt de chatbot opnieuw in de schijnwerpers te staan. Het voordeel van chatbots is hun veelzijdigheid, waardoor ze eenvoudig kunnen worden geïntegreerd in diverse apparaten, zoals WhatsApp of spraakassistenten, zonder dat er direct een app aan te pas komt. Bovendien hebben deze slimme chatbots de capaciteit om gepersonaliseerde communicatie te bieden aan elke individuele reiziger, waardoor de toegankelijkheid van informatie wordt verbeterd.

**De opdracht**
---------------


Jij gaat aan de slag met het ontwikkelen en trainen van een chatbot in een proof of concept. Je maakt gebruik van reizigersdata uit publieke bronnen zoals TOMP. Tijdens het ontwikkelproces zul je je verplaatsen in de schoenen van een reiziger om deze nieuwe vorm van gebruikersinteractie te verkennen en de reiziger nog beter van dienst te kunnen zijn. Bij het ontwerpen van de chatbot moet je rekening houden met aspecten zoals privacy en toegankelijkheid, en je moet in staat zijn om de kwaliteit en toegankelijkheid continu te kunnen controleren.

Het maken en delen van podcasts en video’s kost echter best veel tijd. Hoe groot is het deel dat we in dit proces zouden kunnen automatiseren? Dat ga jij onderzoeken en vervolgens bouwen.**

**Interessegebieden:** Software development, Applied AI, Python, Generative AI


Het met passie opnemen van de kennis in een podcast en/of video’s is pas het begin. Na de opname zijn er veel handmatige en tijdsintensieve verwerkingen nodig om deze klaar te maken om te delen en promoten via social media platformen. Er is al een eerste aanzet gedaan voor het ontwikkelen van het Augmented Multimedia Platform (AMP) om delen hiervan te automatiseren. Denk hierbij het beschrijven van de opname (transcript), samenvatten, titel voorstellen, artikel creatie etc.


Maar dat is slechts het begin. Er zijn nog vele andere features die veel waarde kunnen toevoegen aan het platform. Denk hierbij automatische correctie van gastnamen in de transcript, het genereren van images en slides ter promotie, creatie van snippet (video/audio) als teaser etc. Hierna moet de content ook nog daadwerkelijk gedeeld worden, waarbij we via verschillende social media kanalen ruchtbaarheid geven aan de publicatie. Periodiek wordt de publicatie ook nog opnieuw gedeeld, waarbij we steeds andere quotes uit de opname halen.

**De opdracht**
---------------


Onderzoek welke passende technologieën er zijn om de uitdagingen van de audio/video verwerkingen en verrijkingen te automatiseren. Daarnaast wil je de gebruiker ondersteunen bij het delen van de content via social media kanalen. Bouw een Proof of Concept van de software oplossing voor de verrijking van de podcast/video content. Flexibiliteit, gebruiksvriendelijkheid en uitbreidbaarheid zijn van essentieel belang.


Onderzoeksvragen zijn afhankelijk vanuit jouw interesse en op basis van de features van de opdrachtgever. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn:

* Hoe kunnen visuele verrijkingen gemaakt worden voor de podcast op basis van transcriptie?
* Hoe kan het platform verrijkt worden met publicatie mogelijkheden en scheduling naar social media platformen?
* Hoe kan het platform doorontwikkeld worden naar multi user?
* Hoe kun je specifieke audio/video snippets creëren op basis van user input?
* Hoe kun je het platform uitbreiden met de auto correctie van podcast host en gast namen en biografieën?

De eerste versie van het AMP is ontwikkeld met onder andere Python \& Django en werkt onder andere met behulp van Whisper voor de transcriptie en ChatGPT\-4 voor de tekst modificatie. Deze opzet kan als basis gebruikt worden voor de PoC. De nieuwe features kunnen ook apart ontwikkeld worden om ze op een later moment te integreren.

**Robin.**  
**‍**Onze AI oplossing heet Robin. Robin zet gesprekken automatisch om in gestructureerde samenvattingen, waardoor behandelaren minder tijd kwijt zijn aan verslaglegging. Dit betekent dat een groot deel van de taken sneller en nauwkeuriger uitgevoerd kan worden, waardoor onze Scribes nog meer behandelaren kunnen ondersteunen. Robin is ontwikkeld samen met behandelaren, zodat het perfect aansluit op de praktijk en zorgverleners écht helpt.

De unieke template generator stelt behandelaren in staat hun eigen werkwijze te behouden. Daarnaast onderscheiden we ons door onze implementatie\- en adoptiekracht. Om Robin goed te laten landen op de werkvloer, zetten wij namelijk adoptie\-Scribes in, psychologiestudenten met ervaring als Scribe. Ze analyseren de werkwijze, installeren Robin en helpen bij het finetunen van gesprekstemplates.

**Onze missie – wat gaan we samen doen?**  
**‍**Het Scribe Collectief ondersteunt zorgverleners bij GGZ\-instellingen door de administratieve last te verlichten. De GGZ staat namelijk onder grote druk door de hoge administratielast en een tekort aan zorgverleners. Mensen met psychische klachten worden daardoor geregeld te laat geholpen, met alle gevolgen van dien. Het Scribe Collectief draagt met haar ruim 150 Scribes bij aan het verlichten van de administratieve lasten. Onze Scribes, psychologiestudenten die administratieve taken overnemen, zorgen al voor efficiëntere zorgprocessen, zodat zorgverleners betere zorg kunnen verlenen. Dit jaar hebben we een AI\-tool toegevoegd aan onze dienstverlening om een totaaloplossing te bieden voor de zorgorganisaties.

**Tech Lead**  
**‍**Als Tech Lead ben jij verantwoordelijk voor het door ontwikkelen en implementeren van Robin. Je werkt samen met ons team, Scribes én zorgprofessionals om ervoor te zorgen dat onze tool naadloos aansluit bij de behoeften van de behandelaren. Je bouwt verder aan een nieuwe digitale tak van het bedrijf en blijft door ontwikkelen met innovatieve oplossingen die de zorg toekomstbestendig maken.

Jouw kernmissie is de technische ontwikkeling van Robin en het neerzetten van de infrastructuur die nodig is om op te schalen. Daarnaast ben je verantwoordelijk voor het in kaart brengen en compliance van de wet\- en regelgeving. Tot slot, draag je bij aan de adoptie van de tool, zodat deze ook daadwerkelijk gebruikt wordt.

Het gaat hier bijvoorbeeld om het onttrekken van informatie uit specificaties met Natural Language Processing, het genereren van testdata en tests en de validatie van API’s ten opzichte van hun specificatie. Nieuwsgierig? Lees dan vooral verder.**

**Interessegebieden:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), Language Understanding, Code Generation, OpenAPI Specification, Testing


Deze afstudeeropdracht maakt onderdeel uit van het afstudeerproject Sustainable Public Integrated Transport Solution (SPITS). Met dit project zetten we ons in om voor reizigers de ideale reiservaring\-oplossing te bieden, het OV veel toegankelijker te maken en een stuk duurzamer.


De TOMP\-werkgroep heeft tot doel om een internationaal beheerde, interoperabele open standaard voor technische communicatie tussen vervoerders en MaaS\-aanbieders te ontwikkelen en in stand te houden door middel van definitie, verbetering, afstemming en verspreiding. Een uitdaging bij deze API\-standaard is dat openbaar vervoerders (PTO’s) het vervoer op heel verschillende manieren faciliteren.


Denk bijvoorbeeld aan:

* werken met dienstregelingen
* reizen op aanvraag, zoals taxi’s of bussen
* deelbare scooters


Er kunnen dus heel verschillende implementaties van de API’s zijn die zich anders gedragen dan je zou verwachten op basis van de OpenAPI\-documentatie die door TOMP naar voren is gebracht. Maar hoe valideer je een TOMP API\-implementatie met AI met als resultaat, of score, hoe goed de implementatie zich gedraagt ten opzichte van de specificatie.

**De opdracht**
---------------


Tijdens deze afstudeeropdracht ga je onderzoeken of en hoe we AI kunnen gebruiken om een API te testen op basis van een OpenAPI\-specificatie. Dit hoeft dus niet noodzakelijk een TOMP API te zijn.

* Gebruik Natural Language Processing (NLP) om relevante informatie uit API\-specificaties te extraheren.
* Genereer testdata voor de API’s (bijvoorbeeld op basis van andere open standaarden).
* Genereer automatische tests voor de API’s door de geëxtraheerde API\-informatie te combineren met de gegenereerde testdata.
* Valideer de conformiteit van de geteste API met de bestaande API\-specificatie.

**Interessegebieden:** Artificial Intelligence, Schermleessoftware


In onze digitale wereld is het essentieel dat websites toegankelijk zijn voor iedereen, inclusief mensen met visuele beperkingen zoals blinden en slechtzienden. Het is van groot belang om websites te bouwen die voldoen aan toegankelijkheidsnormen. Het correct gebruiken van valide heading tags en het goed structureren van menu’s zijn cruciaal om een duidelijke en functionele gebruikerservaring te bieden. Helaas blijven veel websites ontoegankelijk voor deze doelgroep vanwege het gebrek aan implementatie van dergelijke toegankelijkheidsmaatregelen.


Een groot probleem doet zich voor zelfs als ontwikkelaars de toegankelijkheidsrichtlijnen volgen en de juiste code implementeren. Gebruikers met visuele beperkingen ervaren vaak niet direct voordeel. Dit komt omdat zij afhankelijk zijn van schermleessoftware die de website\-inhoud omzet in spraak. De huidige benadering concentreert zich vooral op het interpreteren van de achterliggende code en het vertalen ervan naar gebruikersvriendelijke code die voldoet aan toegankelijkheidsrichtlijnen.

**De opdracht**
---------------


Ontwikkel en implementeer een geavanceerde oplossing die de digitale toegankelijkheid voor gebruikers met visuele beperkingen aanzienlijk verbetert. Het doel is om door middel van analyses, algoritmes en een deel AI een effectieve oplossing te creëren.


De kern van dit project is de tool zelf, die HTML kan analyseren en transformeren. Dit maakt het beter leesbaar voor schermleessoftware. Je start met een diepgaand onderzoek naar de interpretatie van websites door schermleessoftware en de huidige tekortkomingen in bestaande repositories met betrekking tot toegankelijkheidsrichtlijnen.


Dit onderzoek dient als ondersteuning voor de ontwikkeling van de tool. Het zal ons inzicht geven in de specifieke aanpassingen die nodig zijn om de huidige code te transformeren naar een formaat dat voldoet aan strikte toegankelijkheidsrichtlijnen. Zodra de tool gereed is, kunnen we deze inzetten via Azure Pipelines. Zo kan de geschreven code van developers getransformeerd worden tot code die voldoet aan de toegankelijkheidsrichtlijnen. Dit zorgt voor een efficiënte en continue verbetering van de digitale toegankelijkheid.

Dat is je opdracht. Om te kunnen controleren of unit tests, integratietests en data quality tests echt werken.**

**Interessegebieden:** Data \& AI, Azure Modern Data Architectures, .NET



In een modern cloud data platform, worden soms grote hoeveelheden data geladen, getransformeerd en gedistribueerd. Dit gebeurt over diverse soorten data stores, waaronder relationele databases, maar ook ongestructureerde stores zoals data lakes of document databases.


In de data pipelines die worden gebouwd binnen zo’n platform, worden steeds meer technieken gebruikt om de data te laden, te transformeren en weer op te slaan, waaronder SQL scripts, maar ook Python scripts, Machine Learning modellen of propriatary cloud ETL tools, zoals Azure Data Factory.


Maar hoe weet je nu of dit soort data pipelines correct werken? En of de steeds groter wordende data stores nog wel consistente en betrouwbare data bevatten? Dit zijn vragen waar jij mee aan de slag gaat.

**De opdracht**
---------------


We scopen deze opdracht op een modern data platform gebouwd met Microsoft Azure componenten, waaronder

* Azure Storage
* Azure Data Factory
* Azure SQL Database
* Azure Databricks


Voor een dergelijk data platform onderzoek je welke mogelijkheden er zijn voor unit tests, integratietests en data quality tests, allen onderdeel van CI/CD pipelines. Voor een aantal tests ontbreekt vrijwel zeker goede ondersteuning binnen de gebruikte tools en zal er iets bedacht moeten worden om toch te kunnen testen of het data platform goed werkt. Ook dit is onderdeel van je opdracht.


Aan het eind van je opdracht, heb je een zo volledig mogelijk testframework uitgedacht voor een modern Azure data platform en heb je een deel daarvan geïmplementeerd als bewijs dat het framework werkt.
