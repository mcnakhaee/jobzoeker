For that, you will have the opportunity to travel to some of our hub and distribution locations to practically witness the operation and contributing as a problem solver using GenAI or other AI/ML techniques. Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to preempt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

Translational research leverages real-world data sets to study how patients respond to cancer treatments. This research often involves integrating complex and non-standardized molecular and clinical data. Clinical datasets, designed to answer specific scientific questions, typically lack detailed data granularity, making exploration challenging. Understanding the clinical data model is crucial to selecting the appropriate variables for analysis.
This project proposes the use of graph databases to overcome these challenges by organizing data into a flexible, multidimensional structure that facilitates easier access and more intuitive querying. Graph databases, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, allow for the discovery of implicit relationships within the data that traditional table-based databases might miss. Through this initiative, we aim to develop and evaluate AI-driven querying techniques using natural language, enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets in translational research.
Responsibilities* Technology Exploration: Investigate various graph database technologies and their applicability to managing clinical data, assessing their strengths and limitations in this domain.
* Data Model Comparison: Compare and analyze the data structures of graph and relational databases to identify the most effective frameworks for clinical data.
* Pilot Database Development: Design and implement a prototype database focused on the standardization of clinical real-world data, ensuring it supports robust data integration and access.
* Natural Language Query Development: Create methods to enable querying of graph databases using natural language, employing advanced AI technologies to facilitate intuitive data interactions.
* Findings Presentation: Regularly present progress and insights during team meetings, ensuring clear communication of developments and challenges.
* Bonus Objective: Develop a user interface that enables easy querying, and effective visualization and presentation of results from the database.


Requirements* Education: You are a BSc/MSc student in bioinformatics, computational biology or a related field.
* Technical skills: Demonstrated strong technical skills, with substantial experience in Python programming. Familiarity with AWS is an added advantage.
* Soft skills: Comfortable with pioneering research and creative processes; scientific thinking and connecting that to technical requirements.


About You* You are passionate about our purpose and genuinely care about our mission to transform the lives of patients through innovative cancer treatment
* You bring rigor and excellence to all that you do. You are a fierce believer in our rooted-in-science approach to problem-solving
* You are a generous collaborator who can work in teams with diverse backgrounds
* You are determined to do and be your best and take pride in enabling the best work of others on the team

Within the team Sustainable Forest Ecosystems (SFE) of Wageningen Environmental Research (WENR), there is a need to expand capacity for research into monitoring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF).  

  

While the team’s main focus is on forests we also conduct research into the role of land use and forest management in greenhouse gas emissions and removals in a broader context involving the whole LULUCF sector, including other land uses. Team members are responsible for the compilation of the national greenhouse gas inventory for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. For this we develop and work with geographically explicit instruments (such as models and monitoring) that can be used to determine the effects of the management or change in land use of forests, cropland, grasslands, wetlands, settlements and other land. We closely collaborate with other experts on land use and soil at Wageningen Environmental Research and external research institutes to bring together all required information for the LULUCF monitoring.  

  

We use our knowledge and tools to draw up the international (Climate Convention, Paris Agreement, EU) and national (Climate and Energy Outlook) reports of greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the LULUCF sector in the Netherlands. With our science-based expertise we also support the development and evaluation of climate policy of the Dutch government and European Commission.

Read the 5 reasons why your future colleagues enjoy working at WUR and watch the video below to get an idea of our green campus!

**Omschrijving**
----------------


The Soil Physics and Land Management chair group at Wageningen University and Research is seeking a postdoc researcher in hydrological modelling who will be responsible for the numerical modelling work in project RESTARTIN: “Restructuring and enhancing strategies with a transformative approach for integrated water disaster management in India and the Netherlands”. This work will involve not only the modelling itself, but also the use of high-resolution satellite imagery to assess vegetation water conditions for calibration, the design of land-use change scenarios (eventually with modelling), and interactions with stakeholders and socioeconomic researchers to translate potential adaptation options into practice.  

Your duties and responsibilities include:

+ apply a surface and groundwater model to several regions in the Netherlands (Limburg, Brabant and Holland);
+ assess climate change scenarios and design compatible land-use scenarios;
+ assess the impact of climate change on flood and drought conditions;
+ test potential adaptation options in coordination with stakeholders;
+ some involvement in related educational activities is possible.
**You will work here**  

You will work in project RESTARTIN, jointly funded by NWO and DST-India. Most of the work will be developed within the Soil Physics and Land Management chair group in WUR. But it will be closely coordinated with researchers at IHE-Delft working on detailed risk assessment and socioeconomic analysis. It will also be closely linked with similar activities being performed by Indian researchers in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra. Some travelling to India is therefore expected.


The intended starting date of this position is 1 September 2024.

**Functie-eisen**
-----------------


You hold a PhD degree in hydro(geo)logy, environmental sciences or equivalent. You also possess:

+ strong and broad conceptual and methodological knowledge of hydrology at the soil-water-plant and watershed scales, including relevant numerical models (e.g., HEC-HMS/RAS, SWMM, HBV, SWAT, SHE, VIC, MODFLOW, CATHY, HGS, FEFLOW, DSSAT, etc.), and model calibration/validation techniques;
+ in-depth experience with GIS packages (e.g., ArcGIS, Qgis) and advanced data analysis techniques;
+ in-depth experience with scripting in R, MATLAB, Python, FORTRAN, etc.;
+ experience in scientific writing, conducting research, and a publication record in hydrology;
+ ability to work independently and to take ownership of the assigned tasks, including making independent decisions on implementation details.

Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”



Unique to this job  

We are an international, dynamic, highly motivated team of scientists at different stages of our careers with a strong drive to push research for the benefit of Public Health.

We know what it takes to lead UPS into tomorrow, – people with a unique combination of skills and passion. If you have the qualities and drive to lead yourself then this role will help you to cultivate your skills and take you to the next level. As a part of the internship, you will have opportunity to learn and develop the following business cases:

**Document Indexing (DOCIDX)**


Indexing scanned documents based on an embedded barcode of any type like CODE39, QR... is essential for any later processing, such as storage and retrieval, distribution to other departments or customer, and other back-office processing. We would like you to work on creating a reusable interface to index scanned documents in bulk, easily customizable for any environment and task.

**Package Type Detection (PKGDCT)**


UPS operates a large number of automated package-processing facilities. Not all packages processed have the perfect cube shape and size. We need to detect the shape of the packages (e.g., envelope, regular box, big size, irregular…) so that they are processed with the care required for each type, or even detect warning conditions like broken packages or liquid leaks.

**Job Description:**

Each case will require a different set of tools and algorithms to be applied. Which ones will you use? And why will you discard others? These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to pre-empt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

We are the leading one-stop-shop for branded payments, making online recharge possible for anyone, anywhere at any time — whether you or someone you love needs credit for calling, gaming, entertainment or money. This is your chance to join an ambitious scaleup in a state of rapid growth; we’ll push you to develop yourself and help you create a real impact in your role. Put simply: we could write history together.

  

We won’t bore you with a corporate spiel about how we might be taking on the world of branded payments (spoiler: we are).



Instead, we’ll let the numbers speak for themselves: we bring consumers their favourite brands to their fingertips, with over 15,000 products available in every gift card category globally, $70 million in funding (and counting!), 20%+ growth in 2023.

  

We also have a revenue target of €75 million in 2024, we're just getting started with 1.1 million app downloads in 2023, we are counting 5.0+ million active customers, a presence in 180 countries and 25 markets, a team of 150+ employees and 40+ nationalities and 1 person missing — you.

We’re looking for a talented Business Analyst to join our Business Intelligence Team reporting to Nicolas Arrivé. You will work on improving our day to day business with a strong focus on our customers and marketing analytics.

We help the Marketing team in being more efficient with their Marketing spend in acquiring the right customers. We also inform our product and engineering teams in optimising the users experience from discovery to purchases in app and on the web.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-------------------


Join us – we look forward to welcoming you to our Self-Organizing Soft Matter Research Group at Eindhoven University of Technology!


We are seeking a highly motivated Postdoctoral Researcher with a passion for quantitative microscopy and physical chemistry of self-assembling materials to join our team to image the behavior of ice-interactive biomaterials on ice with single-molecule resolution. The goal of your project is to develop and use state-of-the-art microscopy tools and quantitative image analysis approaches to discover the physical principles underpinning the activity of novel ice-interactive biomaterials and to tune their interaction with ice to modulate activity as desired.


Key Responsibilities:


* Conduct high-quality, curiosity-driven, original, and independent research focusing on quantitative imaging and super-resolution microscopy of self-assembling materials
* Collaborate with a multi-disciplinary and international team of researchers
* Present research findings at conferences and publish in top-tier scientific journals
* Mentor and support junior researchers in the lab


The formation and growth of ice during freezing, storage, and/or thawing of cryopreserved materials limits the potential of cryopreservation technology for the long-term storage of sensitive materials, such as cells, tissues, and organs. Our group aims to unravel how biological and engineered ice-interactive materials function so that we can create customized chemical cryoprotectants for biomedical and other applications. Recently, we reported sub-zero super-resolution microscopy experiments which allowed us to study for the first time the interfacial dynamics of ice-bound ice-binding proteins at the single molecule level (see PNAS publication for more information). In this project you will build upon these pioneering experiments. You will image the interaction with ice of a novel class of engineered ice-interactive materials at the single molecule level to advance our understanding of how their structure and properties impact their ability to modulate ice crystal formation and growth. In this exciting role, you will work in a vibrant and international research group aiming to advance molecular insight into the working mechanism of novel ice-interactive materials for biomedical applications.

Are you an ambitious bioinformatician with a solid background in omics data analysis and experience in the field of immunology and/or infectious disease research? Then this bioinformatician position is the job for you!



Within our Center for Immunology of Infectious diseases and Vaccines we perform research on how vaccinations or infections protect against viruses and bacteria. We investigate the immunity gained after vaccination and/or infection with a special focus on the vulnerable groups in our society such as children and elderly. To this end, the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens are investigated. We use multiple ""omics"" approaches to characterize cellular immune responses in detail, in order to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease.



What are you going to do?  

You will be involved in multiple projects aimed at understanding the immune response to vaccination and infection. You will be responsible for analyzing (multi)-omic (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq and TCR-seq) data from clinical studies and in vitro models, and will be integrating the outcomes with other (immunological) data. For this, you design and implement computational pipelines that allows answering specific questions related to immunology of infectious diseases and vaccines, such as identification of potential biomarkers related to immune protection. Within this process you incorporate robust statistical analysis. Finally you will visualize the data into ‘state of the art’ figures. Your role will involve:


* setting up the infrastructure from sequencing platforms to data analysis for multiple omics approaches (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.);
* being responsible for the analysis, processing and storage of large datasets conform best practices for ensuring analytical reproducibility;
* performing down-stream data analysis of multi-omic research data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, proteomics, etc.), to integrate the outcomes with other clinical data, and report findings;
* supporting data analysis for different projects within the department and training others to use basic pipelines
* contribute to academic research publications in collaboration with other team members.


About your team  

Your department Immune Mechanisms – Correlate of Protection investigates the immune mechanisms that protect us against disease caused by human pathogens. The research is focused on characterizing cellular immune responses in detail, both the innate arm, as well as the adaptive arm. In various research projects we aim to obtain biomarkers or immune profiles that correlate to protection against disease. You will be part of an enthusiastic team of (senior) scientists, research technicians and data scientists working on immunology. This allows you to work a wide variety of readily available datasets that you will bring together to answer important and relevant public health questions. One of our data scientist, dr. Sara Suarez: ""I value the opportunity for exploring diverse topics in vaccine immunology in close collaboration with lab-technicians and scientists responsible for the different projects. Also, I truly enjoy learning and troubleshooting alongside our growing team of talented data scientists and the flexibility to work from home and on-site.”



Unique to this job  

We are an international, dynamic, highly motivated team of scientists at different stages of our careers with a strong drive to push research for the benefit of Public Health.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

In this role you can apply your knowledge of analyzing and interpreting HR- and employee-data in a variety of ways.

  

This role divides its time between the Product Development and Consulting with separate but overlapping responsibilities. Formally you will be part of the Data Team, that is part of Product Development.  



  

The role of Data Analyst has 3 areas of responsibility:


**Product Development (50%)**

  


Collaborating with our data scientist, you will develop data-driven enhancements for our products and services, leveraging our data in innovative ways.

Although we do not actively offer custom data analyses to customers, around 30 enterprise customers per year request custom analyses based on our research, sometimes in combination with their own data. This sometime involves doing an intake with the customer and possibly also an explanation of the findings.

Are you interested? Keep reading and apply at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam!


Understanding the population structure of (sub)species is crucial for both wildlife conservation and effective population management of back-up populations in zoos, given the potential harm hybridization poses to the reintroduction potential of zoo animals. The red panda (*Ailurus fulgens*) is an endangered mammal with only 2,500 to 10,000 individuals in the wild. Debate is ongoing whether the species should be split into two distinct species: *Ailurus fulgens fulgens* and *Ailurus fulgens styani.* This project aims to assess the genetic health of the worldwide zoo population and determine the taxonomic origin of its founders. Additionally, the candidate will explore genomic compatibility between populations to predict the potential effect of hybridization. In collaboration with the international studbook keeper of the red panda zoo population, based at Rotterdam zoo, we will use long- and short read whole genome sequence data from key individuals from the zoo population with an additional reference dataset of re-sequenced wild individuals. This project will develop a genomics-informed framework for conservation and reintroduction of red pandas, and could potentially set a new standard for the field of conservation genomics.


The successful applicant will bring together the expertise of Dr. Mirte Bosse, who is in the forefront of the exciting new field of conservation genomics, and Janno Weerman, who is the international studbook keeper of the worldwide zoo population of red pandas. The PhD candidate will be embedded in the Ecology&Evolution group at the VU in close collaboration with Rotterdam Zoo and the Animal Breeding and Genomics group of Wageningen University. The candidate will have the opportunity to frequently work from Rotterdam Zoo, and will engage in a research network with international academic partners, zoos and NGOs.


**Your duties**


* develop a high-quality reference genome for each red panda (sub)species using nanopore technologies
* explore structural genomic differences between populations by combining de novo assemblies with long and short reads
* perform population genomics analyses on re-sequenced animals to better understand population structure in situ and ex situ
* analyze genetic load in the zoo population in comparison with the wild, and develop framework to implement this information in the breeding programme
* developing a framework for decision-making on planned reintroductions based on genomic information.
* authoring and co-authoring manuscripts submitted to high quality journals
* provide support to teaching of the section (<10% of your time)
* frequently present your work at internal and external (national or international) meetings, and to non-academic stakeholders


**Your profile**
----------------

* MSc in one of the following fields: Biology, Genetics, Animal Breeding, Conservation sciences and/or Bioinformatics, or a related field
* you should have at least experience with bioinformatics and genomics (details below):
* experience (or affinity) with programming in Python, R, bash
* experience (or affinity) with next- and third generation sequencing technology such as Illumina, PacBio or Oxford Nanopore and some experience with downstream analysis of sequence data
* experience with the red panda model system is an advantage, but not necessary
* a good ability to speak, write and read English
* affinity with outreach activities and working in an international multidisciplinary team

The Faculty of Science and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) are looking for:

**PhD candidate | Environmental impact assessment of pollution at the ecosystem level (0.8-1.0 fte)**

**Vacancy number: (14994)**


**Background**


The freshwater system and its adjacent ecosystems host countless species because of their need of water. These are the earths’ natural capital and drivers of many ecosystem services we humans depend on. At the same time, the presence and effects of anthropogenic stress in the aquatic environment are multitude and ubiquitous. These include the omnipresence of chemical pollution such as the use of agricultural chemicals.


To relatively quickly assess the impacts of chemicals a standard risk assessment framework is in place. While valuable, the frameworks often lacks ecological realism. Researchers from Leiden University therefore experiment in outdoor freshwater experimental systems with natural food webs such as the “Levend Lab” (EN: “Living Lab”, https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/livinglab) to identify how biodiversity responds to the impacts of pesticides, fertilizers, invasive species and nanomaterials.


Using ecological theory, a large array of different experimental and statistical analytical methods are currently in practice to perform and analyze such experiments. The key challenge for the PhD candidate is to test these different forms of experimental and statistical analytical methods to identify stressor - ecosystem function relationships. The research will likely entail measuring different forms of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functionality followed by statistical modelling to infer causality of stressor impacts and their propagation through the ecosystem.


We invite prospective candidates to unravel the intricate network of species interactions between each other and their environment. The candidate will use new analytical methods and develops models and interpretation scenarios to identify how pollution impacts species and their role in ecosystem functionality.

**Key tasks:**

* *Perform* mesocosm pollution experiments in the ‘Levend Lab’ facility of Leiden University
* *Further develop* and test different types of statistical analyses at the community to ecosystem level
* *Advance* ecological theory by identifying the anthropological and natural drivers of species and their roles in ecosystems

**Selection criteria:**

* You should have an M.Sc. in a relevant field (environmental science, biology, ecology and/or ecotoxicology), but we also consider candidates from other related scientific fields.
* Experience with experimental field and laboratory skills and (aquatic) organism identifications are highly valued
* Strong background and interest in statistical analyses, data management, visualization and coding skills (in R, but Python also applies) is highly valued.
* You must be proficient in spoken and written English.
* You are a team player and have a collaborative attitude.


**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,800 staff and almost 6,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 150 FTE (including postdocs and PhD candidates) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

We offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 4 years based on performance. Salary ranges from € 2.770 gross per month in the first year to € 3.539 gross per month in the fourth year based on a full-time position (pay scale P in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities).


Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development and sabbatical leave. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break.


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website. Female researchers are also welcomed to join the Researchers In Science for Equality network of the Faculty if Science (rise.nu).

### **Functie inhoud**


De dringende en complexe sociale uitdagingen van onze tijd vragen om convergentie; de samenwerking tussen verschillende instellingen en disciplines om nieuwe perspectieven en oplossingen te creëren. Daarom bundelen TU Delft, Erasmus MC en Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam hun krachten in Convergence. Binnen het convergentiethema Health & Technology vormen we nieuwe kaders die wetenschappelijke ontdekkingen en technologische innovatie in gezondheid en gezondheidszorg bevorderen. Dit doen we door te werken aan baanbrekend onderzoek en innovatie gebundeld in 10 internationaal toonaangevende onderzoeks flagships.  

  

Het flaghship PROTECt ME (Proactive Technology-supported Prevention and Mental Health in Adolescence) richt zich op het mentale welzijn van jongeren. Je komt te werken binnen de afdeling Kinder-en Jeugdpsychiatrie/psychologie van het Erasmus MC, een van de toonaangevende partners van het flaghship PROTECt ME. De missie van dit programma is het optimaliseren van het welzijn van alle jongeren, door deze problemen proactief aan te pakken, van genezing naar zorg te gaan, en emotionele problemen op te sporen voordat ze de kop opsteken en levens negatief beïnvloeden.  

  

Als promovendus ga je werken aan het beter identificeren van dynamische risicofactoren van emotionele problemen met behulp van geavanceerde realtime maatregelen, smartphone- en draagbare technologie en datamodellering. Onderdeel van dit project is het opzetten en uitvoeren van een nieuw onderzoek onder adolescenten met behulp van diverse innovatieve eHealth instrumenten. Je begeleid een team studenten dat aan dit nieuwe onderzoek werkt. Samenwerking binnen ons multidisciplinaire team met clinici, datawetenschappers, industrieel ontwerp, machine learning en AI-experts zal van cruciaal belang zijn om onze doelen te bereiken.  

  

Over PROTECt ME:  

Maatschappelijk probleem. 13-25% van de Nederlandse jongeren (12-25 jaar) lijdt aan depressie of angst. Dergelijke mentale gezondheidsproblemen hebben langdurige negatieve gevolgen, waaronder schooluitval, een slechtere lichamelijke gezondheid en een grotere ongelijkheid. Mentale gezondheidsproblemen kosten de Nederlandse samenleving jaarlijks 2 miljard euro. Adequate en tijdige identificatie en behandeling zijn momenteel onmogelijk vanwege lange wachtlijsten, tijdrovende monitoringprocedures en het gebrek aan gepersonaliseerde, proactieve preventiestrategieën. Daarom zijn systematische veranderingen in onze benadering van de geestelijke gezondheidszorg voor jongeren hard nodig.  

  

Wetenschappelijke ambitie: Het welzijn van Nederlandse jongeren van 12 tot 25 jaar optimaliseren door:


* (WP 1) het verbeteren van de vroege identificatie van mentale gezondheidsproblemen, met behulp van geavanceerde realtime maatregelen, smartphone- en draagbare technologie, en datamodellering;
* (WP 2) het verbeteren van de besluitvorming over wie welke interventie nodig heeft en wanneer, door professionele expertise te combineren met kunstmatige intelligentie;
* (WP 3) het creëren en evalueren van nieuwe technologiegedreven proactieve interventies (bijv. eHealth). Onze geïntegreerde aanpak betrekt belanghebbenden en eindgebruikers bij elke stap (WP 4)

  
### **Werkomgeving**


De afdeling Kinder- en Jeugdpsychiatrie/Psychologie van het Erasmus MC/Sophia is met circa tweehonderd medewerkers de enige onafhankelijke universitaire kinder- en jeugdpsychiatrische afdeling in Nederland met eigen onderzoekslijnen en hoogleraren gevestigd in een kinderziekenhuis.

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!



One very important note….don't hold back! Even if you think you don't meet 100% of the criteria listed in this job role, we still encourage you to apply. We believe that everyone should have equal access to opportunities and want to ensure we provide an inclusive experience, so do let us know if there is anything else we can do to support your application process.

----------------


Are you passionate about investigating workforce challenges from the perspective of psychology, health sciences and medicine? Are you interested in applying these disciplines in clarifying risks of physicians’ stress to their work performance in providing patient care? If so, we invite you to join our team as a PhD student to unravel the impact of job demands, job resources and physicians’ work stress on diagnostic errors in emergency medicine.


**Job description**
-------------------


Emergency medicine physicians see patients who urgently need care. One of their key tasks is to determine the severity of the situation and identify possible diagnoses. This diagnostic process is challenged by diseases with variable presentations, while emergency physicians deal with interruptions and time pressure in a stressful work environment. This environment is characterized by abundant job demands (e.g. workloads) – and a lack of job resources (e.g. perceived support). Prolonged exposure to such demands and (lack of) resources increases work stress. This is especially problematic as excessive work stress hinders physicians in performing well in providing care, yet it is unknown how the diagnostic process specifically is affected. Therefore, there is a knowledge gap on whether and how stressed physicians exposed to excessive job demands and limited resources are more likely to commit more diagnostic errors.


This knowledge gap is addressed in the current PhD trajectory, by clarifying how job demands and resources, and work stress affect physicians’ diagnostic performance in emergency medicine. Your primary task as a PhD student involves conducting scientific research together with your supervisory team. This involves coordinating the data collection of studies and performing data analyses. Furthermore, you will be tasked with the writing of scientific articles, which will culminate into your PhD thesis. In addition to research tasks, you will have the opportunity to enrol in relevant courses that align with both the project requirements and your personal academic interests and you will be able to teach in our Bachelor Health Sciences and/or Master Health Care Management.


The research is a collaboration of the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management (ESHPM) and the Erasmus MC.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* A research master or master degree in psychology, health sciences, human resource studies, (interdisciplinary) social sciences or a related discipline.
* Interest in (occupational health) psychology, health care quality and the work environment of physicians.
* Strong analytical and research skills.
* Experience with quantitative research and statistical analyses, including computer skills (e.g. SPSS, Stata, SAS or R)
* Interest in qualitative research
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English and preferably also Dutch.
* You should be able to work both independently and as a member of a large multidisciplinary team (psychologists, sociologists, health scientists, physicians).


**Employment conditions and benefits**
--------------------------------------


We offer you an internationally oriented and varied job in an enthusiastic team, with excellent working conditions in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU).


The start date of this position is 1 October 2024 (or in mutual agreement) and you will be basedat at campus Woudestein at Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM). This position is for 1 fte. The salary ranges from a minimum of € 2.770 to a maximum of € 3.539 gross per month Scale PhD on a fulltime basis (38 hours), in accordance with the CAO-NU. The contract is entered into for the duration of 1.5 year, which will be extended with a second term of 2.5 years if the candidate performs well.


Everything else we offer you, you can find below!


* Everything you need for a **good work-life balance**: the option to work from home in consultation with your manager, 41 days of paid leave with a 40 hour contract, 8% holiday pay and an 8.3% end-of-year bonus, and a significant discount on a subscription for our on-campus sports centre!


* **Sustainable, inclusive and diverse work environment** with an open culture, where you can be yourself and we pay attention to each other and to the world around us. Make the most of our bicycle budget, or join networks such as Young@EUR, FAME or QuEUR.


* Time and space for your development in the broadest sense: development days and a personal career budget and free access to our university library.


* Good pension with ABP that EUR contributes 2/3rds towards, discounts on various collective insurances with Zilveren Kruis Achmea, Loyalis, and Allianz, and compensation for travel, working from home and home internet use.


* Are you currently combining your job with parenthood, or do you want to do so in the future? EUR offers partially paid parental leave and fully paid additional birth leave for partners, and our campus features a daycare (daycare not paid for by EUR).


* Moving to the Netherlands for your job with EUR? Then you may be eligible for the 30%-ruling if you meet the requirements of the Belastingdienst (Dutch tax agency), and with our Dual Career Programme we will also help your partner find the right job for them.

**De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie!**

**Wie zoeken wij?**

Voor ons hoofdkantoor in Amersfoort zoeken wij per direct een AI Solutions Developer.

In deze rol ben je verantwoordelijk voor het verkennen en implementeren van de mogelijkheden van generative AI, zoals ChatGPT, om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren.

Je hebt een relevante WO-opleiding afgerond of bijna afgerond, zoals Informatica of Data Science, en beschikt over aantoonbare kennis en interesse op het gebied van AI, machine learning en data-analyse. Daarnaast heb je sterke analytische vaardigheden en ben je in staat om complexe technische problemen op te lossen. Ervaring met programmeertalen zoals Python, R of Java is een vereiste, evenals kennis van cloud computing en ervaring met platforms zoals AWS, Azure of Google Cloud.

Goede communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief samen te werken in een team zijn van essentieel belang. Je bent proactief, leergierig en kunt goed omgaan met veranderingen en uitdagingen. Daarnaast heb je een sterke drive om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen op het gebied van AI en ICT-management.

**Wat ga je doen?**

Deze functie is nieuw binnen Lab21, wat betekent dat je een grote invloed hebt op de invulling ervan. Je zult een onderzoek uitvoeren naar de mogelijkheden van ChatGPT om de bedrijfsprocessen van Lab21 verder te automatiseren. Als Junior ICT Manager speel je een belangrijke rol bij het implementeren en beheren van AI-oplossingen binnen ons bedrijf. Je werkt nauw samen met verschillende teams om de behoeften van de organisatie in kaart te brengen en technologische oplossingen aan te dragen. Je analyseert en optimaliseert bestaande systemen en processen en identificeert kansen om AI-technologieën toe te passen.

**Plaats in de organisatie:**

Je zult rechtstreeks rapporteren aan de directie en een strategische rol vervullen bij het bespreken van automatiseringsvraagstukken en de mogelijkheden die verdere automatisering biedt om de marktpositie van Lab21 te versterken, zowel op het gebied van processen, commercie en marketing.

Als deze uitdagende rol je aanspreekt en je voldoet aan de gestelde eisen, nodigen we je van harte uit om te solliciteren.

**What is more:**

In deze positie ontvang je niet alleen een regulier salaris, maar ook een landmarkbonus voor elk succesvol afgerond project.

**Wat is LAB21?**

Lab21 is de snelst groeiende omnichannel speler in de Nederlandse woninginrichtingsmarkt, met 15 winkels. Ons streven is om onze klanten een combinatie van vakspecialistische service en betaalbare prijzen te bieden. Als moderne retailorganisatie leggen we sterk de nadruk op het bieden van online ondersteuning voor onze fysieke winkels.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

De kwaliteitsregistratie heeft als doel om de kwaliteit van zorg voor deze patiëntengroepen in alle Nederlandse ziekenhuizen inzichtelijk te maken en te verbeteren. Daarnaast heeft DGOA tot doel om wetenschappelijk onderzoek uit te voeren met *real world data*. Dit draagt bij aan transparantie in zorgkwaliteit voor diverse landelijke stakeholders.

De kwaliteitsregistratie DICA Gynaecologische oncologie is onderdeel van DICA. Bij DICA verzamelen wij met onze 26 kwaliteitsregistraties data over patiënten, behandelingen en complicaties.

-------------------


This project aims to understand how people living in the Netherlands perceive different climate change-related health risks, how they search for and process information about these risks, and what factors determine readiness to act, to ultimately make recommendations about how to communicate effectively about the health impacts of climate change.


To do this, four studies are performed utilizing survey designs, social media analysis, and mixed methods (survey and focus groups/interviews). As a start, the risk perceptions of the general public in relation to several possible health risks related to climate change are examined. Special attention is paid to vulnerable groups, such as elderly, children, individuals with chronic diseases and migrants. Based on the results of this first study and literature review, a particular subgroup and risk will be chosen to focus on (for example mental health of young people, or heat stress among the elderly) in the subsequent studies.


**Job requirements**
--------------------


The applicant for this position is expected to have a (research) master’s degree in the social sciences (e.g., sociology, social or health psychology, communication studies) or health sciences (public health, global health). A good statistical background and experience with quantitative research is essential; an interest or experience with qualitative methods is an advantage. Computer skills should include SPSS, SAS, R or similar statistical software. Applicants must have excellent speaking and writing skills in English and preferably Dutch, should hold a strong motivation for the research topic ‘planetary health’ and are fairly interested in risk communication.


**Employment conditions and benefits**
--------------------------------------


We offer you an internationally oriented and varied job in an enthusiastic team, with excellent working conditions in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU).


The start date of this position is 1 Sep 2024 (or in mutual agreement) and you will be based at campus Woudestein Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM). This position is for 1 fte. The salary ranges from a minimum of € 2.770 to a maximum of € 3.539 gross per month Scale PhD on a fulltime basis (38 hours), in accordance with the CAO-NU. The contract is entered into for the duration of 1.5 year, which will be extended with a second term of 2.5 years if the candidate performs well.


Everything else we offer you, you can find below!


* Everything you need for a **good work-life balance**: the option to work from home in consultation with your manager, 41 days of paid leave with a 40 hour contract, 8% holiday pay and an 8.3% end-of-year bonus, and a significant discount on a subscription for our on-campus sports centre!


* **Sustainable, inclusive and diverse work environment** with an open culture, where you can be yourself and we pay attention to each other and to the world around us. Make the most of our bicycle budget, or join networks such as Young@EUR, FAME or QuEUR.


* Time and space for your development in the broadest sense: development days and a personal career budget and free access to our university library.


* Good pension with ABP that EUR contributes 2/3rds towards, discounts on various collective insurances with Zilveren Kruis Achmea, Loyalis, and Allianz, and compensation for travel, working from home and home internet use.

=======================================================================


To study the impact, societal costs and benefits and equity consequences of different prevention strategies, using simulation models and large data sets.


Closing date 11-07-2024
26.04.24.TG
  
### **Job description**


Should health prevention be targeted at individuals with the highest risk of disease or towards the entire population? What are the societal costs and benefits of these two approaches? And how do they impact health inequalities?  

  

If you get excited about these questions, we are looking for you: an ambitious postdoctoral researcher to join our multidisciplinary research team.  

  

In this project, you will analyze the population- and distributional impact of targeted and population-based interventions on health, societal costs and benefits and equity impact. You will develop and use simulation models to investigate the impact of the key ingredients on the distributional impact of public health interventions: the distribution of the risk factor, the initial distribution of the health outcome, the exposure-outcome relationship and the (potentially heterogeneous) effectiveness of the intervention. You will combine these models with detailed administrative and survey data to apply the theoretical insights to one ore more case studies. One potential application is the introduction of sugar taxes in the Netherlands and their effect on overweight and obesity and weight-related health outcomes.  

  

You will be supervised by prof. dr. Frank van Lenthe and dr. Joost Oude Groeniger based at the department of Public Health of Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam and dr. Bram Wouterse at the Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management. You will also collaborate with experts on public health and economic evaluations at these schools and within the Smarter Choices for Better Health initiative.


  
### **Work environment**


You will be based at the department of Public Health at Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam.  

  

This project is part of the Erasmus Initiative 'Smarter Choices for Better Health' in which Erasmus University and Erasmus MC Rotterdam jointly work on research on prevention and health equity. As such, you will be part of an inspiring and interdisciplinary community of researchers.


  
### **Qualifications and skills**


We are looking for a researcher with strong quantitative skills. Preferably, you have experience with both building and running (micro-)simulation models and the analysis of large data sets. Experience with R (or comparable software) is highly recommended. A background in epidemiology or health economics is beneficial, but anyone with the necessary quantitative skills and an interest in public health and health inequality is invited to apply. A PhD degree is required for this position.

  

 

Before you apply please check our conditions for employment.


  
### **Terms of employment**

  

* You will receive a temporary position for 2 years.
* The gross monthly salary amounts a maximum of € 5.504,- (scale 10).
* Excellent fringe benefits, such as a 13th month that is already paid out in November and a individual travel expense package.
* An International Office which aids you in preparing for you arrival and stay.
* Pension insurance with ABP. We take care of approximately 2/3 of the monthly contribution.

-------------------


Are you looking to shape the future of human-AI collaboration in making important decisions? Join us in this fully funded PhD project! In the next four years, you will conduct scientific research to inform the design of new intelligent systems that excel at not only making decisions but also understand their human users in collaborative decision-making.


Are you looking to shape the future of human-AI collaboration in making important decisions? Join us in this fully funded PhD project! In the next four years, you will conduct scientific research to inform the design of new intelligent systems that excel at not only making decisions but also understand their human users in collaborative decision-making.


The recent developments in AI-assisted decision-making call for an emerging field of human-AI decision-making, i.e., the study of how to improve collaborative decision-making between AI algorithms and human users. Current research in human-AI decision making focuses on technical contributions, such as new algorithms and visualizations that help people understand AI’s decisions by providing explanations (i.e., explainable AI), but overlooks the opposite side of the problem, i.e., how to make AI understand the human decision-maker in the task environment. This is critical in improving the effectiveness and usability of the AI assistance.


In this project, we will explore the possibilities of tracking and inferring users’ mental states through real-time sensory data (e.g., physiological, eye-tracking, movement) and cognitive modeling (i.e., computational modeling of human cognition and decision-making). More specifically, we expect you to (1) study the literature and identify a few decision-making tasks and contexts where our approach has the most potential; (2) build data-driven and/or theory-based user models in the identified contexts of human-AI decision-making; and (3) conduct empirical studies to access the added values of the approach.


As a PhD candidate, you will work in the Human-Technology Interaction group at the Department of Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences. Since the research topic is at the intersection of psychology, human-computer interaction, and AI, you will be supervised by a team of researchers with complementary expertise: Prof. Dr. Chris Snijders (trust in AI, decision-making), Dr. Chao Zhang (human-AI interaction, cognitive modeling), and Dr. Linghan Zhang (signal processing, affective and behavioral computing). Furthermore, you will have access to TU/e’s PhD level courses and training, and are encouraged to collaborate with other researchers at the department and the Eindhoven Artificial Intelligence Systems Institute (EAISI). You are expected to publish your research findings in peer-reviewed journals and at international conferences. The PhD project will conclude a high-quality PhD dissertation on the proposed topic after four years.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* Recently completed (or be close to the completion of) a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction, Cognitive Science, Data Science or a related discipline with demonstrable interest and experience in Psychology [OR] a Master's degree in Psychology or a related field, with demonstrable interest and experience in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
* Demonstrable experience in conducting empirical research with human participants.
* Demonstrable experience with processing complex datasets (e.g., physiological, eye-tracking, sensor data) and applying (state-of-the-art) statistical techniques.
* Strong interest in how people make decisions and how AI can be used to improve decision-making.
* Strong technical skills in programming (e.g., Python, R) and mathematics are a plus.
* Excellent analytical and problem-solving abilities.
* Effective communication skills and the ability to work collaboratively in a diverse, interdisciplinary team.
* Professional proficiency in written and spoken English.

**Conditions of employment**
----------------------------


A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:


* Full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.
* Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the *Collective Labour Agreement* for Dutch Universities, scale P (min. €2,770 max. €3,539).
* A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
* High-quality training programs and other support to grow into a self-aware, autonomous scientific researcher. At TU/e we challenge you to take charge of your own learning process.
* An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
* An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
* A Staff Immigration Team and a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) for international candidates.

Wil jij meedenken en bouwen aan nieuwe IT-faciliteiten en software die onze statistische processen gereed maken voor de toekomst? Ben jij de teamspeler die applicaties bouwt waar gebruikers blij van worden?  

Maak het verschil en solliciteer.


  
jouw uitdaging


Onze onderzoekers kunnen hulp gebruiken bij het automatiseren van hun statistische processen. De huidige applicaties zijn aan herontwikkeling en/of uitbreiding toe.  

Voor de herontwikkeling maken wij de overstap naar Python en R en naar meer generieke systemen. Ook willen we het gebruik van databases stimuleren. Je werkt in een multidisciplinair team waarbij je kennis deelt en opdoet.
  

Als developer ben je een allrounder en houd je van diversiteit en afwisseling in je werk. Omdat het team klein is ben je bij alle facetten van de applicatieontwikkeling betrokken. Van het nadenken over een geschikte architectuur en het maken van geautomtiseerde testen tot het overleg met gebruikers over de gewenste functionaliteit en het visualiseren van gegevens, zodat inhoudelijk experts controles snel en eenvoudig uit kunnen voeren.  

Je werk bestaat uit:


* Het (her)ontwerpen, bouwen en testen van packages en (maatwerk)systemen in Python en R, en het vertalen van klantwensen en ideeën van (eind)gebruikers in softwareontwerpen en herbruikbare applicaties.
* Inzetten van je professionele kennis en ervaring aan collega’s binnen het CBS, optreden als een vraagbaak en coach op het gebied van Python, R en SQL, en meedenken over de IT-faciliteiten voor Data Scientists en Statistisch Onderzoekers.
* Optreden als sparringpartner voor de business, waarbij je met de juiste vragen toegevoegde waarde levert om tot een nog beter product te komen.
* Actief bijdragen aan een professionele werkomgeving door je kennis en ervaring te delen en te ondersteunen bij de ontwikkeling van IT-oplossingen.
Dit is je team

Medewerkers


Het team bestaat momenteel uit 3 medewerkers.
Samenwerking


Je zet je expertise breed in binnen de sector Leefomgeving en werkt samen met ontwikkelaars uit de verschillende teams.
Je komt te werken in een klein team, dat zoveel mogelijk de agile werkwijze volgt en de verschillende inhoudelijke teams helpt op het gebied van applicatieontwikkeling. Je werkt in projecten van ongeveer 9 maanden steeds weer aan een andere applicatie. We beheren de applicaties niet zelf.  

Je komt te werken bij de sector Leefomgeving, waar productie plaatsvindt van statistieken op het gebied van de woningmarkt, energie, natuur, milieu en ruimtelijke statistieken. De CBS-statistieken staan in grote belangstelling bij onder meer de Europese Commissie, onderzoeksorganisates, planbureaus, de ministeries en nationale- en internationale media.  

Maatschappelijke en technologische ontwikkelingen dagen ons uit om te blijven vernieuwen en ontwikkelen. Om toonaangevend te blijven is het CBS bezig statistische processen opnieuw in te richten.
Dit ben jij


* Hbo denk- en werkniveau.
* Je hebt ervaring met het verwerken van data in Python of R.
* Je hebt ervaring met database architectuur.
* Ervaring met GIT, ArcGIS of andere GIS-software zijn een pré.

* Een salaris van minimaal EUR 3404,- en maximaal EUR 6110,- bruto per maand op basis van 36 uur. Afhankelijk van je kennis en ervaring.
* 8% vakantiegeld en een 13e maand. In totaal is dit 16,5% bovenop je salaris. Dit noemen wij het Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB). Je bepaalt zelf hoe, wanneer en op welke manier je dit budget wilt inzetten.
* Pensioenopbouw bij het ABP Pensioenfonds.
* Een laptop (Microsoft of Apple) en mobiele telefoon (Android of iOS).
* Twee tot drie dagen thuiswerken, de rest ben je aanwezig in ons onlangs gerenoveerde gebouw. In je team maak je daar verder afspraken over.

-------------------


  
**Ideale startersfunctie voor toegepast onderzoek**  

Het deelnemen aan online kansspelen is met ingang van 1 oktober 2021 gelegaliseerd door de wet kansspelen op afstand (KOA). Wij houden toezicht op een nieuwe, internationale markt, die onder andere op het gebied van informatietechnologie sterk verschilt van de markt voor landgebonden kansspelen. Dat doen we risico gestuurd en steeds meer datagedreven: we werken als eerste aan de grootste problemen met de meeste risico’s voor de consument. Cruciaal hiervoor is de informatiepositie van de Kansspelautoriteit.


**Vragen waar jij warm voor loopt zijn:**


*“Hoe zorgen we voor een markt waarin de speler wordt beschermd, kansspelverslaving wordt voorkomen en illegaliteit en criminaliteit wordt bestreden?”*


*“Wat doet de markt zelf al, wat zijn de effecten daarvan en welke interventies zou de Kansspelautoriteit kunnen doen ter bevordering van veilig spelen?”.*



Je signaleert trends en ontwikkelingen met behulp van (markt)analyses. Voor het maken van je analyses maak je gebruik van uiteenlopende soorten data. Je bent in staat om – onder begeleiding - een onderzoeksvraag te formuleren, de nodige bronnen aan elkaar te koppelen, de analyses uit te voeren en de resultaten te presenteren aan je collega’s.


**Wat ga je concreet doen:**


* Je draait mee in (markt)analyses en systematische onderzoeken.
* Je signaleert risico's, problemen en trends, laat relevante ontwikkelingen zien in kwantitatieve analyses.
* Je doet analyse van speelgedrag of gedrag van aanbieders, zowel legaal als illegaal. Denk hierbij aan inzicht vergaren in het naleven van de zorgplicht door kansspelaanbieders, naleving van de reclameregels en de anti witwasregels.
* Je houdt je goed op de hoogte van maatschappelijke en economische ontwikkelingen op jouw vakgebied.
* Je signaleert blinde vlekken in de informatiepositie van de Kansspelautoriteit en doet voorstellen hoe deze te verbeteren.
* Je werkt samen met collega’s met verschillende disciplines en projecten.


**Nieuwsgierig geworden?** Wij nodigen je van harte uit je te laten inspireren en enthousiasmeren:  

Lees hier het verhaal van Martin.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
* Je hebt een afgeronde relevante WO opleiding in economie, econometrie, wiskunde of eventueel sociale wetenschappen met een nadruk op kwantitatieve onderzoeksmethoden.
* Je bent net afgestudeerd en hebt affiniteit met het verrichten van (markt)analyses.
* Je hebt ervaring met R of Python of vergelijkbaar.
* Je hebt interesse in vraagstukken op het gebied van kansspelen en veilig spelen.
* Je bent analytisch, kritisch en resultaatgericht en doortastend.
* Jouw analyses, adviezen en rapportages zijn vlot leesbaar en geschreven in goed Nederlands.
* Mondeling gebruik je duidelijke taal, to the point, afgestemd op de doelgroep.

--------------------------


  
Bij de Kansspelautoriteit werken betrokken en bevlogen mensen. Onze lijnen zijn kort, de bureaucratie is minimaal.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



Je maakt deel uit van de afdeling Analyse en Onderzoek, een jong en gedreven team. Van hieruit werk je met je 14 collega’s nauw samen ter ondersteuning van de collega’s van andere afdelingen zoals de afdeling toezicht en de afdeling handhaving. Je bent breed in de organisatie inzetbaar.



**Kansspelautoriteit**
----------------------



De Kansspelautoriteit is onafhankelijk toezichthouder voor de naleving van een veilig kansspelaanbod. Als zelfstandig bestuursorgaan (ZBO) heeft de Kansspelautoriteit een unieke positie tussen overheden, aanbieders, consumenten en de maatschappij. De kansspelmarkt is volop in beweging. De Kansspelautoriteit hecht daarbij extra aan de belangen van consumenten. Zij moeten veilig kunnen spelen.  

De Kansspelautoriteit informeert en beschermt consumenten tegen onder andere misleidende reclame en helpt kansspelverslaving voorkomen. De Kansspelautoriteit gaat illegale kansspelen tegen, evenals het gebruiken of misbruiken van kansspelen voor criminele activiteiten, waaronder witwassen en aan kansspelen gerelateerde wedstrijdvervalsing. Bovendien behoort het reguleren van een passend legaal aanbod tot een van de kerntaken. Onderdeel van deze taak is het beoordelen en toekennen, dan wel afwijzen van vergunningsaanvragen, het toezien op naleving van wet- en regelgeving door vergunninghouders en het handhavend optreden bij het niet naleven daarvan. De Kansspelautoriteit is ook internationaal actief, samenwerkend met andere toezichthouders op kansspelen, vooral in Europa.

### **Functie inhoud**


Als analist/adviseur Integraal Capaciteitsmanagement ondersteun je het management in verschillende lagen van het ziekenhuis bij de besluitvorming omtrent capaciteitsvraagstukken. Je onderbouwt adviezen met analyses en rapportages over de gehele planningscyclus van patiënten en capaciteiten, zowel op strategisch, tactisch als operationeel niveau. Hiervoor analiseer je data vanuit diverse bronnen om tot adviezen te komen. Zo maken we gebruik van Power BI, SQL en Excel om informatie uit HiX (ziekenhuisinformatiesysteem) en OWS (roostersoftware) te ontsluiten. Mogelijk gaan we in de toekomst ook gebruik maken van specifieke software voor capaciteitsmanagement.  

  

Je bereidt samen met je collega's reguliere capaciteitsmanagementoverleggen voor (zoals scenario-analyses en trendmonitoring), je monitort de wachtlijsten en de capaciteitsbezetting en analyseert eventuele verwachte knelpunten. Je verzorgt hiervoor rapportages en overzichten, creëert scenario's en communiceert deze in begrijpelijke taal naar de gebruikers.  

  

Jouw analyses en adviezen ondersteunen de onderlinge afstemming tussen afdelingen ten behoeve van optimalisatie in de benutting van capaciteiten binnen en tussen afdelingen. Daarnaast adviseer je bij specifieke vraagstukken waarbij capaciteitsmanagement een rol speelt. Hierbij kun je denken aan vraagstukken rondom de indeling van OK-sessies, beschikbare bedden en business cases. Je weet de verschillende partijen te verbinden en de veranderingsbereidheid te activeren.


  
### **Werkomgeving**


In het Erasmus MC werken we hard aan het verbeteren van de zorg van vandaag en de gezondheid van morgen. Baanbrekend werken, grenzen verleggen en vooroplopen. In onderzoek, onderwijs en zorg. We werken met de nieuwste apparatuur, technieken en zorgprocessen in een state-of-the-art gebouw.

Als analist/adviseur van de afdeling Integraal Capaciteitsmanagement werk je zowel binnen het Sophia Kinderziekenhuis, als binnen de Centrum Locatie. Bij ICM zijn ook collega-analisten, een datascientist, een HiX adviseur en organisatieadviseurs werkzaam. Je werkt daarnaast nauw samen met collega's van het Sophia, medisch specialisten, managers, HR en Informatiemanagement. Daarnaast werk je met medewerkers die betrokken zijn bij de planning op afdelingen, zoals binnen de klinieken, bureau opname en het operatiecentrum.


  
### **Profiel**


In de functie van analist/adviseur bij de afdeling Integraal Capaciteitsmanagement worden hoge eisen gesteld aan jouw accuratesse, organisatiesensitiviteit en sociale vaardigheden. Je bent in staat zelfstandig te werken, hoofd- en bijzaken te onderscheiden en verbeterpotentie te signaleren in planning en logistieke analyses. Je beschikt over goede communicatieve vaardigheden. Je beschikt over overtuigingskracht, bent proactiviteit en tactvol.


* Voor een goede uitoefening van de functie is een afgeronde wo-opleiding Bedrijfskundige Informatica, (Technische) Bedrijfskunde of een vergelijkbare studie vereist.

We are seeking a highly motivated and talented technician to join a project within CropXR’s core research programme. You will perform experiments on two commercially important species: lettuce and potato. The project will focus on optimising stress protocols (heat, drought) and generating phenotypic and physiological data for these two species. This will form crucial experimental input for downstream mathematical modelling of stress responses in these species. You will have the opportunity to interact with PhD candidates, postdocs and scientists involved in different aspects of this work programme but also the extended CropXR team. The position will be based in a dynamic and collaborative research environment working under the supervision of Professor Rashmi Sasidharan and Professor Guido van den Ackerveken.

Als Content Analist speel je een essentiële rol bij het verbeteren van de verkoop van abonnementen voor alle DPG Mediamerken.


De kwaliteit van redactionele content neemt tegenwoordig een belangrijke rol in bij de keuze van een lezer om over te gaan tot het nemen van een abonnement. Het is daarom belangrijk dat we begrijpen waarom het ene artikel wel tot nieuwe abonnees leidt en het andere niet.



Het werken voor alle DPG Mediamerken betekent dat er een schat aan data ligt op basis waarvan we mediamerken kunnen benchmarken. Welk merk voert een redactionele contentstrategie die enorm effectief blijkt als we kijken naar de abonnementenbase? En welk merk voert een effectieve paywallstrategie? Zo maar wat vragen waar wij ons als team dagelijks mee bezig houden.



Om ervoor te zorgen dat de juiste content, bij de juiste doelgroep terechtkomt werkt het team nauw samen met de subteams in het Digitale Ecosysteem (zoals online marketing, e-mail en paygate). Met als resultaat dat lezers vaker terugkomen en zorgen voor een consistente instroom aan nieuwe abonnementen. Daarnaast zorgt dit bovendien voor een sterke toename van het ingelogde bereik en engagement, twee andere belangrijke doelstellingen van DPG Media.



Omdat het aantal DPG Mediamerken fors is uitgebreid en we ook intensief zijn gaan inzetten op nieuwe manieren om content te consumeren zoals luisteren, kijken en spelen is het tijd om ook het team verder uit te breiden met een Senior Content Analist.  

  



**Jouw verantwoordelijkheden:**



Je doet deepdives op allerlei dwarsdoorsneden die content gerelateerd zijn. Denk aan artikel-, auteur-, onderwerpniveau en de behoefte waarin de content voorziet. De inzichten die je opdoet deel je proactief met jouw marketingcollega’s.



Daarnaast ben je druk met het analyseren van de conversiefunnel. Je weet waar in de funnel het niet goed loopt. En nog belangrijker: Je bent uit nieuwsgierigheid gedreven om uit te zoeken *waarom* het niet goed loopt. Daarbij redeneer je vanuit de rol van content, maar ook vanuit het gedrag van de lezer.



Je bent in staat verschillende Mediamerken met elkaar te vergelijken om erachter te komen welke content- en of paywallstrategie werkt bij het ene merk en bij het andere merk niet. Op basis daarvan adviseer je het management.


**Wie we zoeken:**

  

* Je hebt een scherp analytisch vermogen en kunt nauwkeurig werken.
* Goede communicatieve vaardigheden zijn essentieel voor effectieve samenwerking en kennisoverdracht.
* Je bent proactief, resultaatgericht en hebt een passie voor het verbeteren van digitale abonnementenverkoop.
* Ervaring en bekendheid met data-analysetools, inclusief het vermogen om data op functioneel niveau te vertalen naar begrijpelijke taal.
* Minimaal 5 jaar relevante ervaring.
* WO werk- en denkniveau.
* Ben je werkzaam geweest op een redactie dan is dit een grote pré.
* Perfecte beheersing van de Nederlandse taal spreekt voor zich.


* Als je in staat bent de data/inzichten op een creatieve en begrijpelijke manier te visualiseren is dat absoluut een pré.


**Wat wij bieden:**

  

* Een dynamische werkomgeving binnen een van de meest innovatieve mediabedrijven.
* Kansen voor persoonlijke en professionele groei.
* Een enthousiast team van professionals om mee samen te werken.
* Competitieve arbeidsvoorwaarden en secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden.

De AFM transformeert zich momenteel naar een Datagedreven toezichthouder. Dat geeft jou de kans om datagedreven toezicht binnen onze organisatie en binnen de afdeling Datagedreven Kapitaalmarkten nog steviger op de kaart te zetten. Nu, maar ook in de toekomst, rekenen onze toezichthouders steeds vaker op jouw kwaliteiten. Met jouw analytische skills verwerk je data tot informatieproducten (dashboards, modellen, rapportages) en herontwerp je toezichtprocessen om hiervan gebruik te maken. Hierdoor wordt onze besluitvorming efficiënter, effectiever en robuuster.  

  

Het toezicht op de kapitaalmarkten wordt binnen de AFM uitgevoerd door twee afdelingen: de afdelingen Datagedreven Kapitaalmarkten (DAK) en Kapitaalmarktinfrastructuur &Transparantietoezicht (KIT). De samenstelling van de afdelingen is divers in leeftijd, geslacht en studie- en werkachtergrond. Je standplaats zal binnen de afdeling DAK zijn.

Ook signaleren, analyseren en onderzoeken wij vermeend marktmisbruik (bijvoorbeeld handel met voorwetenschap, marktmanipulatie en juiste openbaarmaking van voorwetenschap).

Je werkt vanuit dit multidisciplinaire team (samen met *andere analisten*, *toezichthouders*, *datamanagementspecialisten* en *data-engineers*) aan uitdagende toezichtsvraagstukken voor de twee afdelingen die toezicht houden op de kapitaalmarkten. Hierbij lever je een bijdrage aan verschillende soorten toepassingen op allerlei onderwerpen. Je werkt bijvoorbeeld mee aan analyses van algoritmische handel op grondstoffenmarkten, text mining-modellen voor het toetsen van prospectussen en de jaarlijkse AFM-publicatie State of the Capital Markets. Het onderwerp duurzaamheid heeft de komende jaren de nadrukkelijke aandacht binnen de kapitaalmarkten en daarvoor werk je ook mee aan het maken van data-toepassingen.

* Microsoft Power BI;
* SQL Server Management Studio;

Bij de AFM ontwikkel je innovatieve datagedreven toepassingen en creëer je inzichten waarmee je risico’s binnen de financiële markten identificeert en onderbouwt.**  

  

De AFM transformeert zich momenteel naar een Datagedreven toezichthouder. Dat geeft jou de kans om datagedreven toezicht binnen onze organisatie en binnen de afdeling Datagedreven Kapitaalmarkten nog steviger op de kaart te zetten. Nu, maar ook in de toekomst, rekenen onze toezichthouders steeds vaker op jouw kwaliteiten. Met jouw analytische skills verwerk je data tot informatieproducten (dashboards, modellen, rapportages) en herontwerp je toezichtprocessen om hiervan gebruik te maken. Hierdoor wordt onze besluitvorming efficiënter, effectiever en robuuster.  

  

Het toezicht op de kapitaalmarkten wordt binnen de AFM uitgevoerd door twee afdelingen: de afdelingen Datagedreven Kapitaalmarkten (DAK) en Kapitaalmarktinfrastructuur &Transparantietoezicht (KIT). De samenstelling van de afdelingen is divers in leeftijd, geslacht en studie- en werkachtergrond. Je standplaats zal binnen de afdeling DAK zijn. Met haar teams houdt DAK toezicht op – niet uitputtend - meldingen, de deponering van financiële verslaggeving, short selling en de rapportage van transacties in financiële instrumenten op en buiten de handelsplatformen. Ook signaleren, analyseren en onderzoeken wij vermeend marktmisbruik (bijvoorbeeld handel met voorwetenschap, marktmanipulatie en juiste openbaarmaking van voorwetenschap). Hierdoor ben je goed in staat om de verbinding te maken tussen de analysebehoefte van toezichthouders en de uitvoering daarvan door het business DevOps team Kapitaalmarkten. Je werkt vanuit dit multidisciplinaire team (samen met *andere analisten*, *toezichthouders*, *datamanagementspecialisten* en *data-engineers*) aan uitdagende toezichtsvraagstukken voor de twee afdelingen die toezicht houden op de kapitaalmarkten. Hierbij lever je een bijdrage aan verschillende soorten toepassingen op allerlei onderwerpen. Je werkt bijvoorbeeld mee aan analyses van algoritmische handel op grondstoffenmarkten, text mining-modellen voor het toetsen van prospectussen en de jaarlijkse AFM-publicatie State of the Capital Markets. Het onderwerp duurzaamheid heeft de komende jaren de nadrukkelijke aandacht binnen de kapitaalmarkten en daarvoor werk je ook mee aan het maken van data-toepassingen.  

  

Hiervoor gebruiken we onder andere de volgende tools, technieken en services:  

* Microsoft Power BI;
* SQL Server Management Studio;
* Machine Learning (in Python);
* Azure Databricks.

Je maakt deel uit van het datateam Diverse Stafafdelingen binnen de afdeling Data, Innovatie & Analyse (DIA).

Als junior data-analist bij Lyceo werk je in een klein team, maar maak je grote impact!


**In 't kort**


* Werken in een leuk team, waar je veel kunt leren van je collega's.
* Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals direct een contract voor onbepaalde tijd.
* Een functie met impact bij de grootste onderwijsondersteuner van Nederland.
* Ongekend goede werksfeer met gezellige lunches, borrels en een informele sfeer.


**Lyceo – Leren leer je zo!**



Ieder kind is anders. En met miljoenen verschillende talenten én struikelblokken, gaat leren niet voor iedereen vanzelf. Daarom hebben sommige leerlingen wat extra aandacht nodig. Aandacht voor leren zelf. Want leren kun je leren. Dat vinden we niet alleen, dat hebben we ook wetenschappelijk bewezen.



Bij Lyceo leren we leerlingen leren. Daar hebben ze bij elke toets, elk school- of studiejaar en bij alles wat ze daarna ondernemen, profijt van. Mede dankzij jou gaan leerlingen straks met meer zelfvertrouwen naar school.

**Wat ga je doen?**



Een greep uit de werkzaamheden:


* Het zelfstandig maken van en onderhouden van waardevolle rapportages en dashboards voor de organisatie. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan een dashboard voor vestigingsmanagers waar zij inzicht krijgen in hun wekelijkse omzet, hun operationele cijfers en hun doelstellingen. Deze maak je primair in Power BI.
* Je ondersteunt collega’s met data gerelateerde vragen. Dit kan van alles zijn, denk bijvoorbeeld aan HR die een selectie opvraagt van alle studenten die het afgelopen jaar hebben gewerkt als huiswerkbegeleider.
* Het maken van analyses en prognoses om kansen en valkuilen te identificeren. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan het maken van een wervingsprognose om aan de hand van de verwachte vraag te voorspellen waar mogelijke tekorten kunnen ontstaan.

**Data-Analist Nick aan het woord:**  

  

*“Het zijn van een data-analist bij Lyceo betekent dat je te maken krijgt met alle afdelingen, mensen en processen van een dynamisch bedrijf, wat de baan ook ontzettend dynamisch en gevarieerde maakt. Stel je voor: de ene dag creëer je een emaillijst om klanten te benaderen voor de marketing afdeling, terwijl je de volgende dag een gloednieuw dashboard publiceert voor 150 vestigingsmanagers, zodat zij de prestaties van hun locaties kunnen volgen. Misschien help je finance om een foutieve omzetboeking te corrigeren, of presenteer je een analyse die de verkoop van examentrainingen volgend jaar zal laten groeien. Tussendoor beantwoord je ad-hoc vragen van collega’s over waar ze bepaalde data kunnen vinden en geef je hen toegang tot deze informatie. Niet alleen de werkzaamheden maken dit zo’n leuke functie ook de sfeer en regelmatige borrels maken het een ontzettend leuke, uitdagende en gezellige werkplek!”*

Wanneer nodig denk en werk je ook mee aan de ontwikkeling van optimalisaties aan opwerkmethodes voor verschillende monster-matrixen (bodem, weefsels, sedimenten). Verschillende imaging technieken waaronder transmissie elektronenmicroscopie (TEM) van nanomaterialen, al dan niet in biologisch of plantaardig weefsel. Daarnaast wordt van je verwacht dat je desgewenst een bijdrage levert aan andere ondersteunende diensten binnen het CML, zoals bijvoorbeeld het bestellen van materialen die nodig zijn voor de analyses die jij begeleid/uitvoert. En moet je het leuk vinden om beginnende promovendi en studenten te ondersteunen en leren over de data vergaring.

**36 uur**  

Ben jij maatschappelijk betrokken en wil je impact maken? Word trainee bij de gemeente Vlaardingen! Je doet 1,5 jaar werkervaring op in een middelgrote gemeente met korte lijnen en je volgt een opleidingsprogramma samen met je mede-trainees. Kortom: Leren, ontdekken en ontwikkelen van het eigen talent!

**Wat en waar?**  

Team Informatiemanagement zorgt ervoor dat onze gemeente altijd up-to-date kán zijn met de laatste informatie. We zijn constant bezig met het verbeteren en aanpassen van onze systemen, zodat ze perfect aansluiten bij wat er speelt in Vlaardingen, zoals nieuwe manieren van werken en slim gebruik van data. Informatiemanagement is eigenlijk zoiets als de DJ op een groot feest, waarbij de teams de dansvloer vormen. We zorgen ervoor dat de muziek perfect is afgestemd op de stemming op de dansvloer, dat iedereen in de juiste groove komt en dat feest de hele nacht doorgaat. We mixen de beats, voelen de sfeer aan en zorgen ervoor dat iedereen op die dansvloer blijft en geniet van het feest. Oftewel: informatiemanagement zorgt ervoor dat alle informatie en processen binnen de gemeente soepel en efficiënt verlopen, zoals een goed georganiseerd feest waar iedereen van geniet en meedoet. Een organisatie die in beweging blijft en in de juiste flow zit. Een organisatie om trots op te zijn.

**Jouw opdrachten**  

Als trainee Informatiemanagement ontwikkel jij je van informatie-analist tot informatie-adviseur. De eerste 6 maanden draai je mee in het scherp in beeld brengen van alle gegevens die binnen Vlaardingen worden gebruikt en beheerd. Je spoort beheer en gebruik van informatie in processen en applicaties op, legt de informatie catalogus aan en hanteert deze als structuur bij het opbouwen en inrichten van de Vlaardingse Informatie Basis. Dat doe je uiteraard niet alleen maar samen met je collega's. De opdrachten daarna stem je af met je begeleiders. Je kunt bijvoorbeeld meer richting het werkveld van de business intelligence, gegevensmakelaar of meer aan de business-kant de organisatie helpen met het beter gebruiken van informatie. Uiteraard zorgen we voor goede begeleiding door ervaren collega's.


Ook ga je samen met de andere trainees aan de slag met een eigen project. Dit maatschappelijke project gaan jullie samen plannen, bedenken en uitvoeren. Tijdens het hele traject word je intensief gecoacht en volg je om de week op vrijdag verschillende trainingen. Je leert tijdens het traineeship onder andere hoe een gemeente werkt, je gaat aan de slag met persoonlijk leiderschap en je ontwikkelt jouw communicatiestijl.

**Onze ambitie, jouw missie**  

Door middel van dit traineeship ervaar je hoe het is om voor een gemeente te werken. Je maakt kennis met de diversiteit aan onderwerpen en projecten. Je krijgt de kans om, ook als starter op de arbeidsmarkt, het verschil te maken voor de bewoners en ondernemers in Vlaardingen. Tegelijkertijd breng jij met jouw persoonlijkheid, achtergrond en talent nieuwe perspectieven binnen, waar wij als organisatie van kunnen leren.


Dit krijg je van ons:

* Salaris: 3.317,- bruto per maand.
* Een contract van 18 maanden voor 36 uur per week (32 uur opdracht, 4 uur voor trainingen en ontwikkeling)
* Deelname aan ons Vlaardings traineeprogramma
* Persoonlijke coaching en begeleiding

**Wanneer hebben we een match?**

* Je hebt HBO of WO werk- en denkniveau en je bent een starter op de arbeidsmarkt.
* Je hebt een opleidingsachtergrond (of zeer sterke interesse) in het onderwerp.
* Je wilt impact maken in onze stad
* Je bent ambitieus, gedreven, nieuwsgierig en ondernemend
* Je wilt jezelf ontwikkelen en werken aan je persoonlijke groei


Wij zijn vooral benieuwd naar jou als persoon. Welke impact wil jij in Vlaardingen maken? Wat is jouw talent? Wat wil je graag leren?

**Interesse?**  

Leuk! Via de sollicitatiebutton kan je jouw cv en motivatie insturen (vooral het 'waarom' vinden we heel interessant) Of, nog leuker, stuur ons via Whatsapp een korte video-opname waarin je vertelt waarom je graag het traineeship bij de gemeente Vlaardingen wilt volgen. We laten je zo snel mogelijk weten of je wordt uitgenodigd, je kunt al op korte termijn starten. Heb je vooraf nog vragen, bel of app met Edo Ridder (coördinator traineeprogramma) via 06 15442704. Je opname kan naar hetzelfde telefoonnummer en vergeet je cv niet.

**Procedure**  

Jouw eerste gesprek is met Edo Ridder en Suzan van Os (talent recruiter). Daarin onderzoeken we of we een match zijn. Tijdens een tweede gesprek maak je kennis met de teammanager van je toekomstige team en gaan we wat meer de diepte in over de opdracht. Zijn we nog steeds allemaal enthousiast? Dan sluiten we af met een arbeidsvoorwaardengesprek waarbij je je contract ondertekent.  

Als je wilt, kun je al snel starten met je traineeship. Uiteraard zijn we flexibel en houden we rekening met jouw opzegtermijn. Ons doel is om in ieder geval per 1 september met de volledige groep nieuwe trainees te kunnen starten met het opleidingsgedeelte.

Wil je deel uitmaken van een dynamisch team waar jouw analytische vaardigheden en innovatieve ideeën het verschil maken? Dan zijn wij op zoek naar jou!*

 **Wie zijn wij?**


**Bevolkingsonderzoek Nederland** in haar huidige vorm bestaat sinds januari 2022. De nieuwe (landelijke) organisatie is ontstaan uit een fusie van vijf regionale organisaties. Bevolkingsonderzoek Nederland is verantwoordelijk voor de uitvoering van drie bevolkingsonderzoeken in Nederland: wij screenen verschillende bevolkingsgroepen op **baarmoederhalskanker**, **darmkanker** en **borstkanker**. Ruim **4,5 miljoen Nederlanders** worden jaarlijks uitgenodigd voor één of meerdere van deze bevolkingsonderzoeken. Bij onze organisatie werken 950 collega's aan hetzelfde doel: een bijdrage leveren aan de vroegtijdige opsporing van kanker. Vroege opsporing helpt! Het vergroot de kans op een succesvolle behandeling en vaak is ook een minder ingrijpende behandeling nodig. Wij zijn trots op ons werk en op onze maatschappelijke bijdrage.

  

Onze **afdeling informatiemanagement** (IM) bestaat uit 12 collega's die met elkaar verantwoordelijk zijn voor de informatievoorziening van Bevolkingsonderzoek Nederland. Voor deze afdeling zoeken wij per direct een Informatieanalist / coördinator data en wetenschap.

Je speelt een cruciale rol in het waarborgen en verbeteren van de informatiestromen binnen één of meerdere screeningsprogramma's. Met korte lijnen fungeer je als de brug tussen de business en IT, waarbij je ervoor zorgt dat de juiste informatie op het juiste moment beschikbaar is. Daarbij implementeer je ook kwaliteitsborgingsmaatregelen om ervoor te zorgen dat gegevens nauwkeurig zijn. Als Informatieanalist werk je nauw samen met medische professionals, business analisten, programmamanagers, IT-specialisten en beleidsmakers (zowel intern als extern) om de integratie van gegevens en processen te optimaliseren.

  



De rol van **Coördinator Data en Wetenschap** is een functie die je als Informatieanalist vervult vanuit het team IM. Je coördineert alle aanvragen op het vlak van wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Daarbij stem je met de wetenschappers af welke informatiebehoeften zij hebben en op welke manier BVO NL daarin kan voorzien. Intern bij BVO NL stem je af met het BI-team over de oplevering van de gewenste informatie. Voor grotere prospectieve studies voer je een impactanalyse uit samen met de business en ondersteun je bij de uitvoering van de studies. Met de Privacy & Security Officer stem je af in hoeverre de data aangeleverd kan worden zonder afbreuk te doen aan de wettelijke kaders waaraan BVO NL zich moet conformeren.

  

Wij zoeken een betrouwbare collega die **transparant** **communiceert** over de voortgang en eventuele knelpunten. Ook ben je in staat om snel en accuraat te handelen in een veranderende omgeving.

---------------------------

  

Werken als Business analist bij de Hub Risk & Compliance? Krijg jij veel plezier van het onderzoeken van uitdagende riskmanagement, proces- en tooling vraagstukken? De Volkbank in Utrecht is op zoek naar een business analist!  

  

Door de toenemende behoefte aan risicomodellen voor de ondersteuning van de risk management werkzaamheden hebben we behoefte aan enthousiaste collega’s die mee willen helpen om onze risicomodellen verder te verbeteren.  

  

Als Business Analist vertaal jij de wensen van de business in heldere oplossingen die IT kan bouwen. Je verzamelt, analyseert en documenteert de business requirements voor processen. Deze requirements vertaal je naar werkbare oplossingen voor een Klant Reis Team om de wijzigingen te bouwen. Je bent onderdeel van het scrumteam en je werkt samen onder leiding van de Product Owner. Het doel van het team is om de implementatie van de risicomodellen van de bank verder te ontwikkelen.  

  

Je houdt je voornamelijk bezig met het inventarisaren en vertalen van stakeholder-wensen om verandering te laten slagen. Dat houdt in dat je de wensen voor nieuwe of verbeterde functionaliteit goed inventariseert en de gevolgen goed overziet. Je doorgrondt de functionele en technische werking van de verschillende tools en bent in staat om oplossingsrichtingen te bedenken die passen binnen de architectuurvisie van de organisatie.  

Je snapt hoe systemen passen in processen en hoe processen helpen om duidelijke en accurate rapportage op de stellen.


Verder weet je goed je weg te vinden naar verschillende stakeholders op verschillende niveaus en kan hen goed meenemen in een verandering. Negatief sentiment weet je goed te identificeren en hier kan je ook goed mee omgaan door dit om te zetten naar positief sentiment.  

Je faciliteert de gehele implementatie en houdt goed overzicht over stappen die genomen moeten worden. Na de implementatie zorg je dat de nieuwe werkwijze goed geborgd is en dat het sentiment ook na de implementatie positief blijft. Het gaat immers om oplossingen die écht werken voor de risk managers en andere stakeholders.  

  

Jouw kwaliteiten  

Je bent analytisch sterk, communicatief vaardig en geduldig. Daarnaast heb je een positieve instelling en een klantgerichte houding. Je bent doortastend en zorgt dat je de ander écht begrijpt. Je hebt zichtbaar plezier in het begrijpelijk maken van processen en vraagstukken. Met een gezonde dosis eigenwijsheid, humor en organisatiesensitiviteit weet je te verbinden en je durft ook kritisch te zijn. Je werkt graag samen in teams, bent stressbestendig en kunt goed plannen. Je neemt eigenaarschap om op het afgesproken moment een topresultaat neerzetten met het team.  

  

Verder heb je:

* Hbo werk- en denkniveau.
* 3 tot 6 jaar relevante werkervaring.
* Ervaring met verandermanagement.
* Ervaring met een implementatiecyclus van software.
* Kennis van processen bij complexe omgevingen en snapt hoe systemen processen ondersteunen.


Over het Team Data Backbone  

Leuk dat je interesse hebt in een vacature bij ons Data Backbone team. Als je het interessant vindt om een breed aandachtsgebied te krijgen waardoor veel diversiteit in werk, met een breed stakeholdermanagementveld (we zijn een relatief kleine bank) binnen een mensgerichte organisatie, dan zit je bij ons goed.


Binnen onze afdeling Data Backbone werken ruim 20 collega’s verdeeld over 3 Klant Reis teams en 2 Product Owners. Deze teams zijn verantwoordelijk voor het realiseren van IT en data oplossingen voor risk managers, elk team staat onder leiding van 1 Product Owner. Onze ambitie is om Risk Data beschikbaar te krijgen vanuit ons DataWareHouse. Wij denken mee met onze stakeholders hoe we de gevraagde Risk informatie uit de verschillende bronnen beschikbaar kunnen maken. Dat doen wij door het maken van inzichtelijke rapportages.


De sfeer in ons team? Die is informeel en positief. We denken graag in pragmatische oplossingen en vinden hard werken niet erg. Zeker niet omdat we ook voldoende ruimte hebben en maken voor ontspanning. Omdat we onderling contact belangrijk vinden, treffen we elkaar op 1 vaste dag op kantoor. Daarnaast kun je naar wens op kantoor of vanuit huis werken.
  

  

Wat krijg je van ons?  

Deze functie valt in schaal 11 met een salarisrange tussen de €4.107 en € 6.318 bruto p/mnd o.b.v. 36 uur. Daarnaast kun je rekenen op:

* Een 36-urige werkweek, flexibel in te delen met bijvoorbeeld 4x9. 32 uur is bespreekbaar.
* Vakantiegeld en een dertiende maand, waarbij je via het individueel keuzebudget (IKB) zelf kiest wanneer je dit ontvangt.
* 208,8 verlofuren o.b.v. fulltime dienstverband ongeacht je leeftijd.
* Een goede collectieve pensioenregeling.
* Alle vrijheid om zelf je ideale werkplek te bepalen. Thuiswerken is bij ons heel normaal.
* Een persoonlijk opleidingsbudget van € 750,- per jaar, naast de standaard opleidingsmogelijkheden.
* Iedere 5 jaar een budget van € 900,- om jouw thuiswerkplek in te richten.
* Een NS-Business Card én een vergoeding per km als je naar werk fietst.
* Een fietsplan om voordelig een fiets aan te schaffen.
* Gedeeltelijk doorbetaald vrijwilligerswerk.
* Een vitaliteitsprogramma met workshops en coaching voor jouw mentale en fysieke gezondheid.

Een laptop en een mobiele telefoon.

Bij Achmea willen we als werkgever onze (potentiële) collega’s net zo’n onvergetelijke ervaring geven als onze klanten. Die ervaring gaan we realiseren door ons op medewerkersreizen te richten.

Je begrijpt de technische inhoud en kan de vertaling maken naar de collega’s buiten het eigen vakgebied. Je wil op zoveel mogelijk medewerkers zoveel mogelijk impact hebben en denkt daarom vanuit het perspectief van de medewerker. Je bent iemand die graag samen met anderen aan een oplossing werkt. Dat is niet alleen leuker, maar daar worden de oplossing en jijzelf alleen maar beter van!

  

* Daarnaast ben je iemand die van aanpakken houdt, een conceptuele denker die initiatief neemt en creatieve oplossingen aandraagt, analytisch, leergierig en communicatief is.

* Jij weet welk verhaal je moet vertellen: van HR professional tot aan senior management, jouw stakeholders krijgen de informatie die ze nodig hebben voor de juiste beslissingen;
* Ervaring met Agile werken en affiniteit met het HR domein is een pre.

Als medewerker bij Achmea zet jij je elke dag in voor een gezonde, veilige én duurzame toekomst. En daar belonen we je graag voor!

Maar er is meer!

 **34-urige werkweek**  

Een 34-urige werkweek is bij Achmea de standaard! Je werkt dan bijvoorbeeld 4 dagen van 8,5 uur. Zo heb je nóg meer tijd voor vrijwilligerswerk, een goed boek, mantelzorg óf jouw favoriete sport!

Onder de noemer All You Can Learn volg je opleidingen, cursussen en trainingen. De wereld van leren en ontwikkelen ligt bij ons aan je voeten!

Join us on our journey as Splunk Solution Engineer, and enjoy a culture of inclusiveness, disruption, and fun while selling smart and winning big.
What’s the role of a Solution Engineer at Splunk?* You will technically own, discover, position, prove and deliver the key technical elements of a sales cycle to achieve a ‘technical win’ within large scale and complex customer environments. You’ll use a range of communication styles, a range of technology skills and experiences and a range of soft skills and people skills to develop trust relationships with both your sales colleagues and your customers.
* You will be an advocate and ambassador for Splunk through your professional social media, industry and marketing events and supporting pipeline generation activities
* You will collaborate with your customer contacts, and build them into Splunk champions, by helping them to understand how Splunk can help them to solve some of their most challenging problems and help them achieve their objectives.

* Technically Astute: You enjoy the detail, even if you don’t always need to express it. You have a thirst for up-to-date knowledge of the technologies and solutions that businesses use to be successful as they transform.
* Confidence: But not arrogant – you have the confidence that comes from the knowledge that your product is rock solid, and the ability to transmit this confidence to a customer. That means you might sit down with a customer already using your product to show them how they might use it even better!
* Business Savvy: You understand how businesses are organized, how they achieve their desired results, what challenges they are likely to face, what solutions they need and what transformations they could make with your solutions.
* A growth mindset: You build in time to develop your skills, knowledge, experience or capabilities. You look beyond the current opportunity towards the wider set of opportunities that could exist in a prospect.
* A Collaborator: You understand that selling is a team game, so you spend time developing your network of colleagues and partners to achieve your success – and theirs.
* Competitive: If you’re in it, you want to win it!
* Fun: Getting the job done and enjoying & generating fun don’t need to be mutually exclusive.
* The candidate must be based in the Netherlands and be fluent in Dutch and English.


Helpful technical skills or experience (not all required, but consider how Splunk could benefit from your background)* Domain knowledge and experience in any of the following areas: IT infrastructure, Cloud Technologies, Application Delivery, Business Analytics or Log Management

Je ontwikkelt de dialogen, waarbij je verantwoordelijk bent voor het correct herkennen van klantvragen uit de data en het stellen van de juiste vragen (vanuit de chatbot) om op maat gemaakte antwoorden te bieden. Dit vereist het gebruik van verschillende technieken, variërend van IBM Watson Assistant tot LLM’s zoals ChatGPT. Hiervoor is een uitstekende programmeervaardigheid, NLP/NLU kennis en het kunnen vertalen van klantbehoeftes naar oplossingen vereist. Verder vind je het leuk om je te verdiepen in de nieuwste technieken rondom chatbots, zoals de OpenAI services, die beschikbaar zijn binnen Achmea.

 **Hoe ziet je dag eruit?**


Je bent bezig met het implementeren van een nieuw dialoog voor Ziv die gevoed wordt vanuit ons 360 graden klantbeeld. Naast de technische uitdaging om dit voor elkaar te krijgen, wil je je collega’s in je multidisciplinaire team overtuigen dat jouw dialoog opzet gaat helpen om de klantbehoeftes in te vullen. Hiervoor geef je in de middag een presentatie waarin je ze meeneemt in de dialoog opzet en hoe deze in de praktijk werkt. Na deze geslaagde meeting bespreek je de verdere ontwikkeling van de code guidelines met je collega data scientists om zoveel uniform te werken binnen jullie data science processen.

Would you like to do your PhD in a project together with partners from various disciplines and in close collaboration with the hospital? Are you interested in the digital care transformation and in being part of a co-creation process in the area of respiratory diseases? For the project 'DACIL' we are looking for a PhD candidate (4 years, 1 fte) who will be closely involved in the development and evaluation of a digital companion that guides COPD patients to diagnose disease deterioration themselves using AI-supported non-invasive and continuous voice monitoring in their home environment.

  


**Job Description**  

The DACIL project is set up by an interdisciplinary consortium. The project aims to promote the autonomy, independence and self-reliance of people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This is done by providing COPD patients with an artificial intelligence (AI) supported, personalised digital companion used at home that detects disease deterioration by voice and wearables and stimulates and supports a sustainable, positive, and healthy lifestyle to prevent disease deterioration. In DACIL, researchers from different backgrounds (law, medicine, sociology, data science, psychology) join hands together with patients and other relevant parties involved in COPD care. The work of the PhD candidate focuses on the requirements, wishes and expectations of COPD patients (taken into account inclusivity, digital literacy) for the design, usability and feasibility of this personalised digital voice companion. The voice companion includes (1) a function to detect COPD disease deteriorations through voice recognition (and devices) and (2) lifestyle modules to support COPD patients to adapt a healthy lifestyle by personalised support. Within the project, we work closely with data scientists, other research departments within the university and other parties in the Netherlands. The PhD candidate will be supervised by people from the department of Health Promotion at Maastricht University, the Athena institute in Amsterdam and the department of Respiratory Medicine at Maastricht UMC+. The PhD candidate will also be involved in teaching activities within the Digital Technology and Care track within the Bachelor of Health Sciences and the Master of Health and Digital Transformation.

  

  

The tasks of the PhD candidate will include supporting the development of the voice companion through Design Thinking and co-creation methodologies, embedding the companion in practice, and conducting usability and feasibility studies. This is close collaboration with a patient advisory group. Qualitative and quantitative research methods will both be used. The research should result in a dissertation. The researcher will be appointed to the Department of Health Services Research at Maastricht University.

  


**Requirements**  

We are looking for an enthusiastic researcher with excellent Dutch and English written and oral communication skills, a flexible attitude, perseverance, and resilience. Being able to plan and organize well is a requirement. The researcher should have an affinity for health innovations, find it easy to connect with patients and health professionals and see it as a challenge to develop and evaluate care innovations in an interdisciplinary context. A completed degree in health sciences, medicine, behavioral science, psychology, social sciences or related field, affinity with the topic of the digital transformation of care and experience with qualitative research methods, and especially with co-creation and design thinking, would fit the profile well.

***Explainable AI for Crowd Dynamics: Predict and Assess Risk with Data. Join us to develop AI models for better decision-making in crowd crisis management.***

  


Job description


A major challenge in crises is the combination of complexity, time pressure and moral decisions. AI has the potential to support crowd crises decisions, yet the increasing use of AI has led to a debate about the legal and ethical implications.



In this PhD project, our primary focus is to harness the capabilities of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to better understand and manage crowd dynamics by integrating diverse data sets that include contextual information such as weather conditions, social media sentiment, and specific event characteristics. The objective is to develop predictive models that not only forecast crowd behaviors under various scenarios but also explain the underlying reasons for such predictions to facilitate transparent decision-making. This involves creating advanced AI algorithms capable of handling real-time data, ensuring data accuracy, and overcoming the challenges posed by the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of crowd movements. By improving the interpretability of AI outputs, stakeholders—from event organizers to city planners and emergency response teams—can make more informed decisions, enhancing safety and efficiency during large-scale public events.



The research will proceed through several progressive phases, each building upon the insights and technologies developed in the preceding one. Initially, we will focus on the development and validation of predictive and forecasting models for crowd management, utilizing regression trees, ensemble models, and techniques like XGBoost for feature selection and interpretability. Subsequent phases will involve the integration and categorization of risks using XAI to assess and predict potential incident scenarios and their impacts. This multi-disciplinary approach will extend into crowdsourcing and gamification strategies to collect diverse data, which will be used to continuously train and refine our models. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust, scalable system that not only predicts and categorizes risks but also provides actionable, data-driven advice on crowd management interventions. These interventions will be optimized through continuous learning frameworks and evolutionary algorithms, ensuring that the system evolves in response to new data and changing environments.



The position is a part of the AI-COMPASS team of three PhD researchers that will collectively research crowd crisis management at the TU Delft. This position is embedded at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) and will be jointly supervised with the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management (TPM). As such, the candidate will be joining a vibrant and growing community. You will be supervised by Prof. Serge Hoogendoorn and Prof. Tina Comes, and you will closely collaborate with Dr. Sascha Hoogendoorn-Lanser. This embedding ensures access to a broad network of partners in research, policy and practice. You may also gain experience in supervising MSc students and engage in teaching and training. Via our network and tailored mentoring, we will create opportunities for you to develop your career through support for conferences, collaborations and training possibilities.


Requirements


You are a highly motivated and enthusiastic researcher with the ambition to conduct high-quality interdisciplinary research that pushes the boundaries of human-centred AI research in crises. Specifically:


* You have a Master’s degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, or a related field.
* You have strong programming skills and experience with machine learning tools and techniques.
* You have excellent analytical and problem-solving abilities
* You have excellent study results and excellent command of English. Dutch language skills are a plus.

You will work on the project “Ice-ocean interactions in West Antarctica during rapid transitions in past warm climates”. In this position, you map out in detail the geographic distribution of dinoflagellate cyst species and organic geochemical biomarkers around West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula.


**Your job**
------------


You are expected to generate organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst assemblage data from surface sediment samples available at the British Antarctic Survey. In addition, the project involves the generation of organic geochemical biomarker data from the same surface sediment samples, both with the aim of improving their accuracy as proxy for surface oceanographic conditions. Alongside this, there are opportunities to generate sedimentological and inorganic geochemical data as well, which are indicative of both ocean and ice dynamics. Towards the end of the project, you will contribute to the application of the improved proxies to reconstruct surface ocean change during prominent deglaciation phases in West-Antarctica.


The position is part of a larger interdisciplinary project, that includes a PhD candidate that focuses on the paleoceanographic reconstructions during the Pleistocene and Pliocene, with whom you will closely collaborate. Both positions are funded by the Dutch National Science Foundation NWO in a special call of the Polar Programme in collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey. The positions are based in the Marine Palynology & Paleoceanography group at the Department of Earth Sciences in Utrecht, NL. Regular visits to the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK, are foreseen.


**Your qualities**
------------------


We are looking for a candidate with commitment to overcome the challenges faced in working with complicated material from close to Antarctica. This project really seeks a problem-solver, someone who isn’t let down by the first disappointment. You demonstrate the capability to contribute yourself to the planning and organisation of your work as well as that of the PhD, with a keen interest in taking initiatives for the direction in which the projects develop.


You must have successfully completed a PhD programme in Earth Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Biology, micropaleontology, palynology or a related discipline by the time the position starts. You have:


* experience in palynology/micropaleontology, including microscope work (required);
* experience in working in a laboratory (required);
* evident passion for teamwork, and willingness to travel (also abroad);
* adequate social/verbal/communication skills.


Preferably, you also have:


* a strong interest in paleoclimate/paleoceanography;
* experience in proxy development;
* experience in (in)organic geochemistry.


Due to the international character of our research, good command of spoken and written English is essential. We highly encourage applicants from all members of our community and of diverse backgrounds to join us.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position initially for one year, with an extension to three years in total upon a successful assessment in the first year;
* a working week of 38 hours and a gross monthly salary between €3,720 and €4,332 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale 10.3-10.7 under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth.

**About us**
------------


A better future for everyone. This ambition motivates our scientists in executing their leading research and inspiring teaching. At Utrecht University, the various disciplines collaborate intensively towards major strategic themes. Our focus is on Dynamics of Youth, Institutions for Open Societies, Life Sciences and Pathways to Sustainability. Sharing science, shaping tomorrow.


Utrecht University’s Faculty of Geosciences studies the Earth: from the Earth’s core to its surface, including man’s spatial and material utilisation of the Earth – always with a focus on sustainability and innovation. With 3,400 students (BSc and MSc) and 720 staff, the faculty is a strong and challenging organisation. The Faculty of Geosciences is organised in four Departments: Earth Sciences, Human Geography & Spatial Planning, Physical Geography, and Sustainable Development.


The department of Earth Sciences conducts teaching and research across the full range of the solid Earth and environmental Earth sciences, with activities in almost all areas of geology, geochemistry, geophysics, biogeology and hydrogeology. The department hosts a highly international tenured staff of over 50 scientists and more than 110 PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers. Our research programme spans four intertwined themes: Climate & Life, Earth interior, Earth materials, and Environmental Earth Sciences. We house or have access to a wide variety of world-class laboratories.


The Marine Palynology & Paleoceanography group focuses with four permanent staff members on paleoceanographic and paleoenvironmental reconstructions in the entire Phanerozoic, specifically by looking at organic microfossils, usually in close collaboration with additional disciplines in the department and abroad. There is a close link between this project and the paleoclimate research within the virtual Netherlands Earth System Science Centre (NESSC), which focuses on tipping points within the climate system, and its successor, the Earth System Feedback Research Centre, which will run at least until 2035. This brings together a large cohort of PhD candidates in a national highly interdisciplinary and strongly collaborative (paleo-)climate community.


The department and its facilities are located at Utrecht Science Park. Utrecht is the fourth largest city in the Netherlands with a population of nearly 360,000 and forms a hub in the middle of the country. Its historical city centre and its modern central station can easily be reached from the Science Park by public transport or by a 15-minute bicycle ride. Utrecht boasts beautiful canals with extraordinary wharf cellars housing cafés and terraces by the water, as well as a broad variety of shops and boutiques.

You will work on the project “Ice-ocean interactions in West Antarctica during rapid transitions in past warm climates”. In this four-year study, you will reconstruct in detail the oceanographic changes close to the West-Antarctic ice sheet during prominent deglaciations in the Pliocene and Pleistocene.


**Your job**
------------


You are expected to generate multiple records of organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst assemblages crossing glacial-interglacial transitions from sediment cores that were collected by the British Antarctic Survey and through the International Ocean Discovery Programme. In addition, the project involves the generation of organic geochemical biomarker records from the same sedimentary records, which will complement the reconstruction of ecosystem, ocean and climate variability. Alongside this, there are opportunities to generate sedimentological and inorganic geochemical data on the sediment core as well, which are indicative of both ocean and ice dynamics.


A personalised training programme will be set up, mutually agreed on recruitment, which will reflect both your training needs and career objectives. As part of this training, up to 10% of your time will be dedicated to assisting in the BSc and MSc teaching programmes of the Earth Sciences department.


The position is part of a larger interdisciplinary project, that includes a postdoctoral researcher with whom you will closely collaborate. Both positions are funded by the Dutch National Science Foundation NWO in a special call of the Polar Programme in collaboration with the British Antarctic Survey. The positions are based in the Marine Palynology & Paleoceanography group at the Department of Earth Sciences in Utrecht, NL. Regular visits to the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK, are foreseen, e.g. for scientific discussions and to perform analyses.


**Your qualities**
------------------


We are looking for a candidate with commitment to overcome the challenges faced in working with complicated material from close to Antarctica. This project really seeks a problem-solver, one that isn’t let down by the first disappointment. You demonstrate the capability to contribute yourself to the planning and organisation of your work, with a keen interest in taking initiatives for the direction in which it develops.


You must have completed your MSc degree in Earth Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Biology or a related discipline by the time the position starts. Preferably, you also have:


* experience or strong interest in paleoclimate/paleoceanography;
* experience in palynology/micropaleontology is highly appreciated;
* experience in working in a laboratory or willingness to learn;
* experience in (in)organic geochemistry is a pro;
* a love for microscope work and teamwork, willingness to travel (also abroad);
* adequate social/verbal/communication skills.


Due to the international character of our research, good command of spoken and written English is essential. We highly encourage applicants from all members of our community and of diverse backgrounds to join us.


**Our offer**
-------------


We offer:


* a position for one year, with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the first year;
* a working week of 36 hours and a gross monthly salary between €2,770 and €3,539 in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products. We also offer access to additional employee benefits through our Terms of Employment Options Model. In this way, we encourage our employees to continue to invest in their growth. For more information, please visit Working at Utrecht University.


**About us**
------------


A better future for everyone. This ambition motivates our scientists in executing their leading research and inspiring teaching. At Utrecht University, the various disciplines collaborate intensively towards major strategic themes. Our focus is on Dynamics of Youth, Institutions for Open Societies, Life Sciences and Pathways to Sustainability. Sharing science, shaping tomorrow.


Utrecht University’s Faculty of Geosciences studies the Earth: from the Earth’s core to its surface, including man’s spatial and material utilisation of the Earth – always with a focus on sustainability and innovation. With 3,400 students (BSc and MSc) and 720 staff, the faculty is a strong and challenging organisation. The Faculty of Geosciences is organised in four Departments: Earth Sciences, Human Geography & Spatial Planning, Physical Geography, and Sustainable Development.


The department of Earth Sciences conducts teaching and research across the full range of the solid Earth and environmental Earth sciences, with activities in almost all areas of geology, geochemistry, geophysics, biogeology and hydrogeology. The department hosts a highly international tenured staff of over 50 scientists and more than 110 PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers. Our research programme spans four intertwined themes: Climate & Life, Earth interior, Earth materials, and Environmental Earth Sciences. We house or have access to a wide variety of world-class laboratories.


The Marine Palynology & Paleoceanography group focuses with four permanent staff members on paleoceanographic and paleoenvironmental reconstructions in the entire Phanerozoic, specifically by looking at organic microfossils, usually in close collaboration with additional disciplines in the department and abroad. There is a close link between this project and the paleoclimate research within the virtual Netherlands Earth System Science Centre (NESSC), which focuses on tipping points within the climate system, and its successor, the Earth System Feedback Research Centre, which will run at least until 2035. This brings together a large cohort of PhD candidates in a national highly interdisciplinary and strongly collaborative (paleo-)climate community.


The department and its facilities are located at Utrecht Science Park. Utrecht is the fourth largest city in the Netherlands with a population of nearly 360,000 and forms a hub in the middle of the country. Its historical city centre and its modern central station can easily be reached from the Science Park by public transport or by a 15-minute bicycle ride. Utrecht boasts beautiful canals with extraordinary wharf cellars housing cafés and terraces by the water, as well as a broad variety of shops and boutiques.

----------------


Are you passionate about investigating workforce challenges from the perspective of psychology, health sciences and medicine? Are you interested in applying these disciplines in clarifying risks of physicians’ stress to their work performance in providing patient care? If so, we invite you to join our team as a PhD student to unravel the impact of job demands, job resources and physicians’ work stress on diagnostic errors in emergency medicine.


**Job description**
-------------------


Emergency medicine physicians see patients who urgently need care. One of their key tasks is to determine the severity of the situation and identify possible diagnoses. This diagnostic process is challenged by diseases with variable presentations, while emergency physicians deal with interruptions and time pressure in a stressful work environment. This environment is characterized by abundant job demands (e.g. workloads) – and a lack of job resources (e.g. perceived support). Prolonged exposure to such demands and (lack of) resources increases work stress. This is especially problematic as excessive work stress hinders physicians in performing well in providing care, yet it is unknown how the diagnostic process specifically is affected. Therefore, there is a knowledge gap on whether and how stressed physicians exposed to excessive job demands and limited resources are more likely to commit more diagnostic errors.


This knowledge gap is addressed in the current PhD trajectory, by clarifying how job demands and resources, and work stress affect physicians’ diagnostic performance in emergency medicine. Your primary task as a PhD student involves conducting scientific research together with your supervisory team. This involves coordinating the data collection of studies and performing data analyses. Furthermore, you will be tasked with the writing of scientific articles, which will culminate into your PhD thesis. In addition to research tasks, you will have the opportunity to enrol in relevant courses that align with both the project requirements and your personal academic interests and you will be able to teach in our Bachelor Health Sciences and/or Master Health Care Management.


The research is a collaboration of the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management (ESHPM) and the Erasmus MC.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* A research master or master degree in psychology, health sciences, human resource studies, (interdisciplinary) social sciences or a related discipline.
* Interest in (occupational health) psychology, health care quality and the work environment of physicians.
* Strong analytical and research skills.
* Experience with quantitative research and statistical analyses, including computer skills (e.g. SPSS, Stata, SAS or R)
* Interest in qualitative research
* Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English and preferably also Dutch.
* You should be able to work both independently and as a member of a large multidisciplinary team (psychologists, sociologists, health scientists, physicians).


**Employment conditions and benefits**
--------------------------------------


We offer you an internationally oriented and varied job in an enthusiastic team, with excellent working conditions in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU).


The start date of this position is 1 October 2024 (or in mutual agreement) and you will be basedat at campus Woudestein at Erasmus School of Health Policy & Management (ESHPM). This position is for 1 fte. The salary ranges from a minimum of € 2.770 to a maximum of € 3.539 gross per month Scale PhD on a fulltime basis (38 hours), in accordance with the CAO-NU.

-------------------


The EUV-emitting laser-produced plasmas are generated from tin targets carefully shaped (hydrodynamically deformed) by a series of laser “pre-pulses”. The ability to shape & control these tin targets is critical for efficient generation of EUV light for current and future light sources. Such abilities will originate from understanding the driving physical processes.


You will join a team of several PhD students and postdocs and have as an objective to design & execute experiments to understand the fluid dynamic deformation, fragmentation, and vaporization of laser-impacted thin liquid tin targets: what really happens when a laser pulse hits a tin droplet? New fluid dynamics understanding will lead to new capabilities for laser-tailoring targets. These new capabilities will allow target tailoring to optimally couple to laser light to produce hot-and-dense plasma. You (and the rest of the team) will be responsible for the setup, execution, analysis, and interpretation of the experiments.


**Qualifications**
------------------


You have (or soon will have) a MSc physics or applied physics. Knowledge about fluid mechanics and/or experimental laser physics and/or (laser) spectroscopy is advantageous. Programming skills (Python) are welcomed. Good verbal and written communication skills (in English) are required.


**Work environment**
--------------------


The Advanced Research Center for Nanolithography (ARCNL) focuses on the fundamental physics and chemistry involved in current and future key technologies in nanolithography, primarily for the semiconductor industry. ARCNL is a public-private partnership between the Dutch Research Council (NWO), the University of Amsterdam (UvA), the VU University Amsterdam (VU), and associate partner the University of Groningen (UG), and the semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML. ARCNL is located at the Amsterdam Science Park, The Netherlands, and has a size of approximately 100 scientists and support staff. See also www.arcnl.nl


Advanced semiconductor devices are produced using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light at just 13.5nm wavelength. The recent revolutionary introduction of EUV lithography (EUVL) was the culmination of several decades of collaborative work between industry and science – a Project Apollo of the digital age. EUVL is powered by light that is produced in the interaction of high-energy CO2-gas laser pulses with molten tin microdroplets. The use of such lasers leads to low overall efficiency in converting electrical power to useful EUV light. Replacing gas lasers with much more efficient solid-state lasers may significantly improve efficiency, as well as output power. It is currently however unclear what laser wavelength, and what plasma ‘recipe’ should be used. This is because we lack understanding of the underlying complex physics. The goal of project MOORELIGHT is to deliver the missing insight.


**Working conditions**
----------------------


The position is intended as full-time (40 hours / week, 12 months / year) appointment in the service of the Netherlands Foundation of Scientific Research Institutes (NWO-I) for the duration of four years, with a starting salary of gross € 2,781 per month and a range of employment benefits. After successful completion of the PhD research a PhD degree will be granted at a Dutch University. Several courses are offered, specially developed for PhD-students. ARCNL assists any new foreign PhD-student with housing and visa applications and compensates their transport costs and furnishing expenses.


Besides the above mentioned conditions ARCNL offers:


* Responsibility over a setup including state-of-the-art droplet generators and laser system.
* The ability to improve your experimental skills in extensive experimental campaigns that can be designed with a lot of freedom.
* Collaboration with the in-house theory group, allowing you to develop a thorough understanding of the underlying target dynamics.
* A wide range of existing (image) data analysis tools, allowing you to apply and develop your data analysis skills.
* Cooperation within a large team of PhD students and postdoc and with a large industrial partner.

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack.

Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics

Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Als Azure Data Engineer kun je hier een belangrijke bijdrage aan leveren! Binnen DNB is er steeds meer behoefte aan schaalbare en robuuste dataoplossingen. Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.

En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.

Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.

Rabobank maakt het verschil voor haar meer dan 7 miljoen klanten in 40 landen door vernieuwingen in de financiële dienstverlening te stimuleren, zodat al haar klanten op ieder gewenst optimaal hun financiële zaken kunnen regelen.


Maar dat is zeker niet het enige. De Rabobank is een coöperatieve bank met een missie. Samen met klanten, leden en partners zet de Rabobank zich in voor een sterkere leefomgeving en voor de grote maatschappelijke uitdagingen van nu, met als uitgangspunt dat er samen meer bereikt wordt dan alleen. Die missie kan alleen waargemaakt worden doordat Rabobank een krachtige bank is die efficiënt werkt.


Daarnaast is Rabobank actief betrokken bij veel maatschappelijke initiatieven. Een deel van de winst wordt geïnvesteerd in de samenleving. Verder weg, door te zorgen dat boeren een eerlijke prijs krijgen voor hun producten. En dichtbij, door in heel Nederland samen buurten beter te maken. Zo’n 1250 organisaties in sport en cultuur die voor veel mensen een tweede thuis zijn worden ondersteund. Een ander voorbeeld is het project met Humanitas, waarin mensen worden geholpen die financiële problemen hebben hun thuisadministratie op orde te krijgen. Een derde voorbeeld is dat samen met Vluchtelingenwerk Nederland 1.500 vluchtelingen worden geholpen bij het vinden van een goed passende baan.


Om haar kerntaak blijvend te realiseren heeft Rabobank een ambitieus plan opgesteld waarin het creëren van een optimale Engineering Journey een belangrijke pijler is. Er dient veel te veranderen in de wijze waarop engineers ondersteund worden van idee tot een werkende oplossing. Daarin is de communicatie tussen applicaties een cruciaal onderdeel.

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

Een rol met impact: die heb je als data-analist bij ons Sanctieteam in Utrecht zeker. Jij draagt bij aan een rechtvaardig en integer financieel stelsel. En tilt de Volksbank op het gebied van data naar een nog hoger niveau.


Jij speelt als de data-analist in ons Sanctieteam een sleutelrol in het screeningsproces. Dat doe je door op basis van requirements diverse databestanden te analyseren en zo afwijkende transacties en risicovolle (potentiële) klanten in kaart te brengen. Belangrijk, want bij de Volksbank willen we weten wie onze klanten zijn. Bijvoorbeeld om snel in te kunnen grijpen als we met iemand zaken doen die op een sanctielijst staat. Het aantal sancties en het aantal transacties groeien snel, waardoor een goede screening hoog op onze prioriteitenlijst staat. Daarnaast verandert wet- en regelgeving regelmatig.


Data zijn voor ons van doorslaggevend belang voor het kennen van onze (potentiële) klanten. Daarom werken we steeds meer datagedreven. Jij bouwt naast je analysewerk volop mee aan een datagedreven organisatie, waarbij je focust op een optimale inrichting van onze screening. Zo adviseer je over verbeteringen in onze systemen, processen en procedures om de screening zo effectief en efficiënt mogelijk uit te voeren.


Je krijgt veel vrijheid en autonomie, want wij werken agile. Jouw visie op data telt echt mee en is bepalend voor je team én de hele bank. Bij ons tref je ook de ideale omgeving om verder te groeien binnen jouw vakgebied. Verspreid over de hele organisatie werken namelijk data-analisten die je ontmoet in ons gilde. Hier delen we best practices en vragen we elkaar om hulp.


Hier kom je te werken


Het Sanctieteam is jouw thuisbasis. We zijn een multidisciplinair team van 16 collega’s: inhoudelijke experts, IT-specialisten en kenners van processen. In korte tijd zijn we gegroeid met veel nieuwe collega’s. Daar merk je trouwens weinig van; we werken samen alsof we elkaar al jaren kennen. We komen in elk geval één keer per week samen op kantoor in Utrecht.


Jouw kwaliteiten


Hoe jij bekend staat? Als doortastend en communicatief sterk. Zo vertaal je ruwe gegevens efficiënt naar heldere informatie waar je collega’s écht iets mee kunnen. Met je scherpe analytische blik ben je continu op zoek naar verbeterpotentieel. Bovendien werk je graag samen en houd je, ook onder druk, het hoofd koel.


Verder heb je:

* Hbo werk- en denkniveau
* Ervaring met grote datasets en het opschonen en transformeren van data.
* Ervaring met programmeertalen, zoals Python/PySpark, SQL en R.
* Ervaring met data-analysetools, zoals Excel en Microsoft Power BI of Jupyter.


Wat krijg je van ons?


Onze salarisschaal loopt van € 3.609,86 en € 5.553,63. Jouw salaris voor deze functie ligt tussen de € 4.165,22 en € 5.553,63 euro bruto per maand op basis van 36 uur per week.


Daarnaast kun je rekenen op:


* Een 36-urige werkweek, flexibel in te delen met bijvoorbeeld 4x9. 32 uur is bespreekbaar.
* Vakantiegeld en een dertiende maand, waarbij je via het individueel keuzebudget (IKB) zel kiest wanneer je dit ontvangt.
* 208,8 verlofuren o.b.v. fulltime dienstverband ongeacht je leeftijd.
* Een goede collectieve pensioenregeling.
* Alle vrijheid om zelf je ideale werkplek te bepalen. Thuiswerken is bij ons heel normaal.
* Een persoonlijk opleidingsbudget van € 750,- per jaar, naast de standaard opleidingsmogelijkheden.
* Iedere 5 jaar een budget van € 900,- om jouw thuiswerkplek in te richten.
* Een NS-Business Card én een vergoeding per km als je naar werk fietst.
* Een fietsplan om voordelig een fiets aan te schaffen.
* 2 werkdagen doorbetaald vrijwilligerswerk.
* Een vitaliteitsprogramma met workshops en coaching voor jouw mentale en fysieke gezondheid.
Een laptop en telefoon.  
*

-------------------


The Electronic Systems (ES) group within the Department of Electrical Engineering of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and Philips Image Guided Therapy Systems (Philips IGT-S) are seeking to hire an outstanding EngD candidate within the field of data driven value-based healthcare in image guided therapy.


**Candidate**


In image guided therapy the real-time x-ray image stream is essential in conducting the intervention. As a consequence, so far the industry has been reluctant to embrace cloud technology, because of latency and reliability considerations. However, cloud cluster computing also enables sophisticated AI algorithms that cannot be catered by local computation resources.


This EngD project will consist of creating cloud technologies for real-time interventional imaging. This position is part of six EngD vacancies at Philips IGT-S which will be released over the next year. The EngD candidates will work within an expert team at Philips, and their assignments will address the following aspects:


* Reliable and low-latency network solutions, with appropriate redundancy and fallback mechanisms.
* Cloud solutions for real-time image processing as part of a dependable medical grade processing chain.


**Electronic Systems group at TU/e and Philips IGT-S**


The Electronic Systems group consists of six full professors, three associate professors, five assistant professors, several postdocs, about 40 EngD and PhD candidates and support staff. The ES group is world-renowned for its design automation and embedded systems research. It is our ambition to provide a scientific basis for design trajectories of electronic systems, ranging from digital circuits to cyber-physical systems. The trajectories are constructive and lead to high quality, cost-effective systems with predictable properties (functionality, timing, reliability, power dissipation, and cost).


Philips Image Guided Therapy is a business category within Royal Philips. The Image Guided Therapy department focuses on developing innovative medical devices and solutions that enable minimally invasive and image-guided procedures in the field of healthcare. These technologies are designed to help healthcare professionals perform procedures such as interventional cardiology, radiology, and surgery with greater precision and efficiency. Philips Image Guided Therapy solutions often incorporate advanced imaging, data analytics, and visualization technologies to enhance patient care and improve clinical outcomes. https://www.philips.com/healthcare/e/image-guided-therapy.


**Job requirements**
--------------------


We are looking for excellent candidates that add value to the ES group and match the following profile:


* A master's degree in Electrical Engineering or related disciplines with excellent grades.
* Excellent knowledge of computer architectures and hardware/software design.
* Solid programming skills (e.g., in C or C++).
* A team player that enjoys working in multicultural teams.
* Good communication and organization skills.
* Excellent English language skills (writing and presenting).

**Conditions of employment**
----------------------------


We offer a fixed-term, 2-year position in a research group with an excellent reputation, including:


* Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the *Collective Labour Agreement* for Dutch Universities, scale TOIO (€2,618).
* A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
* To support you during your EngD and to prepare you for the rest of your career, you will have free access to a personal development program for EngD trainees.
* An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
* An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
* Family-friendly initiatives are in place, such as an international spouse program, and excellent on-campus children day care and sports facilities.
* A Staff Immigration Team and a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) for international candidates.

**Faculteit/Dienst:** Faculteit der Natuurw., Wiskunde & Informatica
**Opleidingsniveau:** Master
**Functie type:** Promotieplaats
**Sluitingsdatum:** 18.08.2024
**Vacaturenummer:** 13165
We have two positions available for a PhD Student in Cellular imaging and in Neuroscience. The two positions are funded by a grant from NWO “Visualizing and manipulating synaptic AMPA-receptor plasticity with a new molecular toolkit”. The two PhD students are expected to closely collaborate within this project.  


The two positions are embedded respectively in the following two UvA/SILS research groups:  


Molecular Cytology studies the dynamic architecture of living cells. By employing genetic encoded fluorescent biosensors we analyze the molecular interactions between signaling molecules and flow of information across and in the plane of the membrane of living mammalian cells. We aim to understand how cells respond to internal and external cues using advanced microscopy tools.  


**Project 1**: Engineering of novel tools for visualization and manipulation of signaling molecules that drive synaptic plasticity.  


This project builds on our efforts to engineer biosensors ad optogenetic tools that can be used in relevant complex biological systems to interrogate signaling networks. In this project protein engineering and microscopy-based screening will be applied to generate new biosensors that have lifetime contrast, as these have advantageous properties for quantitative imaging in complex systems. In addition, we aim to generate genetically encoded components that can manipulate cAMP levels or other signaling components that potentially control synaptic AMPA-receptor plasticity.  


Cellular and Computational Neuroscience is part of the SILS Neuroscience theme and investigates the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity mechanism that underlie learning and memory, at the level of cellular and network neuroscience using electrophysiological, live-imaging, pharmacological and molecular techniques.  


**Project 2**: Understanding the synaptic plasticity mechanisms that underlie memory retrieval  


In this project the synaptic plasticity processes will be examined that underlie memory retrieval in the hippocampus. We hypothesize that noradrenaline signalling selectively increases the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP at actively communicating synapses, thereby increasing conductance of AMPA-receptors at these synapses. To study these molecular processes, whole-cell electrophysiology will be combined with live-imaging and optogenetics. This project is directly relevant to increase our understanding of how memories can be reactivated and why memory retrieval is impaired in early Alzheimer’s disease.

The Faculty of Science and the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) are looking for:

**PhD candidate | Environmental impact assessment of pollution at the ecosystem level (0.8-1.0 fte)**

**Vacancy number: (14994)**


**Background**


The freshwater system and its adjacent ecosystems host countless species because of their need of water. These are the earths’ natural capital and drivers of many ecosystem services we humans depend on. At the same time, the presence and effects of anthropogenic stress in the aquatic environment are multitude and ubiquitous. These include the omnipresence of chemical pollution such as the use of agricultural chemicals.


To relatively quickly assess the impacts of chemicals a standard risk assessment framework is in place. While valuable, the frameworks often lacks ecological realism. Researchers from Leiden University therefore experiment in outdoor freshwater experimental systems with natural food webs such as the “Levend Lab” (EN: “Living Lab”, https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/livinglab) to identify how biodiversity responds to the impacts of pesticides, fertilizers, invasive species and nanomaterials.


Using ecological theory, a large array of different experimental and statistical analytical methods are currently in practice to perform and analyze such experiments. The key challenge for the PhD candidate is to test these different forms of experimental and statistical analytical methods to identify stressor - ecosystem function relationships. The research will likely entail measuring different forms of aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem functionality followed by statistical modelling to infer causality of stressor impacts and their propagation through the ecosystem.


We invite prospective candidates to unravel the intricate network of species interactions between each other and their environment. The candidate will use new analytical methods and develops models and interpretation scenarios to identify how pollution impacts species and their role in ecosystem functionality.

**Key tasks:**

* *Perform* mesocosm pollution experiments in the ‘Levend Lab’ facility of Leiden University
* *Further develop* and test different types of statistical analyses at the community to ecosystem level
* *Advance* ecological theory by identifying the anthropological and natural drivers of species and their roles in ecosystems

**Selection criteria:**

* You should have an M.Sc. in a relevant field (environmental science, biology, ecology and/or ecotoxicology), but we also consider candidates from other related scientific fields.
* Experience with experimental field and laboratory skills and (aquatic) organism identifications are highly valued
* Strong background and interest in statistical analyses, data management, visualization and coding skills (in R, but Python also applies) is highly valued.
* You must be proficient in spoken and written English.
* You are a team player and have a collaborative attitude.


**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,800 staff and almost 6,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 150 FTE (including postdocs and PhD candidates) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

We offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 4 years based on performance. Salary ranges from € 2.770 gross per month in the first year to € 3.539 gross per month in the fourth year based on a full-time position (pay scale P in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities).


Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development and sabbatical leave. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break.


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website. Female researchers are also welcomed to join the Researchers In Science for Equality network of the Faculty if Science (rise.nu).

 #### **Who is Mews?**



We want to get to know you, so it's only fair we tell you a little bit about ourselves first. Mews has been transforming hospitality since 2012. What began in a single hotel in Prague now powers thousands of hotels around the world, as they pursue their mission to develop transformational solutions for brands and create remarkable experiences for guests.



Since the beginning, Mews embraced being different. Mews is not simply a property management system, but a connected hospitality cloud with products across the hotel ecosystem and more integrations than anyone else.



From global hospitality brands to independent properties, hoteliers join Mews because they recognize the power of innovation. They understand that they can benefit from hotel tech that drives efficiency, maximizes revenue, and improves guest happiness.



Powering over 5,000 customers across more than 85 countries, Mews Hospitality Cloud is designed to streamline operations for modern hoteliers, transform the guest experience and create more profitable businesses.



Ranked 24th in the FT 1000 list of the fastest-growing European companies in 2021, Mews has been recognized as the Best PMS by industry peers at the HotelTechAwards in both 2020 and 2024, consistently earning acclaim. Mews also achieved finalist status in 2021 and 2022. What's more, we take immense pride in being listed among the Best Places to Work in Hotel Tech during those same years and again this year. But our achievements don't stop there; Mews was also listed among the World's Best Hotel PMS Provider 2023 and as the World's Best Independent Hotel PMS Provider 2022 and 2023 by the World Travel Tech Awards.



 #### **Life at Mews**

That's what we do, but what about who we are? Mews' culture is special and difficult to capture in words, which makes writing this tricky. You'll experience the freedom to be yourself and the ability to watch your ideas come to life. You'll have an open line of communication and an open invitation to after-work drinks, be they virtual or in-person. Sometimes the work can be challenging and there can be a lot of it, but you'll always be able to rely on those around you.



Yes, we're ambitious and we move fast, but we know the value of fun and taking a breather. Every month we have a Wellness Wednesday, a day off that you can use to boost your health, whether that's a long lie-in, a trip to the gym, or anything in between. We have slack channels for almost every interest imaginable, and an all-company meeting every Friday gives you the chance to ask any question to our leadership team.



To get more of an idea what life at Mews is like, check out our Instagram .  

  

We're guided by our five key values; if you see yourself in them, it's time to get in touch.

  

#### **Everyone is welcome at Mews**



To reimagine the art of hospitality, we need teams who represent our global and diverse customers and users. Our differences make Mews, so we welcome people of all backgrounds and identities to work with us. Embracing different perspectives, trying new things and feeling safe to bring your authentic self to work. If this sounds like you and you're ready to join a global, innovative, and exciting community, we'd love to hear from you!

Are you looking to shape the future of human-AI collaboration in making important decisions? Join us in this fully funded PhD project! In the next four years, you will conduct scientific research to inform the design of new intelligent systems that excel at not only making decisions but also understand their human users in collaborative decision-making.


Are you looking to shape the future of human-AI collaboration in making important decisions? Join us in this fully funded PhD project! In the next four years, you will conduct scientific research to inform the design of new intelligent systems that excel at not only making decisions but also understand their human users in collaborative decision-making.


The recent developments in AI-assisted decision-making call for an emerging field of human-AI decision-making, i.e., the study of how to improve collaborative decision-making between AI algorithms and human users. Current research in human-AI decision making focuses on technical contributions, such as new algorithms and visualizations that help people understand AI’s decisions by providing explanations (i.e., explainable AI), but overlooks the opposite side of the problem, i.e., how to make AI understand the human decision-maker in the task environment. This is critical in improving the effectiveness and usability of the AI assistance.


In this project, we will explore the possibilities of tracking and inferring users’ mental states through real-time sensory data (e.g., physiological, eye-tracking, movement) and cognitive modeling (i.e., computational modeling of human cognition and decision-making). More specifically, we expect you to (1) study the literature and identify a few decision-making tasks and contexts where our approach has the most potential; (2) build data-driven and/or theory-based user models in the identified contexts of human-AI decision-making; and (3) conduct empirical studies to access the added values of the approach.


As a PhD candidate, you will work in the Human-Technology Interaction group at the Department of Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences. Since the research topic is at the intersection of psychology, human-computer interaction, and AI, you will be supervised by a team of researchers with complementary expertise: Prof. Dr. Chris Snijders (trust in AI, decision-making), Dr. Chao Zhang (human-AI interaction, cognitive modeling), and Dr. Linghan Zhang (signal processing, affective and behavioral computing). Furthermore, you will have access to TU/e’s PhD level courses and training, and are encouraged to collaborate with other researchers at the department and the Eindhoven Artificial Intelligence Systems Institute (EAISI). You are expected to publish your research findings in peer-reviewed journals and at international conferences. The PhD project will conclude a high-quality PhD dissertation on the proposed topic after four years.


**Job requirements**

-------------------


Are you eager to contribute to a still further improvement of ASML’s nanolithography technology, and are you fascinated by partial differential equations (PDEs) and machine learning?  

If yes, then this vacancy, a cooperation between ASML Research and TU/e’s Centre for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications, might be something for you.


**Job Description**  

Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) The PhD position is in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) of Eindhoven University of Technology. M&CS is the largest department of TU/e and one of the largest departments in the Netherlands in the area of mathematics and computer science. M&CS has research collaborations with the other departments at TU/e, with many companies in the Eindhoven area, and with universities and companies in the Netherlands and abroad. M&CS contributes to science and engineering by performing both fundamental and applied research. Through M&CS’s close relationship with the high-tech industry in the Eindhoven area, staff and students contribute directly to the development of relevant technological innovations. M&CS is organized in three different domains: mathematics, computer science, and data science. Each domain consists of several clusters. The mathematics domain has three clusters: CASA (Center for Analysis, Scientific Computing, and Applications), DM (Discrete Mathematics), and SPOR (Statistics, Probability, and Operations Research). The domain of computer science is organized into five different clusters: ALGA (Algorithms, Geometry and Applications), FSA (Formal System Analysis), IRIS (Interconnected Resource-aware Intelligent Systems), SEC (Security), and SET (Software Engineering and Technology). Data science has three clusters: DAI (Data and Artificial Intelligence), PA (Process Analytics), and VIS (Visualization). The PhD position for which this call is, is in the cluster CASA.


*Center for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications (CASA)*  

  

The research objective of CASA is to develop new and improve existing mathematical (both analytical and numerical) methods for a wide range of applications in science and engineering. Mathematics research within CASA is often driven by models from science and engineering, for instance by mathematical expressions of physical laws (often systems of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations). Stimulated by the immense growth in the availability and use of data, mathematics in CASA is also becoming data-driven, with a crucial role in this for machine learning. There is enormous potential for the use of data and machine learning (particularly neural networks) in analysis and scientific computing, in combination with the use of first-principle models. CASA is continuing its longstanding expertise and success in variational calculus, functional analysis, numerical methods for partial differential equations, numerical linear algebra, and model-order reduction methods while extending its research into the direction of data science, machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and high-performance computing.


*Knowledge and Physics-Informed Artificial Intelligence (KPAI)*


The availability and importance of data for the design, manufacturing, operation and maintenance of semiconductor machinery has increased significantly. Classical engineering methods can be augmented by data taken from observations in machines or from documented knowledge sources based upon earlier design and manufacturing steps. The translation of these diverse forms of information requires novel approaches that extract meaningful outputs, which are then utilizable for engineering goals.  

From the national program TKI (Top consortia for Knowledge and Innovation), funding has been acquired for the research program Knowledge and Physics Informed Artificial Intelligence (KPAI), including two PhD projects, each focused on a different type of source information. The program KPAI will be co-funded by and carried out in cooperation with ASML Research.  

The two PhD projects in the KPAI program are:


* Extraction and representation in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs) of the physics governing semiconductor manufacturing processes (model discovery).
* Information extraction from semi-structured sources of information and their representation in a knowledge graph and a large language model for trustworthy conversational AI.


Both projects will bring these two forms of information together in such a way that a tool is realized for quick support to engineers. The first of above two projects, for which the present call is, will be carried out in the cluster CASA, the second in the cluster DAI.


**Job requirements**
--------------------


We are looking for a talented, enthusiastic PhD candidate meeting the following requirements:


* Master degree in (applied) mathematics or related discipline.

* Creative pro-active team player with good analytical skills.
* Research-oriented attitude.
* Ability to work in interdisciplinary team and to collaborate with industrial partner.
* Motivated to develop teaching skills and coach students.
* Fluent in spoken and written English.

Naast redactie-analisten zijn er diverse centrale rollen in het team die jou bij je werk zullen ondersteunen.  

  

**Functieprofiel**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.


**VOORWAARDEN**


* salaris, passend bij jouw ervaring;
* 38-urige werkweek, minder uur in overleg;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;

Wij vinden privacy belangrijk! Als privacy officer heb je dan ook een belangrijke sleutelrol in het behadelen van diverse privacyvraagstukken van SamenTwente.

Ben jij op zoek naar een échte uitdaging? Die vind je bij ons!

En leuke collega’s. Alhoewel… Ronald en Aad beschieten elkaar nog wel eens met een Nerfgun, daar moet je wel tegen kunnen :-)

**SamenTwente: krachtenbundeling voor een gezond, veilig en vitaal Twente**

Eén SamenTwente van en voor onze 14 Twentse gemeenten. SamenTwente is een overkoepelende organisatie voor de organisaties GGD Twente, Veilig Thuis Twente (VTT) en Organisatie voor Zorg en Jeugdhulp in Twente (OZJT), en voor de coalities Twentse Koers, Samen14 en Kennispunt Twente. Samen met de 14 gemeenten en onze ketenpartners zetten we ons in voor een gezond, veilig en vitaal Twente.

**Wat ga je doen**

Als privacy officer kom je te werken in een unieke organisatie. Wij staan midden in de maatschappij en verwerken veel gevoelige persoonsgegevens.

Ons organisatieonderdeel GGD Twente speelt een centrale rol bij onder andere de bestrijding van infectieziekten zoals Corona en TBC, de gezondheid van opgroeiende kinderen en grootschalig dataonderzoek onder Twentse inwoners.

We zijn begonnen aan een ontdekkingsreis rondom privacy. Jij staat daarbij aan het roer en kan meebepalen. De ontwikkeling en de doorontwikkeling staan bij ons hoog in het vaandel en daarop gaan we de komende tijd inzetten. Dat maakt dat we zoekende zijn hóe we de ontwikkelingen aanvliegen. Wil jij met ons meedenken?

*Niet alles is dus geregeld. Zie jij daar kansen en mogelijkheden?*

Jij zorgt er voor dat het verwerkingenregister op orde is, dat data protection impact assessments (DPIA’s) worden uitgevoerd voor nieuwe en bestaande systemen en processen, waarbij mogelijk sprake is van verhoogde privacy risico’s. Daarnaast beantwoord je vraagstukken uit de organisatie en handel je datalekken af.

Kortom, je bent het privacy geweten van de directie, staat aan de basis van het werk en vindt het leuk om veel te schakelen. Je weet wat er leeft, bent actiegericht en jouw initiatief leidt tot verbetering. Je krijgt bij ons de ruimte om te laten zien wat je kan, en om je verder te ontwikkelen.

Je staat er niet alleen voor, want je werkt samen met je collega privacy officer, onze functionaris gegevensbescherming (FG) - die tevens ICT-jurist is -, onze informatieadviseurs en onze CISO.

Als afdeling zorgen we er voor dat onze mooie organisatie op een goede, veilige en prettige manier kan werken met informatiesystemen.

**Herken jij de uitdaging, maar twijfel je of je aan alle vereisten voldoet? Dan moedigen we je toch aan om te solliciteren.**

*In deze functie voor 36 uur per week krijg jij écht alle ruimte om zelf zaken te ontwikkelen.*

**Dit bieden wij jou**

* Een contract voor de periode van 1 jaar. Bevalt het van beide kanten goed dan volgt een contract voor onbepaalde tijd.
* Een bruto maandsalaris van maximaal € 5.247,- (schaal 10, cao SGO), op basis van een 36-urige werkweek. Afhankelijk van jouw opleiding, kennis en ervaring word je ingeschaald.

* We stimuleren groei en bieden je de mogelijkheid opleidingen en cursussen te volgen.
* Jouw standplaats is ons Twentehuis in Enschede, dat op loopafstand ligt van het Centraal Station.

**Jouw kwaliteiten**

Met jouw open, nieuwsgierige en proactieve houding ben je gericht op kwaliteitsverbetering, doelmatigheid en rechtmatigheid. Je hebt gevoel voor bestuurlijke verhoudingen en oog voor de belangen van de inwoner en de samenleving.

Jouw talent is, dat je een echte verbinder bent. Je begrijpt de verschillende belangen van een inwoner, een journalist, een arts, een manager of een bestuurder, en gaat op zoek naar de vraag achter de vraag. Je kan niet-juristen helder uitleggen welke keuzes en dilemma’s er zijn als het gaat om privacy in relatie tot de beoogde doelen van de organisatie.

Met jouw gestructureerde en zorgvuldige aanpak weet jij de nodige resultaten te behalen. Je volgt de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van privacy op de voet en adviseert collega’s, teammanagers en opdrachtgevers gevraagd en ongevraagd over dit onderwerp.

**Opleiding en ervaring van onze ideale kandidaat**

* Je hebt een hbo- werk- en denkniveau en een relevante opleiding afgerond.
* Je hebt ervaring in een soortgelijke functie in een grotere organisatie.
* Vanzelfsprekend ben je op de hoogte van de actuele wet- en regelgeving op het gebied van gegevensbescherming.

**Who Are We - About Job Squad‍️**
----------------------------------


Job Squad was founded by a couple of young Danish entrepreneurs with a passion for recruitment and HR. One has years of experience in corporate recruitment, the other is a startup obsessed with more than 4 of these young businesses to his name. Both of these young mavericks came together with their shared experiences to create Job Squad, a personal recruitment agency with a corporate twist. Job Squad’s vision was to create career opportunities for Europeans across borders, that will strengthen and develop their personality and career diversity. By breaking down borders and bringing on a wide variety of clients and positions we try to make sure there’s a position and dream destination for everyone.


At Job Squad we like to think of ourselves as professionals without the formality - after all, we are here to help and make sure both job hunt and relocation are as seamless and supportive as possible. Furthermore, we are a big multinational team, living and working in many different countries, but working closely both in and between teams! An internship at Job Squad means that you will become an essential part of the team, and you will have tasks and responsibilities and we expect you to be proactive.

Werkstress, ongewenst gedrag, thuiswerken en gevaarlijke stoffen. Zijn dat onderwerpen die jou raken? En denk je graag op strategisch niveau na over optimale inzet van online content om arboprofessinals te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk? Dan is de baan van hoofdredacteur Arbo mogelijk iets voor jou.

Er is nauwe samenwerking met de redacties, zo zitten we iedere donderdag samen op kantoor en wisselen we regelmatig kennis met elkaar uit.  

**Hybride werkvorm** – Minimaal 1 dag werken we in ons prachtige kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van de tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.  

**Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Arbo is sinds kort onder een compleet nieuw team met een nieuwe contentstrategie en er is veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën.  

**Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten van wie je kunt leren.

**Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring met uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een individueel keuze-budget dat je naar eigen inzicht kunt besteden en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten!
