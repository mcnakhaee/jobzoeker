ING is looking for an experienced IT Area Lead for the Modelling Area with a passion for Risk, Innovation and Delivery.
  

  

**Setting of the Modelling Area:**
  

  

The Modelling Area is responsible for the support of the different life cycles of Risk Models. The Risk Models implement regulatory required policies related to a.o. Probability of Default, Exposure At Default, Loss Given Default, IFRS9, Credit Risk Economic Capital.
  

  

**Important Model Life Cycle stages touching IT are:**
  

  

Data Collection, get the data which might be used in a model for good predictions. Model Development, creation of the model (nb the build of risk models is not IT development). Model Validation, independent internal check if the model is correct. Model Implementation, implement the model at production in executional form. Model Monitoring, before go live monitor predictions and real results. Model Periodic Validation, after go live monitor at regular interval predictions and real results.
  

  

Of these Model Life Cycle steps only Model Implementation is in scope of the Modelling Area, e.g. the engineers doing the implementation are in the Area. The other Model Life Cycle steps are executed by other departments (up to 1,000 FTE involved) while merely executed on IT platforms the Modelling Area supports.
  

  

**The bigger chunks of work from an engineering perspective:**
  

  

Support Modelling Exploration platforms Vortex Advanced Analytics (SAS 9.4) and ModelING Platform SAS VIYA 3.5. In Exploration the Model Life Cycle stages Data Collection, Model Development, Model Validation, Model Monitoring and Model Periodic Validation are supported. Both platforms will migrate to Model Platform SAS VIYA 4.0 on Azure. Support of Modelling Runtime platform will also be on SAS Viya 4.0. In Runtime the Model Life Cycle stage Model Implementation is supported.
  

  

Support Model Apps (models as independent applications) on our in-house built Python platform. Support SAS Visual Analytics as reporting tool on top of our core Credit Risk system.
  

  

There are 30 FTE in ING NL, 10 FTE in SSI India and 20 FTE in ING Poland.
  

  

It's an Area in the bigger Global Risk department.
  

  

**The challenges of the Modelling Area**
  

  

The Modelling Tribe and Area operate in a very challenging environment and act as critical part of a long End2End delivery chain. Key topics:
  

  

ING need to renew Basel III IRB models and the first new models on the new ModelING Platform are implemented in 2023. In a few years 26 different l need to be implemented. SAS VIYA 3.5 migration to MP SAS VIYA 4.0 on top of Azure. Once SAS VIYA 3.5 migration is completed the VAA SAS 9.4 migration to SAS VIYA 4.0 needs to happen.
  

  

**Profile**
  

  

The first key requirement is that we need an experienced manager at IT Area Lead level, e.g. it can be a second IT Area Lead position or there is a clear track record showing the required capabilities.
  

  

**On top of that the focus will be on:**

We are looking for a motivated postdoctoral researcher with an interest and expertise in building computational models of body representation, technological augmentation, and embodiment. The goal of the project is to uncover the neurocognitive principles underlying the embodiment of finger-extending exoskeletons. To what extent do internal representations of the body and technology (e.g. exoskeletal fingers) fuse into a single representation? To make headway on answering this fundamental question, we will use a variety of neuroscientific approaches (behaviour and M/EEG) and analytical tools (computational modelling, machine learning).
  
  

**You will be part of the NOW VIDI Grant ’Human 2.0:** A neurocognitive framework for upgrading the body’. As a postdoctoral researcher, you will design novel behavioural and neuroimaging paradigms (EEG) to measure internal representations of the body and tools (specifically, finger-extending exoskeletons), as well as their fusion. In this project, we endeavour to understand the fusion process at a neurocomputational level. You will apply Bayesian modelling to behavioural data to characterise the somatosensory and multisensory transformations underlying fusion. You will then use machine learning approaches to identify neural signatures of their implementation in EEG signals. The overall goal of these experiments is to gain a better understanding of the embodiment of technology at a computational and neural level. There will be close collaboration with other members of the team, including colleagues throughout the Donders Institute. Project management and mentoring (MSc and BSc) will also be part of your responsibilities.

***Passionate about the scientific analysis of Cultural Heritage? Join us in building the next generation X-ray instrument for art and archaeology!***


Job description


The most advanced X-ray based techniques are availble at synchrotron radiation sources, such as the ESRF in Grenoble or DESY in Hamburg. Access to these extremely bright sources is limited, and Dutch researchers are in a disadvantageous position as the Netherlands are not directly involved in any of these centres of research. The Smart\*Light project (https://interregvlaned.eu/en/smart-light-2-0/) aims to make advanced X-ray analysis techniques available in the Netherlands. Several institutes in The Netherlands (TU Delft, TU Eindhoven, DIFFER) and Flanders (UAntwerpen, UGent) collaborate to develop a compact instrument that comprises an intense and energy-tunable X-ray source, X-ray optics and detectors. The source is based on the Inverse Compton Effect, where visible laser light, scattered by a relativistic electron beam, is promoted into the X-ray range, yielding a brilliant, coherent X-ray beam with a narrow bandwidth.



Your main task will be to build and commission the experimental endstation of Smart\*light. This endstation is meant for a characterisation of the beam and proof of principle experiments with a focus on cultural heritage objects (art objects or archaeological objects). This involves testing different components in the laboratory with X-ray tubes, verify their integration into the control software, determine spectroscopic figures of merit, optimize the instrument and demonstrate its capabilities in the first experiments. Based on the early experiments you will be involved in the planning of future Smart\*Light upgrades, especially regarding optics and beam shaping.



This work will be done within the team of the Alfeld Lab at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering of the Delft University of Technology. The Department of Materials Science is a diverse institution, working in small laboratories, headed by independent PIs on a range of topics, including optimising steel microstructure, corrosion, recycling and the investigation of cultural heritage. The Alfeld Lab is working on the multi-modal investigation of cultural heritage, with a special focus on X-ray investigations and the development of new instruments and data evaluation approaches.



You will work with the PI of the group, M. Alfeld, on the Smart\*Light endstation in the lab in Delft and with the team of the TU/e on the installation of the endstation in Eindhoven. It is possible to supervise Master students during the project and to pursue independent research endavours related to spectroscopy and/or cultural heritage.


Requirements


* You have experience in the operation and configuration of X-ray instruments for spectrometry, diffraction, imaging or similar techniques.
* You need to have a PhD in science (preferrably physics or chemistry) or engineering (materials science).
* You can work independently in an interdisciplinary environment with multiple stakeholders.
* You have at least moderate programming skills in python or the readiness to acquire these during the project.
* You have a good command of the English language, as you will be working in an international environment, and preferably of Dutch.
* You do not need to have worked with cultural heritage before, but it is a definite bonus.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



From 1 September next, a salary increase of 3.7% applies due to a Collective Agreement amendment, followed by an additional 1% increase on 1 January 2025. In addition, most employees employed on 1 September 2024 will receive a one-off payment of €300 gross based on full-time employment.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

The Faculty of Science and the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) are looking for a:  

  

**Postdoc on Causal Machine Learning for Spatio-temporal Datasets**


The Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) is looking for an excellent Postdoc researcher (1.0 FTE) with a background in Computer Science (or a closely related field) to join a project focused on developing an advanced machine learning framework for spatio-temporal datasets. The position is for 4 years and is partially funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) through the Aspasia premium awarded to dr. Mitra Baratchi for her research on machine learning for spatio-temporal data. The successful applicant will be embedded in the Spatio-temporal data Analysis and Reasoning (STAR) and the Automated Design of Algorithms (ADA) research groups and collaborate with researchers at the Natural Computing (NACO) and the Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) Research Groups. Moreover, there are plenty of opportunities for interaction and collaboration with other groups at the institute and internationally.  

  

The research project is broadly focused on automated intervention design. An intervention is any external interference in an ongoing process that is performed to achieve a particular outcome. Being able to answer interventional questions automatically will help decision-makers solve complex challenges (i.e., reducing methane emissions or reducing the infection rate during a pandemic). Most machine learning algorithms designed for spatio-temporal data do not allow assessing the impact of interventions without capturing causal links. At the same time, configuring causal machine learning algorithms is extremely difficult, being an unsupervised learning task. In this project, we aim to design algorithmic solutions (e.g., new Automated Machine Learning approaches) for automatic and scalable assessment of interventions based on observational spatio-temporal datasets generated by modern sensing technologies (e.g., IoT sensors, mobile devices, Earth observations).

 **Key Responsibilities**


Within this position, it is expected that you will:

Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips. This is made possible because Netflix UI is a thriving learning machine where Artwork & Video assets are personalized via reinforcement learning.

The strength of TU/e’s IT landscape is their key to success and, hence, so are you as being an essential contributor to that landscape. These creative minds expect you to offer them a solution for tomorrow that doesn’t exist today. Together we are building the high performance backbone that this epicenter of science and technology demands. Are you driven by taking ownership and do you have an entrepreneurial mindset? We like to get in touch with you!  

  

**About Library and Information Services (LIS)**  

The service department Library and Information Services (LIS) service is responsible for the entire demand - supply chain in the fields of information management, IT and library services. In consultation with stakeholders, requirements are collected, prioritized and aligned. The service department consists of six Product Areas: Library and Open Science, Research, Education, Corporate, Data & Insights and Platforms. Product Area Research is looking to strengthen their Research IT team with a consultant for the department Mathematics and computer science.  

  

**About the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science**  

With over 110 (assistant, associate and full) professors, almost 300 PhD and EngD students, about 1500 Bachelor students and 1000 Master students, the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) is the largest department of the TU/e. By performing top-level fundamental and applied research, and maintaining strong ties with industry, M&CS aims to contribute to science and innovation in and beyond the region.  

The department’s relationship with the high-tech industry in the Brainport region means that interested staff and students can contribute directly to the development of technological innovations with real-world relevance. Several successful spin-offs have originated from the department and our staff participates in many national and international research consortia.  

  

**The postion**  

As a research IT consultant, you work in collaboration with researchers to develop fit-for-purpose, sustainable IT solutions. In addition, you provide (proactive) advice on how to translate functional IT requirements to technical products, services and workflows. You work in proximity of the department and its IT landscape, and have a pioneering role in setting up innovative (specific) solutions. You are part of a multidisciplinary team in which you share and learn from each other’s knowledge and expertise. This enables you to facilitate researchers at TU/e in conducting their research. You work for a department which fosters multidisciplinary research requiring highly specialized computational methods. With your broad range of interests and ability to oversee the complex landscape of interests and challenges, you facilitate the needs of research, so that scientists can focus on their most innovative work. You will also have the opportunity to build up an extensive network and to specialize in relevant research areas.


How this looks like in practice? Read the following section:  

  

**A typical week of a Research IT consultant at M&CS:**  

On Monday, you start the week together with the departmental IT support unit (“The Hub”) and review the current developments and your activities at M&CS. Together, you align on priorities and determine tactics for the best approach. In the afternoon, you visit a researcher who wants to scale up their computational jobs, by parallelizing the script to compute efficiently on the available resources. You advise them on what resources could be suitable for this use case and optionally get them in contact with expert support on this topic. At the same time, you notice you receive this type of question quite often, so you coordinate with the back-office to make sure we can support this type of request long-term.


On Tuesday, you work out a plan to facilitate in the IT requirements for a new Computer Science lab at the department, in alignment with the TU/e policies and frameworks for deploying IT. As development of this lab


might be interesting for the whole department, you prepare an agenda item for the department's IT committee. As you work in the same room with your fellow consultants in the afternoon, you can easily count on their help on how to approach this.


On Wednesday, you work at home and focus on developing and testing an IDE platform for specific applications that are needed for the Machine Learning group. You maintain a close feedback loop with the users and make agreements on structural support of the prototype. You inform your colleagues as they might also be interested in such a platform for their customers.


On Thursday, you meet the board during your regular check-in moment to report on the progress of their ‘research IT’. You have prepared in advance by checking in with the users and their experience and by analyzing available user data. For instance, you know that their VM facility is running out of capacity, so you advise them in policy-making to distribute the resources more efficiently. In the afternoon, you have a strategic meeting with your fellow consultants on how you want to develop as a team and the services you're offering.


On Friday, you took a seminar in the morning to spike up your research data management knowledge, and this comes in handy as you received a request to consult on a data management workflow for a research group using Git and other storage platforms. You have a call with the Data Steward to work out the details and you contribute to the technical aspects of the workflow.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* You have a minimum education of a Master’s degree or PhD degree, preferably with a background in Computer Science, Data Science or any related field;
* Several years of experience with conducting research, and you are able to effectively communicate with scientific staff;
* You are organizationally sensitive; you initiate and maintain relevant relationships with customers, (key) user groups, and suppliers;
* You identify the wishes and needs of our researchers, to proactively provide fit-for-purpose, IT solutions, and at the same time make proposals for sustainable innovation implementation based on demand trends;
* You are a pleasant collaboration partner for both scientists and the IT back office, thereby mediating between organization and innovation;
* You initiate action to innovate existing products and services, based on the interest of the department you represent;
* You have experience with one or more of the following techniques: Remote computing (cloud and / or on premise), Research Data Management and processing, Software Engineering, Git and / or code repository management, Software Licensing, AI related topics, Internet of Things, Infrastructural Architecture;
* Experience with scripting and automating workflows, in particular in Linux OS, is a bonus.


If you are concerned that you don’t meet all the requirements sufficiently, but the job does excite you, then be sure to respond, we would love to look at your profile.


**Conditions of employment**

How does the medieval body of texts known as 'canon law' reflect social and moral ideas? With a combination of AI and an advanced dataset, can we reveal patterns in the transmission and alteration of these ideas over time? Join the SOLEMNE project as a research assistant to explore these questions and more.
  
  

The medieval body of texts known as 'canon law' not only regulates strictly religious or ecclesiastical issues but also communicates social and moral ideas about the inner life of society. With an advanced dataset and novel AI techniques, it is possible to chart how such ideas are transmitted, appropriated, altered, and promoted in canonical collections. As a research assistant you will contribute to this study by expanding its data entry and training AI models.
  
  

This one-year position is part of the project 'The Social Life of Early Medieval Normative Texts' (SOLEMNE), funded through an ERC Consolidator Grant awarded to Dr Sven Meeder. A fuller description of the project can be found here. The SOLEMNE project aims to describe and contextualise the spread of social norms as articulated through specific combinations of canons in a bottom-up approach starting from the vast corpus of manuscript witnesses of canonical collections in every shape and form (4th-12th centuries). A dynamic dataset forms an essential element of the project, combined with an innovative digital tool that allows for queries of shared content in canonical collections or manuscripts and of levels of affinity based on combinations of authoritative statements.
  
  

In close collaboration with the project's postdoctoral researcher, associated data scientists, and development team, you will (i) contribute to the design of the database to store the information regarding original medieval manuscripts preserving individual canons and entire canonical collections, and scholarly editions of these texts, (ii) play a key role in training handwritten text recognition (HTR) models using eScriptorium software as well as AI-driven models for correction and normalisation of the transcription, (iii) populate the database with the data gathered from the original documents and printed reference works, (iv) contribute to the wider communication of the project's results, including materials intended for a general audience, and (v) cooperate closely with all of SOLEMNE’s subprojects.

**The challenge**


Eindhoven University of Technology's Industrial Design department developed and implemented Data Foundry, a platform to address these challenges. Data Foundry enables the collection and management of data from remote devices in real-time and supports qualitative data collection, participant management, and data visualization. Data Foundry is also increasingly used to prototype in design using data, server-side scripting and AI. Despite successfully supporting over 2000 design projects, Data Foundry is currently limited to Eindhoven University of Technology due privacy and data sharing protocols. We want to change that and use Data Foundry in collaborative contexts and make Data Foundry available to others design institutions.


This is why we will **open-source Data Foundry** and we need your help for that. The project 'ODeDaI' aims to enhance Data Foundry's configurability and extend its documentation, allowing seamless integration with other universities and institutions. This will enable broader adoption of the platform, ensuring compliance with diverse data sharing policies and promoting open science practices within the design community and beyond. By making Data Foundry adaptable for various institutions and policies, we intend to foster greater collaboration amongst researchers, educational institutions, and industry professionals, both nationally and internationally.

* You will be surrounded by a team of fellow EngDs and PhDs that focus on data-enabled design and more generally new tools and infrastructures for Industrial Design.


**The EngD position**


As a designer and creative technologist you dive deep into understanding the needs and workflows of data x design, both in education and research practice. You work with the Data Foundry infrastructure and prepare it inside-out for an open-source release in 2025. You work as part of the Data Foundry team and realize ideas for new features, documentation and helpful education materials. You build and work with growing community to collect user feedback, early and often.


Requirements


* A Masters degree in an industrial design or creative software development related discipline (e.g., Industrial Design with technical focus, Computer Science or Software Engineering with design affinity). Masters degree needs to be obtained before the prospective starting date of this position: September/ October 2024.


Design creation skills


* Proficient with full-stack integration of different software libraries and adapting them to your needs to build great user experiences (e.g., output of AI algorithms, managing local development environments)
* Knowledge of software designing and architecture, different architectural patterns, data modelling.
* Interest in and understanding of AI, data visualization
* Eye for detail and quality
* Experience with writing technical documentation is a plus.


Soft skills


* Strong collaborator with multi-disciplinary team members and academic design education stakeholders

-------------------


The Department of Industrial Design of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), in cooperation with Philips Clinical Informatics is offering two fully funded 2-year positions to master graduates leading to the award of an EngD (Engineering Doctorate) degree in Designing Human-System Interaction.


**Societal urgency**


Access to high quality healthcare is under increasing pressure. Patient volumes are rising due to an aging population, and the amount of data from scans and image interpretation is increasing at a steeper pace than radiologists and pathologists can handle. Radiology leaders have raised alarm that labor shortages are leading to longer wait times and delays in treatment for patients. Never has there been a bigger need to relieve the pressure from staff. But how exactly do we make that happen?


**The challenge**


Adoption of radiology and pathology solutions is increasingly driven by the extent to which solutions “naturally” fit into clinical workflows and enable radiologists and pathologists to deliver quality at speed. This requires not only high-quality medical data and cutting-edge AI models. More so, clinical acceptance and adoption depends on solutions that are designed with a clear understanding of clinical workflows and usage patterns, and with the requirements that different clinical experts have on their tooling. Beyond functional requirements, successful clinical adoption needs highly intuitive solutions, seamless workflow integration (speed), and a great user experience. In sum, we face the overarching challenge of how to integrate AI-based clinical decision-making tools into clinical practice that is characterized by fast-paced, high-stakes decision-making informed by deep domain knowledge and year-long expertise.


Prototypes that are highly realistic in the eyes of the clinical user have shown to be an important “vehicle” to enable rapid co-creation with clinicians. It enables them to give meaningful clinician-centered direction to development complex technical tools. Are you ready to iteratively create such prototypes and shape them together with experts in the field?


**You are part of a learning community**


You will be strongly embedded in and work closely with a highly dynamic community with experts from different disciplines including designers, researchers, engineers, clinical specialists and business:


* You will work “in-tandem” with your fellow EngD team member. You learn from each other by bouncing-off ideas and taking turns at different steps in the design process.
* You will immerse yourself in the Philips Clinical Informatics business context working closely with the design teams on the latest technology developments in radiology and digital pathology, in close collaboration with hospitals and clinical end-users where the impact is made.
* The EngD program offers a personalized learning experience through a mix of courses, coaching and hands-on learning by doing.
* You will be surrounded by a team of fellow EngDs and PhDs that focus on human-AI collaboration in the healthcare domain.


**The two positions**


**EngD position 1 – The medical data visualization & AI designer**


In this position you dive deep into understanding the needs and workflows of the clinical end users and translate those insights into design concepts and interactive data visualizations. You express your ideas by creating clickable demonstrators together with your buddy “the creative technologist” (the second EngD candidate) and you enjoy using your user research skills to set up interviews and simulated use tests to collect user feedback, early and often.


Requirements


* A Masters degree in an industrial design related discipline (e.g., Industrial Design, Interaction Design, UX-UI, HCI). Masters degree needs to be obtained before the prospective starting date of this position: September/ October 2024.


Design creation skills


* Strong conceptual design skills (translating user insights into concepts pushing the boundaries of the status quo)
* Affinity with UI, visual design skills, wireframes and clickable prototypes (e.g., Figma)
* Data visualization (next gen medical data & AI visualization)
* Interest in and understanding of AI (i.e., integration of AI in user journeys)
* Eye for detail and quality


Design research skills


* Enjoy experimentation with iterations based on user feedback and contextual insights
* Intermediate knowledge of user research methods (e.g., interviews, setting up and running small hands-on user tests with clinical end users, inquiries with stakeholders)


Soft skills


* Strong collaborator with multi-disciplinary team members and industry stakeholders
* Curious to know more about the healthcare domain and in obtaining a deep understanding of clinical end users in their daily work
* Can-do attitude and hands-on designer


**EngD position 2 – The creative technologist**


In this position you use your front-end software prototyping powers to create dynamic and realistic clinical workflow prototypes with clinical data, medical data visualizations and interactive AI outputs. You work closely with your buddy, the “medical data visualization & AI designer” where you take the lead in interactive prototype implementation to create a realistic clinical user experience based on actual data and AI outputs.


Requirements


* A Masters degree in an industrial design or creative software development related discipline (e.g., Industrial Design with technical focus, Computer Science or Software Engineering with design affinity). Masters degree needs to be obtained before the prospective starting date of this position: September/ October 2024.


Technical skills


* Solid front-end software prototyping development skills with modern web technologies and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, data visualization tools and libraries)
* Proficient with full-stack integration of different software libraries and adapting them to your needs to build great user experiences (e.g., output of AI algorithms, managing local development environments)

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

-------------------


In the Geometric Learning and Differential Geometry Group (GLDG) within the Centre for Analysis, Scientific Computing and Applications (CASA) we invent, apply, and build new theory and methods in geometric AI for automated medical and industrial image analysis. The Geometric Deep learning methods developed in GLDG bridge the gap in image processing between machine learning and traditional PDE/geometry-based methods.


The focus in the group GLDG supported by VICI project “Geometric Learning for Image Analysis” (R. Duits) is on PDE-based equivariant neural networks aiming for impact on industry and society. This requires close interplay between mathematical theory and practical requirements. With implementation running parallel to theoretical development, we ensure that our geometric learning is both well-founded in profound new mathematics and relevant for practical applications.


Key objectives of the position are:


* Develop high-performance implementations of geometric learning methods for modern hardware whileconnecting advanced scientific computing to applied and geometric analysis.
* Establish connections to industryvia joint projects ongeometric learning and image processing**,** while investing in in-house implementations to keep our research relevant for industry.
* Target and steer the direction of the theory by available hardware and performance. Advanced geometrical, topological theory and algorithms need to be developed.
* Be active in funding acquisition and set up a clear, personal, and visible research line that fits the overall activities and strategy in the GLDG group and CASA cluster.
* Open the black box of deep learning via geometric interpretability and explainable AI. Promising results are growing and allow for clear analysis by experts, but intuitive visualization and interpretation tools to industrial/health tech partners raise challenges to be tackled.

-------------------


  
Stel je voor: een dynamische rol waarin je direct bijdraagt aan veiligheid, vertrouwen en duurzaamheid in transport, infrastructuur, milieu en wonen. Wij zijn op zoek naar een enthousiaste en gedreven adviseur datakwaliteit voor ons Datakwaliteitscentrum (DKC). Bij de Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT) speel jij een cruciale rol in het waarborgen van hoogwaardige datakwaliteit.



In deze uitdagende functie werk je nauw samen met ons team om de datakwaliteit in onze processen te verbeteren en te verankeren. Het DKC bevindt zich in een interessante fase van ontwikkeling en jij krijgt de kans om hieraan bij te dragen en je stempel te drukken!



Hoe jij bijdraagt in je rol



Voor een optimale informatiepositie is goede datakwaliteit essentieel. Jij speelt hierin een sleutelrol. Door grondige analyses van de datakwaliteit bepaal je samen met de business de prioriteiten en bedenk je innovatieve oplossingen. Je begeleidt en adviseert gebruikers bij het opstellen van datakwaliteitseisen, je voert gedetailleerde kwaliteitsanalyses uit en communiceert bevindingen helder met concrete verbeteradviezen. Zo ondersteun je collega’s om de datakwaliteit aanzienlijk te verbeteren. Waar nodig vertaal je deze adviezen naar functionele user stories voor ontwikkelaars.



Het DKC is volop in ontwikkeling. Samen met 3 collega’s speel je een cruciale rol in het standaardiseren van processen om de datakwaliteit binnen de ILT te verbeteren en te waarborgen. Binnen het team deel je wat je in de business tegenkomt en geef je constructieve feedback over interne standaarden en processen, zodat het DKC continu verbetert.



Als adviseur datakwaliteit maak je deel uit van team Data. Dit team is verantwoordelijk voor de realisatie van informatieproducten en functionaliteiten die informatiegestuurd werken ondersteunen. De ILT werkt met zowel intern gecreëerde data, zoals vergunninggegevens en inspectierapporten, als met extern opgevraagde data, zoals KvK-gegevens en specifieke datasets. In jouw rol schakel je effectief met verschillende partners, zoals gebruikers en producenten van data, binnen het team en de organisatie.



Dit is waar jij voldoening uit haalt



Jij geniet van een dynamische functie waarin je samenwerkt met diverse stakeholders uit verschillende disciplines. Je wilt écht begrijpen wat de gebruiker van data nodig heeft. Je haalt voldoening uit het aanpakken van uitdagende vraagstukken en het vertalen van gebruikersbehoeften in concrete betekenis voor de datakwaliteit, wat bijdraagt aan de verbetering van de maatschappelijke impact van onze organisatie. Je waardeert de mogelijkheid om oplossingen te bedenken en hierover te adviseren en je voelt je gemotiveerd door de concrete resultaten die voortkomen uit jouw werk. Daarnaast werk je makkelijk met collega’s samen en wissel je graag kennis en expertise met hen uit.



Meer weten?



We kunnen ons voorstellen dat je meer wilt weten over deze functie. Je kunt daarom altijd vrijblijvend contact opnemen met Margot van Dorst, teamleider van Team Data, via 06-52401165. Zij staat jou graag te woord! Je kunt natuurlijk ook een kijkje nemen op onze website.

Je herkent je in de volgende eigenschappen:-



Wij waarderen jouw scherpe oog voor detail, je vermogen om kritische vragen te stellen en je onderzoekende instelling waarmee je snel informatie oppikt. Met deze vaardigheden en je vermogen om uitdagingen vanuit verschillende perspectieven te benaderen, kun je complexe problemen analyseren en effectieve oplossingen aandragen.



Je bent ondernemend, initiatiefrijk en hebt een hands-on mentaliteit. Jouw oplossingsgerichte benadering draagt continu bij aan het verbeteren van de datakwaliteit en de processen in de dataketen. Je communiceert graag over je zienswijzen, oplossingen en resultaten. Je werkt soepel samen met verschillende niveaus binnen onze organisatie, omdat je je verhaal aan hen kunt aanpassen. Hierdoor overtuig je zowel inspecteurs als afdelingshoofden van jouw oplossing. Dankzij jouw bijdrage versterken we onze informatiepositie, verbeteren we onze datagedreven besluitvorming en optimaliseren we onze dienstverlening aan de samenleving.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



Voor het optimale verloop van de processen binnen de Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT) is het essentieel dat wij over de juiste informatie beschikken. De afdeling Data en Analyse ziet hier op toe. Onze afdeling bestaat uit 5 teams: de teams Analyse 1 en 2, het team Data, het team Informatie-Programmering, en het team Inspectieview.



Team Data



De eerste stap in de keten zetten de dataspecialisten van team Data. Zij zorgen voor het binnenhalen van de benodigde gegevens. De data zijn veelal afkomstig van andere overheidsorganisaties, commerciële partijen en bestaande ILT-systemen. De ruwe data worden omgezet in gevalideerde en gestructureerde gegevens met de afgesproken kwaliteit. De gegevens zijn nu toegankelijk voor data-analisten. Team Data zorgt op haar beurt ook voor het leveren van ILT-data aan andere organisaties.



**Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport**
---------------------------------------



De Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT) is de toezichthouder van het ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat. Met 1.600 medewerkers zet de ILT zich dagelijks in voor een duurzame en veilige leefomgeving, veilig transport en het vertrouwen in publieke instellingen zoals woningcorporaties.



De ILT ziet erop toe dat zeer uiteenlopende doelgroepen een breed scala van wetten en regels naleven. Het aandachtsgebied van de ILT omvat ongeveer 160 onderwerpen waaronder geluidsoverlast in de luchtvaart, vaartijden in de binnenvaart, taxivergunningen, woningcorporaties, vervoer van gevaarlijke stoffen, afval, genetisch gemodificeerde organismen en energielabels van woningen.



We bewegen mee met maatschappelijke en technologische ontwikkelingen en zetten onze middelen in daar waar de risico’s voor de publieke belangen het grootst zijn. Een goed gebruik van data en andere informatie is sturend voor al onze werkzaamheden: van toezicht en vergunning- en dienstverlening tot opsporing en communicatie.



Samenwerken, leren door doen en constant verbeteren zijn onze sleutelwoorden. Medewerkers, leidinggevenden en teams krijgen de ruimte om talenten optimaal in te zetten, bevlogenheid te tonen en het verschil te maken. Welke eigenschappen wij zoeken in nieuwe medewerkers? De vaardigheid om te kunnen werken met diverse informatiebronnen, out-of-the-box kunnen denken bij toezichtsvraagstukken, de creativiteit hebben om vernieuwende methodes te bedenken en in te zetten, met lef onbekende paden durven bewandelen en overzicht kunnen houden.



Je bent welkom zoals je bent  

De Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport hecht grote waarde aan diversiteit. Verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en inzichten vergroten de denkkracht en handelingsperspectieven van een team. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent en van wie je houdt. We zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou.

Als junior onderzoeker Publieke Gezondheid draag je jouw steentje bij aan een stad waar de inwoners gezond en veerkrachtig zijn. Je werkt mee aan de monitoring van de gezondheid van de inwoners en het beschikbaar maken van de informatie en kennis voor praktijk en beleid. Dit doe je in nauwe samenwerking met je collega onderzoekers publieke gezondheid, gezondheidsexperts en beleidsadviseurs. De beleidsnota Gezondheid - Samen gezondheidsverschillen verkleinen 2024 - 2027 is ons beleidskader voor het werken aan gezond stedelijk leven voor iedereen.


**Dit is je werk**
------------------


Utrecht is de stad van gezond stedelijk leven voor iedereen. Veel beleid in de gemeente heeft impact op gezondheid van de inwoners. Aan de basis van dit beleid liggen data en kennis. Onderzoekers Publieke Gezondheid monitoren hoe het met de gezondheid van de inwoners gaat en welke factoren deze gezondheid beïnvloeden. In Utrecht komt deze kennis samen in de Volksgezondheidsmonitor Utrecht (VMU). Iedere vier jaar maken we de balans op in het Utrechts Gezondheidsprofiel (UGP). Onze werkwijze is om cijfermatige informatie te combineren met ervaringen en beelden van inwoners en professionals in de stad. De VMU komt tot stand door een team van onderzoekers die in samenwerking met andere gemeentelijke collega’s, stedelijke partners en kennispartners, aan gezondheidsthema’s werken. Ter versterking van het team zoeken wij een Junior Onderzoeker Publieke Gezondheid. Je ondersteunt bij ons onderzoek en werkt actief mee aan de uitvoering van de VMU, in het bijzonder aan:


* uitvoering van werkzaamheden rondom de Jeugdmonitor: opstellen van de vragenlijst, werven van scholen, inplannen van de afnames, coördineren van veldwerkers en ondersteunen bij de analyse en rapportage.
* uitvoering van werkzaamheden op de thema’s leefgewoonten en sociale omgeving: literatuur bijhouden, data analyseren, resultaten beschrijven voor de VMU-website.
* open data en dashboards bouwen (zie bijvoorbeeld Utrecht in Cijfers | Gemeente Utrecht - Nieuw en Eerste 1000 dagen van kinderen - Utrecht (incijfers.nl)
* Ondersteuning bij verdiepend kwantitatief en kwalitatief onderzoek.
* Meewerken aan plaatsen van teksten op de website en maken van infographics.


Onderzoeker zijn bij een gemeente is anders dan bij een universiteit of kennisinstituut. De duiding van de cijfers in een lokale context, met professionals en inwoners is een belangrijk onderdeel van ons werk. Dat betekent dat je de lokale, regionale, politiek-bestuurlijke en maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen en vraagstukken in je onderzoek betrekt.


**Dit is je werkplek**
----------------------


De gemeente Utrecht biedt ruimte aan iedereen. We zien talent als basis en diversiteit als kracht om samen betere resultaten te behalen. Voor jou is er plek bij de afdeling Volksgezondheid (VG). VG bestaat uit een aantal uitvoerende teams zoals de Jeugdgezondheidszorg (JGZ), het team zorg voor Volwassenen in een kwetsbare positie, het team van gezondheidsbevorderaars die actief zijn in de wijken (Co-creatie en Wijken, CCW) en Beleid en Onderzoek (BEO). Binnen dit laatste team zoeken we een junior onderzoeker. BEO bestaat uit ruim 30 mensen. Zij signaleren, monitoren, onderzoeken en agenderen relevante ontwikkelingen op het gebied van de volksgezondheid in Utrecht. Het vastgestelde volksgezondheidsbeleid vormt het bestuurlijk – politieke kader voor de uitvoering van hun werk. We werken aan het versterken van onze kennisrol. Binnen BEO werk je in het subteam Onderzoek. Dit bestaat uit ruim 10 collega’s en werkt als een zelf organiserend team. Vanuit deze basis werk je ook nauw samen met collega’s die vanuit beleid en praktijk betrokken zijn bij de volksgezondheid in de stad.

Ernstig letsel voorkomen is beter dan genezen. VeiligheidNL (het kenniscentrum letselpreventie) is daar iedere dag mee bezig. Wij zetten ons in om het leven van mensen veilig(er) te maken en stimuleren samen met onze partners veilig gedrag en een veilige leefomgeving, zodat de kans op ernstig letsel in alle fasen van een mensenleven verkleind wordt. Dit doen we binnen zes letselpreventiethema’s. We zijn aanwezig in alle fasen van een mensenleven vanaf de geboorte met het letselpreventiethema kinderveiligheid tot en met de laatste fase in een leven met het thema valpreventie bij ouderen. We zijn ook actief door het leven heen om gehoorschade door hard geluid terug te dringen, zetten stevig in op het terugdringen van sportblessures en dragen bij aan de verkeersveiligheid en veilig productgebruik in Nederland.

Vanuit ons kantoor in Amsterdam werken we met een team van ruim 70 collega’s samen met overheidsinstellingen en private organisaties. Wij zijn trots op onze open en professionele cultuur en we strijden voor maximale impact.

Wij maken van Albert Heijn het beste omnichannel Food & Tech bedrijf en willen digitaal gemak voor iedereen. We testen en experimenteren, zijn innovatief en verleggen grenzen. Voor die reis hebben wij het Data Talent Track. Een track waarin wij jouw carrière als Data Analyst bij Albert Heijn een vliegende start geven binnen onze Digital Analytics afdeling. Is dit echt iets voor jou? Word dan de nieuwe Data Analyst in ons Data Talent Track!

  

  

**Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst ken jij onze klant het beste. Deze kennis verkrijg je door gebruik te maken van data (zoals bijvoorbeeld data over koopgedrag), om zo de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van data-oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk met de nieuwste data analytics technieken. Je maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Analytics & Data Science team, en bent daarmee onderdeel van de grotere Analytics community binnen Albert Heijn. Je beweegt makkelijk tussen Tech, Data Science en de business teams, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data analytics toepassingen. Je maakt impact als Data Analist door:

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

  



**Dit doe je als Data Analyst Digital**

Het Digital domein richt zich op digitale relevantie, experimentation, eCommerce en klantloyaliteit. Hiervoor voeren we data-analyses uit of ontwikkelen wij dataproducten om onze e-commerce en Digital-afdelingen te ondersteunen met inzichten rondom onze klanten, het verbeteren van e-commerce en het verbeteren van de customer journey. Denk daarbij aan projecten zoals het relevanter maken van onze aanbiedingen (Mijn Bonus Box) of marketing, inzichtelijk maken van de omnichannel customer journeys en het analyseren van onze spaarprogramma’s.

  



**Jouw ontwikkeling in het Data Talent Track**


Het Data Talent Track is een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen die je helpen om jouw professionele vaardigheden te ontwikkelen.

 **De beste ingrediënten voor een betekenisvolle baan**

* Een salaris van max € 4000,- per periode van 4 weken (afhankelijk van je ervaring)

**Jouw impact bij Movares**
---------------------------


* Je zorgt ervoor dat de communicatie tussen beveiligingsinstallatie en treindienstleiders goed functioneert. Waarbij telecom is gericht op communicatie tussen treinen en computersystemen en GSM-R op draadloze communicatie tussen treinen en communicatiemasten (UMTS).
* Jij past het communicatienetwerk in de relaishuizen aan. Dat is een wijziging van hardware en software. Deze werkzaamheden worden 's nachts op locatie gedaan;
* Je werkt op projectbasis, adviseert de opdrachtgever, specificeert de product- en materiaaleisen en draagt bij aan het opstellen van offertes.

Je onderhoudt voortdurend contact met relevante partijen om problemen op te lossen en de kwaliteit te waarborgen. Je maakt dus ook gebruik van GSM-R, een geo-informatiesysteem dat veilige communicatie tussen treindienstleiders en machinisten garandeert. Dit systeem definieert een geografisch gebied met zendmasten. Wanneer er wijzigingen zijn aan het spoor, pas je datasheets aan om ervoor te zorgen dat de locatie van de trein correct is gekoppeld aan de juiste GSM-R locatie. Onze afdeling bij Loxia bestaat uit zo’n 30 collega’s die zelfstandig projecten uitvoeren. We zijn een hecht team en lossen samen complexe vraagstukken op. Ons team heeft een hoog verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel want zonder ons rijden er geen treinen. Onze werkzaamheden zijn uniek en complex, daarom is er een opleidingstraject van ruim een jaar, waarin je samen met je mentor het ontwerpproces leert.
**Dit ga je doen bij Movares**
------------------------------


Naast skills in het telecom domein heb je ook communicatieve vaardigheden voor een goede samenwerking met alle betrokken partijen. Je durft regie te nemen en neemt initiatief om werkzaamheden in goede banen te laten lopen. Je bent ongeveer 15 nachten per jaar in het weekend aan het werk bij relaishuizen langs het spoor. Daarom ben je ook in het bezit van een rijbewijs. Alles zoals een auto, hotelovernachtingen en vergoedingen worden geregeld vanuit Movares. **Dit breng je ook mee:**
* afgeronde HBO-opleiding of aantoonbaar MBO+ niveau (elektronica);
* kennis van het telecom domein;
* kennis van treinbeveiliging en/of kennis van ArcGis is een pre.

Jouw ontwikkeling bij Movares Jouw talent en (vakinhoudelijke) kennis benutten én verder ontwikkelen vinden we belangrijk. Dat doen we in talentprogramma’s met intervisiegroepen en tijdens kennissessies door ervaren collega’s. Ook hebben we een eigen Academy met ruim 3.000 verschillende leerlijnen, trainingen en e-learningmodules. In iedere fase van je loopbaan dagen we je uit om jezelf steeds te blijven ontwikkelen. Daar groeien we samen van.
**Dit krijg je bij Movares**
----------------------------


Bij Movares werk je aan projecten met een grote maatschappelijke impact. Daar krijg je iets voor terug dat niet in geld uit te drukken is: voldoening. En natuurlijk zijn onze primaire en secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden uitstekend. We zetten ze voor je op een rijtje:

Creativiteit  

**De afdeling -** ***Directie Grote Ondernemingen***  

De Directie Grote Ondernemingen (GO) is verantwoordelijk voor de fiscale behandeling van de ongeveer 9.000 grootste ondernemingen en non-profit organisaties in Nederland. Daarnaast behandelt GO een aantal dossiers van zeer vermogende personen en voeren we een aantal zeer uiteenlopende specialistische taken uit zoals de kansspelbelasting en constructiebestrijding. Onze klanten vertegenwoordigen zo’n 75% van de belastinginkomsten van de rijksoverheid. Ook genereren zij veel informatie die de overheid gebruikt voor bijvoorbeeld toeslagen of studiefinanciering.


De uitvoerings- en toezichtstrategie van GO is gericht op bereidwillige naleving van wet- en regelgeving door deze organisaties. Zij kenmerken zich door relatief grote financiële belangen en complexere fiscale vraagstukken. In het geval van multinationals komt daar nog een component bij in de vorm van internationale wet- en regelgeving en samenwerking met buitenlandse belastingdiensten.


Om er voor te zorgen dat de belastingafdracht van deze organisaties soepel blijft lopen werkt GO met behandelteams. In deze teams wordt kennis over de specifieke branche, de individuele ondernemingen en kennis van de verschillende belastingmiddelen samengebracht.


Zo werkt GO aan een zo efficiënt en effectief mogelijk proces voor het heffen, controleren en innen van de belastingen bij de grootste ondernemingen en non profit organisaties en zo dragen we bij aan een financieel gezond Nederland.

 **De organisatie**  

Belastingdienst  

Bij de Belastingdienst werken ongeveer 25.000 mensen verspreid over het hele land aan een financieel gezond Nederland. Dit doen we door eerlijk en zorgvuldig belastingen en premies volksverzekeringen te heffen, te innen en te controleren en fraude op te sporen. De Belastingdienst maakt het burgers en bedrijven zo gemakkelijk mogelijk om verplichtingen na te kunnen komen en gebruik te kunnen maken van rechten. Dat gebeurt met passende dienstverlening, door massale processen juist en tijdig uit te voeren én door adequaat toezicht uit te oefenen.

The Aegean Sea is one of the most important marine biodiversity hotspots in the Mediterranean, with some of the most extensive and pristine seagrass meadows and coralligenous assemblages hosting populations of keystone species. Unfortunately, these biodiversity hotspots and keystone species are at increasing risk of anthropogenic activities such as illegal fishing, tourism and climate change. Archipelagos aims to protect and conserve the Aegean nature with frontier science for conservation, and we need spatial analyses in achieving our goals.

### **GIS-team**


Accurate maps depicting the location of protected habitats is key for the effective management and conservation of biodiversity hotspots. Unfortunately, the lack of accurate mapping in this region limits the extent of conservation action that can be implemented and enforced. The Archipelagos GIS team assists in collecting, interpreting, and visualizing data in all marine projects with the support from our research vessel the ‘Aegean Explorer’, scientific-equipped kayaks and satellite data. Main data sources for the GIS team are collected from an array of important scientific tools, such as a down-scan sonar, multibeam, biomass scanner, ROV and many more. We are involved in many national and international projects to improve the spatial data for the Mediterranean Sea.

### **Examples of recent internship projects**

* Collaborating in collecting, interpreting, and visualizing spatial data, with use of our research vessels, scientific-equipped kayaks and satellite data.
* Producing maps and reports to support conservation purposes.
* Assessing the distribution and density of seagrass meadows in the coastal zones around the Aegean Sea. Research is focused on remote sensing combined with training data obtained from downscan sonar kayak surveys.
* Developing and conducting rapid-assessment mapping techniques, combining citizen science, mulitbeam sonar, biomass scanner and ROV data. These advanced technologies offer valuable insight into coralligenous and other mesobenthic habitats’ presence, resulting in high-resolution distribution maps.
* Using wide range spatial data to map priority for improved management. For example, fishing data, boat traffic and Sentinel satellite imagery.
### **Your role**


The internship will consist of both fieldwork at sea and office work, which will help you to gain a valuable skill set in data collection and analyses from an array of scientific tools. You are providing support to different projects related to the conservation of the Aegean Sea and her islands. As Archipelagos is continually improving the data collection and conservation outputs, you will be encouraged to explore new ideas.

### **Technical skills**


At least one of the following requirements is needed:  

* GIS: Good experience with GIS software (e.g. QGIS, ArcGIS);
* Remote Sensing: Knowledge of Remote Sensing packages (e.g. SNAP, ENVI, ErDAS);
* Data analyses: knowledge in statistics, programming, geospatial analyses with some experience in a programming language such as R or Python.
### **Other skills**

* Fluency in English
* Good communication skills
* Ability to work in a multicultural environment
* Motivation to live in remote places with simple facilities
* Sincere desire to work towards Archipelagos’ conservation efforts
### **What we offer**


We offer an internship at an inspiring institute with experts on coastal conservation. You have the opportunity to collect data for writing a thesis, scientific publications or increasing your skillset within the marine conservation sector. Internships range from 3 – 12 months, although shorter or longer internship periods may be arranged to cover the needs of groups or individuals. As Archipelagos is a non-profit research institute, the internships we offer are unpaid. The experience requires an internship weekly fee of 200 – 245 euros to cover living and research expenses (e.g. housing, 3 meals a day, public liability insurance and other research facilities). Students and recent graduates and researchers are advised to search for possible funding through their universities, by getting in touch with the International Office/ Placement/ Erasmus+ Offices at their Universities or other relevant grant providing organizations in their region.

### **Procedure**


To apply for this internship, please send an email to our admissions team outlining your program of interest and requesting an application form – admissions@archipelago.gr.

Do you aspire to gain hands-on experience as a data scientist across various sectors? Are you seeking a dynamic environment where you can kick-start your career with extensive learning opportunities, including on-the-job coaching and a diverse training curriculum? If so, consider applying for the Junior Data Scientist position at IG&H!**

  

As a Data Scientist, you will play a crucial role in helping our clients derive valuable and new insights from large and complex datasets. You start doing this by creating deep understanding of the challenges our clients are facing. Together with your team, you’ll then determine how to create most business value for our clients. Afterward, you’ll apply your knowledge and skills on data modelling in a practical setting. Methods we use range from more basic data processing techniques to machine learning and large language models. Finally, you communicate and present results convincingly, to create real and lasting impact. We believe that those who can combine analytical skills with business sense are most successful in creating this impact for our clients.

  

IG&H is active in three sectors (retail, financial services and health), allowing you to get experience on a variety of projects. On top, you'll be working closely with IG&H consultants outside of the Data & Analytics team too, such that you learn much more than only data related skills. Especially if you start your career at IG&H, this will help you in understanding what you really like doing and want to learn.  



  

Next to excellent employment conditions, working at IG&H will be a great place to kick-start your career. We believe that a caring and fun working environment will help you to dare to step out of your comfort zone and learn. In addition, we offer continuous learning through the IG&H Academy, in which you’ll get training to boost your data science, consulting and people skills. Also, you will be assigned a mentor, who will be there for you to provide you with guidance.  



  

Above all, people are at the heart of what we do. This of course comes back in the work we deliver for our clients (why make a data product if the people who need to use it don’t understand or want to use it?). At the same time, a fun working culture is key for who we are. With an inspiring office in Utrecht where we can connect, have abundant parties, team activities and sport events (both organised for the entire IG&H organization as well as specifically for the Data & Analytics team), IG&H is truly a Great Place To Work. And yes, we are certified!  



  

  

*“In addition to on-the-job learning, you learn everything you need to know about consultancy in the IG&H Academy. The program consists of various internal and external training courses and has been specifically developed for trainees. Besides training sessions, the Academy often organizes trips and dinners. Through these, you quickly develop good relationships with co-workers at IG&H. I see many of them outside of work on a regular basis”* **Jasmijn Haverhals (Consultant Healthcare)**

  

*“The most beautiful thing about consulting is the diversity within the projects. IG&H offers next to different clients, a variety in the types of assignments. One assignment could be very strategic, in which you outline the direction of a company. Whereas another assignment could be focused on implementation, in which you are working together with the client to deliver concrete results.”* **Peter Hardy (Director)**

 **What we ask:**

  

* MSc degree in Econometrics, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence or similar field
* You have excellent Dutch and English communication skills, due to client needs
* Analytical, inventive and practical
* Python and/or R skills


**What we offer you:**

  

* Working at a Great Place To Work with a pleasant atmosphere, enthusiastic colleagues who support you and many fun activities
* Continuous development through the IG&H Academy and active on the job coaching
* Permanent (indefinite) contract right away
* Excellent salary and working benefits
* Company car / good mobility scheme
* 25 holiday days with the possibility to take up to 5 more
* Generous bonus scheme
* Possibility to take a sabbatical after 3 years of employment
* IG&H facilitates a Healthy Human programme, where you get guidance with all adjustments in life, such as having a child or being a caregiver to a sick family member
* Possibility to work parttime (32 hours), at least 4 days a week
* Great opportunity to make an active contribution to the further growth of the organization
* And more, which we would love to elaborate on


**WHY IG&H?**

  


IG&H is transforming leading companies across the Health, Retail and Finance sectors. Together with our world-class technology partners, we help our clients move forward and stay relevant. With insightful advice, great design and unrivalled digital platforms. Our exceptional results come from successfully aligning people, business and technology.

-------------------


  
Stel je voor: een dynamische rol waarin je direct bijdraagt aan veiligheid, vertrouwen en duurzaamheid in transport, infrastructuur, milieu en wonen. Wij zijn op zoek naar een enthousiaste en gedreven adviseur datakwaliteit voor ons Datakwaliteitscentrum (DKC). Bij de Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT) speel jij een cruciale rol in het waarborgen van hoogwaardige datakwaliteit.



In deze uitdagende functie werk je nauw samen met ons team om de datakwaliteit in onze processen te verbeteren en te verankeren. Het DKC bevindt zich in een interessante fase van ontwikkeling en jij krijgt de kans om hieraan bij te dragen en je stempel te drukken!



Hoe jij bijdraagt in je rol



Voor een optimale informatiepositie is goede datakwaliteit essentieel. Jij speelt hierin een sleutelrol. Door grondige analyses van de datakwaliteit bepaal je samen met de business de prioriteiten en bedenk je innovatieve oplossingen. Je begeleidt en adviseert gebruikers bij het opstellen van datakwaliteitseisen, je voert gedetailleerde kwaliteitsanalyses uit en communiceert bevindingen helder met concrete verbeteradviezen. Zo ondersteun je collega’s om de datakwaliteit aanzienlijk te verbeteren. Waar nodig vertaal je deze adviezen naar functionele user stories voor ontwikkelaars.



Het DKC is volop in ontwikkeling. Samen met 3 collega’s speel je een cruciale rol in het standaardiseren van processen om de datakwaliteit binnen de ILT te verbeteren en te waarborgen. Binnen het team deel je wat je in de business tegenkomt en geef je constructieve feedback over interne standaarden en processen, zodat het DKC continu verbetert.



Als adviseur datakwaliteit maak je deel uit van team Data. Dit team is verantwoordelijk voor de realisatie van informatieproducten en functionaliteiten die informatiegestuurd werken ondersteunen. De ILT werkt met zowel intern gecreëerde data, zoals vergunninggegevens en inspectierapporten, als met extern opgevraagde data, zoals KvK-gegevens en specifieke datasets. In jouw rol schakel je effectief met verschillende partners, zoals gebruikers en producenten van data, binnen het team en de organisatie.



Dit is waar jij voldoening uit haalt



Jij geniet van een dynamische functie waarin je samenwerkt met diverse stakeholders uit verschillende disciplines. Je wilt écht begrijpen wat de gebruiker van data nodig heeft. Je haalt voldoening uit het aanpakken van uitdagende vraagstukken en het vertalen van gebruikersbehoeften in concrete betekenis voor de datakwaliteit, wat bijdraagt aan de verbetering van de maatschappelijke impact van onze organisatie. Je waardeert de mogelijkheid om oplossingen te bedenken en hierover te adviseren en je voelt je gemotiveerd door de concrete resultaten die voortkomen uit jouw werk. Daarnaast werk je makkelijk met collega’s samen en wissel je graag kennis en expertise met hen uit.



Meer weten?



We kunnen ons voorstellen dat je meer wilt weten over deze functie. Je kunt daarom altijd vrijblijvend contact opnemen met Margot van Dorst, teamleider van Team Data, via 06-52401165. Zij staat jou graag te woord! Je kunt natuurlijk ook een kijkje nemen op onze website.

Je herkent je in de volgende eigenschappen:-



Wij waarderen jouw scherpe oog voor detail, je vermogen om kritische vragen te stellen en je onderzoekende instelling waarmee je snel informatie oppikt. Met deze vaardigheden en je vermogen om uitdagingen vanuit verschillende perspectieven te benaderen, kun je complexe problemen analyseren en effectieve oplossingen aandragen.



Je bent ondernemend, initiatiefrijk en hebt een hands-on mentaliteit. Jouw oplossingsgerichte benadering draagt continu bij aan het verbeteren van de datakwaliteit en de processen in de dataketen. Je communiceert graag over je zienswijzen, oplossingen en resultaten. Je werkt soepel samen met verschillende niveaus binnen onze organisatie, omdat je je verhaal aan hen kunt aanpassen. Hierdoor overtuig je zowel inspecteurs als afdelingshoofden van jouw oplossing. Dankzij jouw bijdrage versterken we onze informatiepositie, verbeteren we onze datagedreven besluitvorming en optimaliseren we onze dienstverlening aan de samenleving. Ervaring met SQL, Python en/of R is hierbij een mooie aanvulling.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



Voor het optimale verloop van de processen binnen de Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT) is het essentieel dat wij over de juiste informatie beschikken. De afdeling Data en Analyse ziet hier op toe. Onze afdeling bestaat uit 5 teams: de teams Analyse 1 en 2, het team Data, het team Informatie-Programmering, en het team Inspectieview.



Team Data



De eerste stap in de keten zetten de dataspecialisten van team Data. Zij zorgen voor het binnenhalen van de benodigde gegevens. De data zijn veelal afkomstig van andere overheidsorganisaties, commerciële partijen en bestaande ILT-systemen. De ruwe data worden omgezet in gevalideerde en gestructureerde gegevens met de afgesproken kwaliteit. De gegevens zijn nu toegankelijk voor data-analisten. Team Data zorgt op haar beurt ook voor het leveren van ILT-data aan andere organisaties.



**Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport**
---------------------------------------



De Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport (ILT) is de toezichthouder van het ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat. Met 1.600 medewerkers zet de ILT zich dagelijks in voor een duurzame en veilige leefomgeving, veilig transport en het vertrouwen in publieke instellingen zoals woningcorporaties.



De ILT ziet erop toe dat zeer uiteenlopende doelgroepen een breed scala van wetten en regels naleven. Het aandachtsgebied van de ILT omvat ongeveer 160 onderwerpen waaronder geluidsoverlast in de luchtvaart, vaartijden in de binnenvaart, taxivergunningen, woningcorporaties, vervoer van gevaarlijke stoffen, afval, genetisch gemodificeerde organismen en energielabels van woningen.



We bewegen mee met maatschappelijke en technologische ontwikkelingen en zetten onze middelen in daar waar de risico’s voor de publieke belangen het grootst zijn. Een goed gebruik van data en andere informatie is sturend voor al onze werkzaamheden: van toezicht en vergunning- en dienstverlening tot opsporing en communicatie.



Samenwerken, leren door doen en constant verbeteren zijn onze sleutelwoorden. Medewerkers, leidinggevenden en teams krijgen de ruimte om talenten optimaal in te zetten, bevlogenheid te tonen en het verschil te maken. Welke eigenschappen wij zoeken in nieuwe medewerkers? De vaardigheid om te kunnen werken met diverse informatiebronnen, out-of-the-box kunnen denken bij toezichtsvraagstukken, de creativiteit hebben om vernieuwende methodes te bedenken en in te zetten, met lef onbekende paden durven bewandelen en overzicht kunnen houden.



Je bent welkom zoals je bent  

De Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport hecht grote waarde aan diversiteit. Verschillende perspectieven, achtergronden en inzichten vergroten de denkkracht en handelingsperspectieven van een team. Het maakt niet uit waar je bent geboren, waar je in gelooft, hoe oud je bent en van wie je houdt. We zijn vooral nieuwsgierig naar jou.

* Je hebt ervaring met digitale dataverwerking.
* Je hebt ervaring met programmeren (zoals Python of R).
* Je hebt ervaring met GIS.
* Je bent in het bezit van een rijbewijs B.
* Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal in woord en geschrift en je voelt je op je gemak met de Engelse taal.
* Ervaring met geofysische metingen is een pré.


Jij bent een verbinder en een organisator. Je houdt van regelwerk en bent proactief, leergierig, nauwkeurig en innovatief. Je weet hoe je met de juiste mensen het juiste gesprek moet voeren om iets gedaan te krijgen. Ook vind je het leuk om van de nieuwste ontwikkelingen op de hoogte te blijven


**Dit krijg je ervoor terug**
-----------------------------


Als je bij Waternet werkt, heb je uitstekende arbeidsvoorwaarden:


* Max € 4.774,- (schaal 9) bruto per maand voor 36 uur per week
* Maar liefst 21% van jouw maandsalaris bestaat uit Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB). Hiermee kan je bijvoorbeeld extra verlofuren kopen, opleiding bekostigen of laten uitbetalen als loon.
* Een arbeidsovereenkomst voor de duur van 1 jaar met de mogelijkheid op een vast contract
* Mogelijkheid om je werkzaamheden zowel thuis als op kantoor uit te voeren
* Mogelijkheid tot flexibele werktijden, afhankelijk van je werkzaamheden
* Een ruim opleidingsbudget van € 6.000,- voor jou persoonlijk
* Reiskostenvergoeding of een thuiswerkvergoeding van € 3,- netto per thuiswerkdag
* Een vergoeding van maximaal € 850,- om je thuiswerkplek in te richten
* Een pensioenverzekering via het ABP Pensioenfonds

**Werken bij Waternet**
-----------------------


Bij Waternet werk je met een uniek product: water. Samen met zo’n 2000 collega’s zorgen we voor veilig drinkwater, schone grachten, rivieren en droge voeten. Waternet werkt met de nieuwste technieken en is bijna 100% klimaatneutraal. Bij ons werken echte vakmensen: van dijkinspecteur tot dataspecialist en van techneut tot teamleider. Al deze betrokken medewerkers maken Waternet samen tot een werkgever waar je jezelf kan zijn. Wij stimuleren je om elke dag een stukje beter te worden.

En doe je werk dat elke dag direct van belang is voor de veiligheid van Nederland en onze bondgenoten.  

Informatie binnenhalen, analyseren en verspreiden  

Als Technisch OSINT Onderzoeker beschik je over sterk ontwikkelde technische vaardigheden. Met deze vaardigheden ga je aan de slag voor Bureau OSINT. Daar word je verbonden aan een of meerdere onderzoeken. Binnen de onderzoeken stem je de inlichtingenvragen af. Vervolgens ga je op zoek naar mogelijkheden om deze vragen te beantwoorden. Dat doe je bijvoorbeeld door grote hoeveelheden openbare data geautomatiseerd te ontsluiten. Deze data analyseer je door opzoek te gaan naar relevante informatie.

* inrichten van IT-infra ten behoeve van bovenstaande werkzaamheden.


Ontwikkeling  

Omdat je bij de MIVD met gevoelige informatie werkt, kun je de inhoud van je werk niet met vrienden en familie bespreken. Gelukkig kan dit wel met collega’s, en daarom bouw je met hen een sterke band op. Binnen de MIVD heerst daarom ook een onderlinge verbondenheid.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



De afdeling Inlichtingen draagt zorg voor de realisatie van all source (contra-) inlichtingenproducten ter invulling van de vastgestelde onderzoeksopdrachten ten behoeve van politieke en militaire besluitvorming. Zij is verantwoordelijk voor de coördinatie en inzet van de verwervende en verwerkende capaciteiten van de MIVD in productieteams, ten behoeve van het uitvoeren van de Geïntegreerde Aanwijzing (GA), zoals deze door behoeftestellers van het Ministerie van Defensie, Algemene Zaken, Buitenlandse Zaken, Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties en de NCTV jaarlijks wordt vastgesteld. De onderzoeksopdrachten die voortvloeien uit de GA I&V staan hierbij centraal. Daarnaast is Afdeling Inlichtingen verantwoordelijk voor het verhogen van de weerbaarheid van de Defensie-industrie en daarmee Defensie.



**Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD)**
-------------------------------------------------------



De Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD) is onderdeel van het ministerie van Defensie. De dienst ondersteunt bij het gereedstellen van de eenheden en bij militaire missies en vredesoperaties. Hiervoor verwerven we wereldwijd inlichtingen en veiligheidsinformatie op strategisch, tactisch en operationeel niveau. De MIVD speelt zo een cruciale rol bij de besluitvorming door de militaire leiding en de politieke top.



Werk je bij de MIVD, dan doe je werk dat er echt toe doet. Je draagt bij aan het beschermen van de Nederlandse belangen en de nationale veiligheid. Bovendien werk je in een zeer dynamische omgeving. We doen er alles aan om te zorgen dat je op jouw vakgebied up-to-date blijft, bijvoorbeeld door middel van opleidingen en kennisuitwisseling met onze partnerdiensten.



Omdat je bij de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdienst werkt en met gevoelige informatie te maken krijgt, kun je de inhoud van je werk niet met je vrienden en familie bespreken. Maar wel met je collega’s. Daarom bouw je een bijzondere band op met hen. Er heerst een sterke onderlinge verbondenheid die er mede voor zorgt dat de meeste mensen lang bij de organisatie blijven werken. En allemaal werken we aan hetzelfde doel: de fysieke en digitale veiligheid van 17 miljoen Nederlanders.

Daar is een groot verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel voor nodig. Ook heb jij:  

* tenminste een hbo-opleiding afgerond (bijvoorbeeld: Technische Informatica, Software Development, Software Engineering, System & Network Engineering of Data Analytics), of vergelijkbaar werk- en denkniveau;

### **De organisatie Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD)**


De Militaire Inlichtingen- en Veiligheidsdienst (MIVD) is onderdeel van het ministerie van Defensie. De dienst ondersteunt bij het gereedstellen van de eenheden en bij militaire missies en vredesoperaties. Hiervoor verwerven we wereldwijd inlichtingen en veiligheidsinformatie op strategisch, tactisch en operationeel niveau. De MIVD speelt zo een cruciale rol bij de besluitvorming door de militaire leiding en de politieke top.

We doen er alles aan om te zorgen dat je op jouw vakgebied up-to-date blijft, bijvoorbeeld door middel van opleidingen en kennisuitwisseling met onze partnerdiensten.



Omdat je bij de inlichtingen- en veiligheidsdienst werkt en met gevoelige informatie te maken krijgt, kun je de inhoud van je werk niet met je vrienden en familie bespreken. Maar wel met je collega’s. Daarom bouw je een bijzondere band op met hen. Er heerst een sterke onderlinge verbondenheid die er mede voor zorgt dat de meeste mensen lang bij de organisatie blijven werken. En allemaal werken we aan hetzelfde doel: de fysieke en digitale veiligheid van 17 miljoen Nederlanders.

### **De afdeling Inlichtingen**


De afdeling Inlichtingen draagt zorg voor de realisatie van all source (contra-) inlichtingenproducten ter invulling van de vastgestelde onderzoeksopdrachten ten behoeve van politieke en militaire besluitvorming. Zij is verantwoordelijk voor de coördinatie en inzet van de verwervende en verwerkende capaciteiten van de MIVD in productieteams, ten behoeve van het uitvoeren van de Geïntegreerde Aanwijzing (GA), zoals deze door behoeftestellers van het Ministerie van Defensie, Algemene Zaken, Buitenlandse Zaken, Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties en de NCTV jaarlijks wordt vastgesteld. De onderzoeksopdrachten die voortvloeien uit de GA I&V staan hierbij centraal. Daarnaast is Afdeling Inlichtingen verantwoordelijk voor het verhogen van de weerbaarheid van de Defensie-industrie en daarmee Defensie.

### **Bijzonderheden**

* We vragen je om niet met anderen te spreken over je sollicitatie bij de MIVD. Het kan je sollicitatie en eventuele loopbaan bij de MIVD schaden en je veiligheid in gevaar brengen.
* Een assessment en een veiligheidsonderzoek zijn onderdeel van de sollicitatieprocedure.
* Ook aan je eventuele partner en andere mensen in je omgeving worden bepaalde eisen gesteld.

**Inreda® Diabetic, een bijzonder verhaal**

Diabetes hebben in een druk leven is een uitdaging. Toen Robin Koops, oprichter van Inreda® Diabetic, zelf diabetes kreeg, ontdekte hij hoe lastig het was om steeds zijn bloedsuiker te controleren en insuline te spuiten. Met deze uitdaging ging Robin aan de slag en zo ontstond Inreda®. In zijn schuur begon hij een project dat uiteindelijk een kunstmatige alvleesklier, de Inreda AP® werd: een slim apparaat dat automatisch je bloedsuiker regelt met insuline en glucagon. Door hard werken groeide zijn idee uit tot een baanbrekende innovatie. Nu werken er ongeveer 60 mensen bij Inreda®, allemaal met één doel: het leven van mensen met diabetes verbeteren.

Als junior onderzoeker Publieke Gezondheid draag je jouw steentje bij aan een stad waar de inwoners gezond en veerkrachtig zijn. Je werkt mee aan de monitoring van de gezondheid van de inwoners en het beschikbaar maken van de informatie en kennis voor praktijk en beleid. Dit doe je in nauwe samenwerking met je collega onderzoekers publieke gezondheid, gezondheidsexperts en beleidsadviseurs. De beleidsnota Gezondheid - Samen gezondheidsverschillen verkleinen 2024 - 2027 is ons beleidskader voor het werken aan gezond stedelijk leven voor iedereen.


**Dit is je werk**
------------------


Utrecht is de stad van gezond stedelijk leven voor iedereen. Veel beleid in de gemeente heeft impact op gezondheid van de inwoners. Aan de basis van dit beleid liggen data en kennis. Onderzoekers Publieke Gezondheid monitoren hoe het met de gezondheid van de inwoners gaat en welke factoren deze gezondheid beïnvloeden. In Utrecht komt deze kennis samen in de Volksgezondheidsmonitor Utrecht (VMU). Iedere vier jaar maken we de balans op in het Utrechts Gezondheidsprofiel (UGP). Onze werkwijze is om cijfermatige informatie te combineren met ervaringen en beelden van inwoners en professionals in de stad. De VMU komt tot stand door een team van onderzoekers die in samenwerking met andere gemeentelijke collega’s, stedelijke partners en kennispartners, aan gezondheidsthema’s werken. Ter versterking van het team zoeken wij een Junior Onderzoeker Publieke Gezondheid. Je ondersteunt bij ons onderzoek en werkt actief mee aan de uitvoering van de VMU, in het bijzonder aan:

* uitvoering van werkzaamheden op de thema’s leefgewoonten en sociale omgeving: literatuur bijhouden, data analyseren, resultaten beschrijven voor de VMU-website.
* open data en dashboards bouwen (zie bijvoorbeeld Utrecht in Cijfers | Gemeente Utrecht - Nieuw en Eerste 1000 dagen van kinderen - Utrecht (incijfers.nl)
* Ondersteuning bij verdiepend kwantitatief en kwalitatief onderzoek.

Onderzoeker zijn bij een gemeente is anders dan bij een universiteit of kennisinstituut. De duiding van de cijfers in een lokale context, met professionals en inwoners is een belangrijk onderdeel van ons werk. Dat betekent dat je de lokale, regionale, politiek-bestuurlijke en maatschappelijke ontwikkelingen en vraagstukken in je onderzoek betrekt.


**Dit is je werkplek**

De gemeente Utrecht biedt ruimte aan iedereen. We zien talent als basis en diversiteit als kracht om samen betere resultaten te behalen. Voor jou is er plek bij de afdeling Volksgezondheid (VG).

Binnen dit laatste team zoeken we een junior onderzoeker. BEO bestaat uit ruim 30 mensen. Zij signaleren, monitoren, onderzoeken en agenderen relevante ontwikkelingen op het gebied van de volksgezondheid in Utrecht. Het vastgestelde volksgezondheidsbeleid vormt het bestuurlijk – politieke kader voor de uitvoering van hun werk. We werken aan het versterken van onze kennisrol. Binnen BEO werk je in het subteam Onderzoek. Dit bestaat uit ruim 10 collega’s en werkt als een zelf organiserend team. Vanuit deze basis werk je ook nauw samen met collega’s die vanuit beleid en praktijk betrokken zijn bij de volksgezondheid in de stad.

### **Rani Bainathsah, manager**


Telefoon: 06-51452564
rani.bainathsah@duo.nl

**Functieomschrijving**
-----------------------



De afdeling DUO/IP is georganiseerd in verschillende uitvoeringsteams die in de verschillende sectoren (van primair tot hoger onderwijs) of op thema (personeel, verantwoorden, stromen en NPO) direct in de klantvraag voorzien. Echter, deze teams missen door hun domeinfocus de brede blik om ook de benodigde overkoepelende data-oplossingen op te zetten, of te werken aan afdelingsbrede borging en uniformering. De data analist zal hier aan gaan werken samen met een team van 4-7 ‘data analisten’ uit de uitvoeringsteams en pakt hier de coördinatie van op.



Taken en verantwoordelijkheden



De data analist is met name betrokken bij de initiatie en beginfase van nieuwe afdelingsbrede gegevensproducten, maar speelt ook een rol bij de vernieuwing van bestaande producten, of het bewaken van de product kwaliteit.  

Samen met de data analisten uit de uitvoeringsteams concentreer jij je op:


* Het scherp krijgen van de behoeften van alle stakeholders binnen DUO/IP
* Pionieren van data-oplossingen door zelf in de data te duiken en te werken aan proof-of-concepts.
* Het ophalen van verschillende product requirements (Globale- en detailanalyse)
* Het samenwerken met ETL-ontwikkelaars voor de realisatie van het eindproduct.
* Het coördineren van de ontwikkeling van kennis rond processen, databronnen, en de organisatie
* Het bewaken en definiëren van de datakwaliteit


Omdat de data analist zelf aan de slag gaat met data, de productanalyse begeleidt, stuurt op datakwaliteit, en samen met de Product Owner de werkzaamheden van de data analisten uit de uitvoeringsteams coördineert, bevat de functie elementen uit de functieprofielen van coördinerend business-, informatie- en data-analist, en een data steward. De rol van data analist is daarom een afwisselende functie.


**Functie-eisen**
-----------------



Als data analist ben je datavaardig, krijg je energie van samenwerken, en ben je goed in plannen en organiseren. Jij hebt de volgende competenties, kennis, en ervaring:


* Je bent hbo- of academisch opgeleid, bij voorkeur in een data of ICT gerelateerd vakgebied.
* Je hebt werkervaring op het gebied van business- of informatieanalyse.
* Je hebt werkervaring op het gebied van data analyse.
* Je hebt ervaring met het coördineren van werkzaamheden
* Ervaring met data steward werkzaamheden is een pré
* Je hebt interesse in datawarehousing, ETL-processen, en de productie van metadata.
* Je bent flexibel, en klant-, omgevings- en resultaatgericht.
* Ervaring met SQL en R, Python of PowerCenter zijn een pré.
* Ervaring met Agile werken en DataOps zijn een pré.
* Ervaring met Jira is een pré
* Je hebt interesse in maatschappelijke en politieke thema’s die spelen in het onderwijsveld.
**Arbeidsvoorwaarden**

Naast het salaris ontvang je een individueel keuzebudget (IKB). Het IKB bestaat uit geld (16,5% van je bruto jaarsalaris) en tijd. Met het IKB maak jij de keuzes die bij jou passen en kun je een deel van je arbeidsvoorwaarden zelf samenstellen. Je kunt er bijvoorbeeld voor kiezen om een deel van je maandinkomen te laten uitbetalen wanneer jij dat wenst. Ook kun je dit budget omzetten in verlof en andersom of besteden aan fiscaalvriendelijke doelen. De Rijksoverheid hecht sterk aan persoonlijke groei en loopbaanontwikkeling en biedt daarvoor tal van mogelijkheden. Tot de secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden behoren onder meer verschillende studiefaciliteiten, bedrijfsfitness, volledige vergoeding van je ov-reiskosten woon-werkverkeer. Ook bieden we je de mogelijkheid om de voor jou belangrijke feestdagen te vieren zonder dat je daar een vrije dag voor hoeft op te nemen. Hemelvaartsdag en/of 2e pinksterdag kun je bijvoorbeeld inruilen voor een andere feestdag. Hierover maak je afspraken met je leidinggevende.

Het landbouw- en voedselsysteem staat volop in de belangstelling. De grote vraag voor politiek, beleid en samenleving is: hoe kan dat systeem verduurzamen, en hoe kan de uitstoot van stikstof en broeikasgassen worden teruggedrongen? Het PBL analyseert en reflecteert op de huidige en toekomstige ontwikkelingen binnen de landbouw. Daarnaast monitort het samen met andere kennisinstituten de voortgang van het stikstofbeleid en het klimaatbeleid. Wij zoeken een enthousiaste en ervaren onderzoeker die zich in dit complexe vraagstuk wil verdiepen.



Wat ga je doen?  

Jij gaat je voornamelijk richten op kwantitatieve analyses van het beleid; hoe werken de verschillende beleidsinstrumenten, tot welke veranderingen in het landbouwsysteem leiden ze en wat zijn de gevolgen voor de uitstoot van stikstof- en broeikasgassen? Je buigt je hierbij over de emissie-effecten en de kosten van verschillende aspecten van de landbouw, variërend van innovatieve technologieën voor stallen en mestverwerking tot extensievere vormen van landbouw, zoals natuur-inclusieve landbouw. Ook ga je je verdiepen in recente ontwikkelingen, zoals de mogelijkheden en knelpunten rond ‘doelsturing’ en het meten van bedrijfsspecifieke emissies. Ons onderzoek betreft tot nu toe vooral het nationale beleid, maar we richten ons vizier in toenemende mate op de rol van provincies.



Dit werk doe je niet alleen; je werkt samen met een aantal collega’s in projecten. Sommige projecten ga je als (deel)projectleider coördineren. Je levert bijdragen aan verschillende rapporten, zoals onze jaarlijkse Klimaat- en Energieverkenning (KEV), en de analyse van verkiezingsprogramma’s. Daarnaast heb je een aansturende rol in de verdere ontwikkeling van de rapportage- en evaluatiesystematiek. Om je werk goed te kunnen doen heb je veel contact met interne en externe collega’s en andere betrokkenen; denk aan het management van het PBL, beleidsmakers, vertegenwoordigers van belangenorganisaties en onderzoekers van universiteiten en andere kennisinstellingen.



Verdere invulling van de functie doen we graag in overleg en is afhankelijk van jouw eigen vakinhoudelijke achtergrond en interesse.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
* Je hebt een afgeronde academische opleiding op het gebied van Environmental Sciences, Agricultural Sciences, Sustainable Development, (Agricultural) Economics of een aanverwant terrein, bij voorkeur afgesloten met een promotie.
* Je hebt minstens 5 jaar ervaring met relevant onderzoek in multidisciplinaire onderzoeksteams, waarbij je ook ervaring hebt opgedaan met het leiden van projecten.
* Je hebt ervaring en affiniteit met kwantitatieve analyses op basis van modellering (bij voorkeur ervaring met Python en/of R). Ervaring met GIS-analyses is een pre.
* Je hebt ervaring met het uitvoeren van ex ante en ex post beleidsevaluaties en -verkenningen.
* Je hebt kennis van het nationale en Europese landbouwbeleid en de ketenafhankelijkheden in de landbouwsector en bijbehorende beleidsvraagstukken; je hebt daarnaast kennis van en affiniteit met vraagstukken rond emissies van stikstof en broeikasgassen in de landbouwsector. Je hebt bij voorkeur een netwerk met relevante experts en beleidsmakers.
* Je hebt gevoel voor de dynamische beleidscontext waarin het Planbureau voor de Leefomgeving opereert en de verschillende maatschappelijke belangen die spelen rond landbouw.


Je herkent jezelf in de volgende eigenschappen of zou deze willen ontwikkelen:


* Je bent conceptueel sterk en bent in staat complexe inhoudelijke vraagstukken te vertalen in beleidsrelevante analyses, rapporten en boodschappen.
* Je werkt graag met cijfers en werkt nauwgezet en traceerbaar.
* Het spreekt je aan om te werken op het snijvlak van wetenschap en beleid.
* Je kunt goed plannen en organiseren, en bent in staat om onderzoeksvragen in heldere werkafspraken te vertalen, zowel intern als extern. Je weet hierbij de juiste partijen binnen en buiten het instituut te raadplegen en in te zetten voor het beantwoorden van de onderzoeksvragen.
* Je wisselt kennis, informatie en ideeën uit met collega’s en vraagt actief feedback op eigen ideeën. Je ondersteunt collega’s gevraagd en ongevraagd bij de werkzaamheden.
* Je bent vaak verantwoordelijk voor de voortgang van het onderzoek. Je stuurt tijdig bij en informeert tijdig leidinggevenden bij problemen of tegenvallers.
* Je hebt goede schrijfvaardigheden en goede mondelinge vaardigheden, in het Nederlands en het Engels.


Voldoe je (nog) niet aan de functie-eisen of heb je aangepaste werkomstandigheden nodig? Licht dan in je motivatiebrief toe hoe jij een bijdrage kunt leveren aan onze organisatie en wat je daarvoor (van ons) nodig hebt. We kijken graag hoe we een match kunnen maken waarbij jij goed tot je recht komt.

-----------------


Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is offering a fully funded, four-year PhD-position, as part of the European Research Council (ERC) project “Where are the Humanities in the Medical Humanities? How Comics Can Improve Healthcare Training, Practice, and Dissemination” (2024-2029), led by Dr. Erin La Cour at the Faculty of Humanities. **The start date of the position is February 1, 2025.**


How can healthcare become more attentive to individual patient experiences? How can we *talk with* and *talk back to* practitioners and systems? What tools are needed to open productive dialogue?


This ERC project will critically elaborate the benefits of further integrating insights from the Humanities in the Critical Medical and Health Humanities by examining and expanding discourse on Graphic Medicine. A flourishing field that utilizes theoretical and artistic research practices in productive reciprocal exchange, Graphic Medicine is attentive to how the study and production of comics about health and healthcare echo calls within the Critical Medical and Health Humanities for the urgent need for different understandings and expressions of illness and disability than those found in conventional medical discourse. Focused on bottom-up, experiential knowledge, Graphic Medicine promotes comics as an important medium to depict interactions between individuals, their families and carers, a wide array of healthcare workers, and healthcare systems as scenes of intercultural, interdiscursive, and intergenerational encounter.


Through cross-national, cross-cultural, and cross-linguistic analyses of Graphic Medicine, from healthcare education to online information, and from individual artistic practices to collaborations between comics artists and healthcare institutions, this project will critically and comprehensively evaluate and develop the aims, current applications, and potential of Graphic Medicine across five individual subprojects. In so doing, it will also advance an understanding of creative practices as capable of critiquing and producing theory, will develop the discourse of what counts as healthcare knowledge, and will contribute to the aims of the Critical Medical and Health Humanities to offer new insights for healthcare training, practice, and dissemination.


**Graphic Medicine Online**


The PhD subproject, Graphic Medicine Online, will contribute to the overall aims of the ERC project through a comparative analysis of available online information on Graphic Medicine in English, Dutch, and French. Utilizing (and modifying) open-access data crawling software to aggregate available online information about Graphic Medicine in these three languages, including primary texts (comics) and secondary texts (theoretical and popular articles, blog posts, etc.), the PhD will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate how the discourse and practice of Graphic Medicine travels and shifts across national, cultural, and/or linguistic contexts. In so doing, it will create a comprehensive overview of Graphic Medicine in and across these three languages, and, through developing an online database of the project’s findings, will create an unprecedented resource for the advancement of research in the field.


*Key outputs of the PhD subproject:*


* An open-access and keyword searchable database of Graphic Medicine comics and scholarly and publicly-oriented articles on Graphic Medicine in English, Dutch, and French, including works translated into these languages, built from the aggregated information the PhD has collected, assessed, and keyword tagged (e.g. country of origin, language, translation, topic(s), perspective(s), discipline(s), target audience(s), source reliability, etc.). \*The database will be supported by a web programmer who will assist in preparing the backend database for a frontend website.
* A PhD dissertation on the project’s research methods and findings. Through a discussion of the project’s development of digital methods to create ways of finding, scraping, tagging, comparing, and translating the mentions of Graphic Medicine online in the three languages, and a visualization of the crawler’s trace to show the nodes of research and discourse, the PhD will develop theory through its method. The project will also seek to answer how much information is available and to which audience, how the discourse travels, and what shifts in meaning arise through translation into different national, cultural, and/or linguistic contexts. As such, the PhD dissertation will contribute to the field an engagement with the need for greater access to and dissemination of Graphic Medicine and the importance of accessibility to reliable healthcare information.


**Your duties**


* conduct research for and complete a PhD dissertation, as outlined above
* create an open-access and keyword searchable database of Graphic Medicine, as outlined above
* publish three (individually or co-authored) peer-reviewed journal articles or book chapters
* present research at national and international conferences
* collaborate with the team on research dissemination, including co-organizing workshops and conferences, and preparing a collected volume


**Your profile**

* you have demonstrable knowledge of and experience with digital methods, including data collection, quantitative and qualitative analysis, programming languages (e.g. Python, R), scripting and coding, and preferably, knowledge of and experience with natural language processing (NLP)
* you have outstanding research skills as evidenced by strong BA and MA transcripts, and are motivated to conduct high quality research with the aim of publication in top journals
* you have an affinity for working interdisciplinarily, collaboratively, and within a team of researchers

Onsite
Netflix is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with 278 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

 **The Role**


Our mission at Netflix is to connect global stories with global audiences. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.


Recently, Netflix has expanded its entertainment offering to include Live content, like The Roast of Tom Brady Comedy Special, the SAG Awards ceremony, and The Netflix Slam tennis match. Our scope will grow to include premium live entertainment with our growing Live content catalogue, including WWE, NFL, and more.


Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips. This is made possible because Netflix UI is a thriving learning machine where Artwork & Video assets are personalized via reinforcement learning.

* Be a strategic partner for Studio & Creative Production teams: identify critical analytical problems and apply an entrepreneurial mindset to find innovative solutions with data
* Being the lead analytics engineer partnering with our Product Creative Studio partners who are responsible for the promotional assets for Live content experiences.
* Drive the direction of your work, developing solutions that span from scrappy code and prototype tools to high-visibility dashboards and analyses for Studio & Creative Production leadership
* Spearhead the creation of new metrics that impact decision-making
* Collaborate with Data Scientists & Data Engineers to source data from new systems and strengthen our foundational data models
* Become a regional expert on all things Studio Data Science & Engineering, helping educate and connect regional offices to existing data solutions

**You are…**

* A strong communicator who can develop and deepen strong relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders. You have experience partnering closely with executive leadership, with a proven track record of influencing strategic decisions through data.
* Comfortable with ambiguity; able to thrive with minimal oversight and process. You connect the dots across business needs and independently drive projects forward.
* A senior analytics professional with extensive experience across data wrangling, analysis, reporting, and visualization.
* An expert in a data-oriented programming language (e.g. SQL, Python, R, Scala, etc.) and intuitive dashboard/visualization design (e.g. Tableau)
* Proficient in ETL and data warehousing best practices and core statistics concepts (e.g. hypothesis testing)
* Adept at working across different cultures on a globally-distributed team, with core working hours in the Central European and GMT time zones

**Culture**


You will have the opportunity to impact the business in a meaningful way, working alongside smart people who love to solve hard problems, and who not only expect but also foster high performance.

*“AFEP is een unieke plek: dicht op de politiek, diep in de inhoud en een hecht team”* – Karlijn Kersten (afdelingshoofd)



Stagelopen in het hart van de financieel-economische besluitvorming van Nederland. Dat doe je bij de directie Algemene Financiële en Economische Politiek (AFEP) van het ministerie van Financiën. Hier werken we aan de belangrijkste economische en politieke dossiers. Een evenwichtige koopkrachtontwikkeling voor huishoudens, de verschuivende vermogensverdeling en de rol van belastingen hierin, de omvangrijke opgave om Nederland klimaatneutraal te maken, goed werkende ondersteuning voor mensen met schulden: het is een kleine greep uit de actuele onderwerpen die ons bezighouden.


**Jouw stage**  

Als stagiair bij AFEP help jij ons om duidelijke en bruikbare economische adviezen te geven aan de politiek. Dit doe je door middel van analyses en onderzoek die besluitvorming ondersteunen, maar je krijgt natuurlijk ook ruimte om eigen initiatieven te ontwikkelen en verschillende hoeken van politiek Den Haag te verkennen.



In deze stage help je het team dat met een economische bril kijkt naar belastingen. Belastingen financieren de overheid en maken daarmee onze ambities voor de zorg, infrastructuur en sociale zekerheid mogelijk. Maar hoe bepalen we wat ieders juiste bijdrage is? De vraag ‘wie betaalt wat’ is de rode draad in het gesprek binnen het ministerie van Financiën sinds zijn vroegste bestaan. Jij helpt ons de discussie hierover naar een hoger plan te tillen door inzichtelijk te maken hoe belastingen verdeeld worden over verschillende doelgroepen en hoe ze de werking van de economie raken. Daarnaast is er ruimte om bij te dragen aan vraagstukken die tijdens jouw stage actueel zijn. Dit kan over belastingen gaan, maar ook over andere uiteenlopende onderwerpen, afhankelijk van de actualiteit. Onze stagiairs hebben eerder bijvoorbeeld gewerkt aan onderwijsbeleid, klimaatbeleid en coronasteun en hun onderzoek is gebruikt in de politieke besluitvorming en gepubliceerd in vakbladen, zoals ESB. Je stage is dus een mix tussen langer lopende verdieping en politieke actualiteit.



Natuurlijk doe je dit niet alleen. Tijdens jouw stage maak je onderdeel uit van een jonge en hechte directie. De sfeer bij AFEP is informeel en gedreven. Je krijgt veel verantwoordelijkheid, maar ook goede begeleiding en veel kansen om te leren.



Om het meeste uit deze stage te kunnen halen, is het prettig als je bedreven bent in analytisch werk, geïnteresseerd in maatschappelijke vraagstukken en een goed oog hebt voor politiek-bestuurlijke besluitvorming. Tijdens je stage krijg je uiteraard de kans om al deze vaardigheden verder te ontwikkelen en in de praktijk te brengen. Bovenal vind je het leuk om naar creatieve oplossingen te zoeken, leg je makkelijk contacten en werk je samen met anderen om jouw werk verder te brengen.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
* Je bevindt je in de laatste fase van je wo-bachelor, of volgt een master, die een economisch of maatschappelijk karakter combineert met kwantitatieve vaardigheden. Ervaring met Excel vereist, ervaring met R een pre.
* Je bent in staat om structuur aan te brengen in complexe materie en beschikt over een goed analytisch denkvermogen.
* Je hebt interesse in politiek-bestuurlijke krachtvelden en wilt graag leren over de verschillende rollen en belangen in de politiek. Interesse in maatschappelijke vraagstukken is dan ook een must.
* Je spreekt en schrijft goed Nederlands.
* Je bent minimaal vijf maanden ten minste vier dagen per week beschikbaar. De sterke voorkeur gaat uit naar zes maanden voltijds. Over jouw startdatum kan worden overlegd.


Ben je enthousiast geworden om samen met je wellicht toekomstige collega’s te werken aan de puzzels voor een beter Nederland? Dan maken we graag kennis met je. Eerst nog even verder praten? Neem dan contact op met: Tim Mulder – [email protected] of Sam Peeperkorn – [email protected].

Met jouw unieke bijdrage spelen we beter in op de behoeften uit onze samenleving.


* Draag jij graag bij aan een financieel gezond Nederland? Je bent van harte welkom. Solliciteren kan door je cv en motivatie in te sturen. Maar we staan ook open voor andere vormen, zoals een video- (met bijgevoegd je cv) of presentatie-sollicitatie (in PowerPoint). In het laatste geval plak je de link van je sollicitatie in een PDF- of Word-bestand. Zo kunnen we je sollicitatie goed verwerken.

**Ministerie van Financiën**
----------------------------



**Samen werken aan een financieel gezond Nederland**  

Het werk van het ministerie van Financiën gaat over meer dan cijfers en geld alleen. Het gaat over mensen zoals jij en ik. Mensen met verwachtingen, zorgen, vragen, dromen en plannen. We rekenen bijvoorbeeld allemaal op financiering voor goede zorg en goed onderwijs. Op duidelijkheid over belastingtarieven en op betrouwbare banken en verzekeraars, in Nederland en daarbuiten. En we rekenen allemaal op duidelijkheid over exportregels en wat we wel en niet mee mogen nemen vanuit de vakantiebestemming.



Het ministerie van Financiën luistert naar wat er speelt in de samenleving van vandaag en heeft aandacht voor hoe Nederlanders hun toekomst zien. Met die kennis en inzichten leggen we samen met andere ministeries en binnen ons internationale netwerk de juiste verbindingen en brengen we Nederland verder. We zorgen ervoor dat Nederland en onze economie klaar zijn voor de steeds sneller veranderende wereld van morgen. Op alle fronten. Dat gaat niet vanzelf. En natuurlijk is daar ook geld voor nodig. Dat geld brengen burgers en bedrijven via belastingen bijeen, en verdeelt de overheid over zaken die we als samenleving belangrijk vinden. Daarvoor moeten er keuzes worden gemaakt en worden ingegrepen als dat nodig is. Om ons land financieel gezond te houden, moet onze economie namelijk in balans blijven en tegelijk ook ruimte krijgen om te groeien.



Samen zorgen we ervoor dat er in Nederland kansen zijn voor welvaart en groei voor iedereen, vandaag, morgen en daarna. Samen werken we aan een financieel gezond Nederland.  

  

Onze kernwaarden: integer, deskundig, duidelijk, durf en samenwerken zijn leidend voor ons gedrag en geven ons een gezamenlijke taal, waarmee we onderling bespreekbaar maken wat we doen en hoe we dat doen.

Als data analist speel je een cruciale rol in de informatieketen door data te analyseren en inzichten te genereren, binnen een maatschappelijke context. Deze analyses ondersteunen de ontwikkeling van informatiemodellen en functionaliteiten, zo maak jij het verschil.

**Wat ga je doen**


Je begint je dag als LFI data analist om 9:00 op het RIVM-kantoor in Bilthoven of thuis met een stand-up meeting. Hierbij worden de voortgang en knelpunten van huidige projecten en de algemene situatie binnen het LFI Datalab besproken. Daarna ga je verder met de ontwikkeling van verschillende soorten informatieproducten, van een dashboard dat het lab landschap van Nederland in kaart brengt tot het visualiseren van real-time GGD-informatie. Tijdens de pauze is er tijd voor ontspanning, zoals een boswandeling of een gezellige lunch in de kantine.

**Waar staat de LFI voor?**


De Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) is een nieuw organisatieonderdeel van het RIVM. Het is de missie van de LFI om samen met haar ketenpartners de impact van de volgende pandemie op de volksgezondheid zo klein mogelijk te houden. Bij een infectieziektecrisis die een landelijke aanpak vereist, zorgt de LFI voor snelle opschaling en centrale aansturing van de medisch-operationele processen bij de GGD’en, zoals testen en vaccineren.


Om samen met de ketenpartners goed voorbereid te zijn, voert de LFI regie op onder andere het opleiden, trainen en oefenen van medewerkers en het maken van afspraken over informatievoorziening en snelle beschikbaarheid van grote aantallen medewerkers. Door de sterke verbinding met de GGD’en en het Centrum Infectieziektebestrijding (CIb) van het RIVM, kan de LFI snel opschalen bij een infectieziektecrisis.


De implementatie van de LFI is eind 2023 gestart en is naar verwachting eind 2026 voltooid. In deze periode geeft de LFI samen met GGD’en, andere onderdelen van het RIVM en het ministerie van VWS concrete invulling aan de ontwerpen voor onder andere aansturing, opgeschaalde diagnostiek en behandelen, grootschalig klantcontact, logistiek, scenario-ontwerp, crisiscommunicatie, informatiemanagement, inkoop, facilitaire diensten en financiën.

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development

#LI-ROBBERT  

Defensie zet zich in voor de belangen, welvaart en vrijheid van Nederland. We zijn dagelijks actief in binnen- en buitenland. Onze wereldwijde inzet versterkt de internationale samenwerking en zorgt ervoor dat mensen zich in vrijheid kunnen ontplooien. Nu en in de toekomst.



Bij het ministerie van Defensie werken ongeveer 56.000 mensen direct en indirect aan vrede en veiligheid. Het ministerie bestaat uit het Commando Materieel & IT (COMMIT), de Bestuursstaf (het departement), de Koninklijke Marine, de Koninklijke Landmacht, de Koninklijke Luchtmacht, de Koninklijke Marechaussee, het Defensie Ondersteuningscommando (DOSCO).

### **De afdeling JIVC, Security**


Waar ga je werken?  

Het Defensie Cyber Security Centrum (DCSC) levert een unieke proactieve en reactieve bijdrage aan de beveiliging van informatie op IT-netwerken en (wapen)systemen van Defensie en de Nederlandse samenleving (zgn. digitale weerbaarheid). Daarbij is het DCSC hét aanspreekpunt voor defensieve cyber binnen Defensie. DCSC werkt samen met nationale en internationale partners aan de bescherming van ‘digitale informatie’, innovaties en kennisopbouw binnen het digitale domein. Het DCSC anticipeert op de toenemende dynamiek en complexiteit in het cyberdomein. De dienstverlening is zowel richtinggevend als ondersteunend aan de digitale weerbaarheid van Defensie.



Binnen het NIST Cyber Security Framework (met de capabilities IDENTIFY, PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND en RECOVER) is het DCSC defensie-breed richtinggevend voor de capabilities DETECT en RESPOND. Het DCSC ondersteunt de uitvoering van de overige NIST-capabilities binnen Defensie met o.a. informatie en advies.



Het Team  

De opdracht van team CTI is het leveren van vanuit intelligence requirements gevormde CTI aan het DCSC, Defensie en derden ter verbetering van risicoanalyses en detectiemogelijkheden. CTI is geen eenrichtingsverkeer, belangrijk is dat er een samenspel ontstaat met de diverse afdelingen zodat dreigingen voortijdig herkend en verholpen kunnen worden. CTI is binnen het cyber security domein een vrije jonge discipline en volop in beweging, zo komen er voor het team qua werkzaamheden nog veel ontwikkelingen aan.

### **Bijzonderheden**


Visie  

Het Commando Materieel & IT (COMMIT) ondersteunt de transitie naar een informatiegestuurde en technologisch hoogwaardige krijgsmacht met het beste materieel en de beste IT. Ons COMMITment is groot om de cruciale rol te versterken als strategisch partner van de Commandant der Strijdkrachten, van de operationele onderdelen en van internationale partners. COMMIT vergroot de impact van de ondersteuning door een integrale en innovatieve aanpak van materieel- en IT-projecten, (wapen)systeemmanagement en ketenlogistiek.



Wij investeren in de kwaliteit van onze mensen en de flexibiliteit en diversiteit van het personeelsbestand. De belangrijkste capaciteiten van COMMIT zijn de kennis en ervaring van ons personeel. Om de krijgsmacht sneller te voorzien van materieel en IT zetten wij naast technologische innovatie in op proces- en sociale innovatie op het gebied van projectvoering, inkoop en afstoting van defensiematerieel en personele en logistieke ondersteuning.



Het uitvoeren van innovatieve projecten vraagt om meer samenwerking met het bedrijfsleven, kennisinstituten en andere overheidsorganisaties en maatschappelijke instanties. Onder de vlag van C-COMMIT als National Armaments Director (NAD) ontwikkelen en versterken wij ook de internationale samenwerking op het gebied van materieel en IT (NAVO, EU, multinationaal en bilateraal).

Als data analist heb je contact met de business om datavragen te vertalen naar het daadwerkelijk ontsluiten van data op het Azure dataplatform. Je bent hiervoor gewend om requirements op te halen bij eindgebruikers en de benodigde databronnen hiervoor te analyseren. Aan de hand van de brondata en de requirements van de eindgebruikers ben je in staat een stermodel (Kimball) te ontwerpen zodat de data optimaal wordt voor rapportage. Je implementeert het stermodel met SQL en maakt in samenwerking met de eindgebruikers de gewenste visualisaties in Power BI.  

  

Op het dataplatform wordt alle soorten data van de organisatie ontsloten, waaronder GIS-data. Samen met jouw 7 collega’s werk je binnen het Datalab aan het opleveren van dashboards en visualisaties voor verschillende teams binnen Rijnland ter ondersteuning van de digitale transitie. Je levert een bijdrage aan bijvoorbeeld rapportages over bestrijdingsmiddelen, kwaliteit van zwemwater of het in beeld brengen van de effecten van maatregelen in ons beheergebied.  

  

Jouw 3 belangrijkste werkzaamheden zijn:* In gesprek gaan met de business om de vragen en wensen (requirements) verder uit te diepen en op te vragen om zo de vraag achter de vraag te achterhalen;
* Data modelleren ten behoeve van het uitbreiden van het aanbod aan data op het dataplatform zodat we de organisatie steeds beter kunnen ondersteunen in data gedreven werken;
* (Ondersteunen bij) het maken van dashboards en rapportages in PowerBI.

  

Kortom, je bent dagelijks bezig om de organisatie en het Datalab in bijzonder te helpen opbouwen en je eigen plek daarbinnen vorm te geven. Dat betekent veel vrijheid! Je werkt soms in Rotterdam vanwege intensieve samenwerking met het Hoogheemraadschap van Schieland en de Krimpenerwaard, maar meestal in Leiden of thuis.  

**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


Bij het Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland, het oudste waterschap van Nederland. Vanuit Leiden werken we met zo’n 900 medewerkers elke dag aan droge voeten en schoon water en in alles wat we doen, houden we rekening met de klimaatverandering. Op www.rijnland.net/wat-doet-rijnland kun je daar alles over lezen. Ons moderne en lichte kantoor in Leiden is een heerlijke werkplek met een uitstekend bedrijfsrestaurant, is goed bereikbaar met het OV en er is gratis parkeergelegenheid voor de deur als je verder weg woont.
**Wat vragen we van jou als data analist?**
-------------------------------------------


Je bent analytisch sterk en weet daarnaast ook goed de verbinding te maken tussen de business, data en het dataplatform. Zo weet je de vraag achter de vraag te achterhalen en zie je snel verbanden met andere projecten of werkzaamheden. Tot slot ben je flexibel en ben je dus bereid om zowel Leiden als Rotterdam te werken.  

  

Verder vragen we:* Hbo werk- en denkniveau;
* Tenminste 3 jaar werkervaring in het modelleren van data m.b.v. PowerBI;
* Ervaring met het werken in scrumteams;
* Kennis en/of ervaring met Git, Azure DevOps, Azure Synapse, PowerBI, SQL en Python.

**Dit krijg je**
----------------


* Een jaarcontract met uitzicht op onbepaalde tijd;
* Een salaris van minimaal € 3.952,- en maximaal € 5.376,- (schaal 10) bruto per maand op basis van een fulltime dienstverband van 36 uur per week;
* Een Individueel Keuzebudget (IKB) van 21% van je salaris. Hiermee kun je tot 27 uur per maand extra verlof kopen, laten uitbetalen als loon of bijstorten in je pensioen;
* Persoonlijk ontwikkelingsbudget van € 6.000,- voor 5 jaar;
* Reiskostenvergoeding van 23 cent per kilometer (gebaseerd op onze rekentool) én een NS-Businesscard op aanvraag. Werk je thuis? Dan krijg je een thuiswerkvergoeding van € 3 euro netto per dag;
* Een fietsregeling én een fietsenmaker die eens per maand bij ons kantoor je fiets repareert tegen materiaalkosten. Je fiets staat veilig in onze bewaakte fietsenstalling;
* 151,2 verlofuren per jaar op basis van een fulltime dienstverband;
* Een thuiswerkbudget van € 850 euro per 5 jaar;
* Pensioen bij het ABP. Binnen een half jaar na indiensttreding kun je je oude pensioen meenemen naar het ABP;
* Bijdrage aan je sportabonnement;
* Uitruilen van officiële feestdagen voor andere religieuze of culturele feestdagen;
* Excellent ouderschapsverlof waarbij wij je uitkering aanvullen tot 100%;
* Jaarlijkse salarisverhoging van 2,5% zolang je nog niet aan de max zit. Eventuele cao-verhogingen komen hier nog bovenop;

The bank is currently reshaping it’s risk models (Future Model Landscape). This is important to optimize our capital position, balancing the risks of our lending activities.


The ECB/DNB sets strict standards to develop, maintain and implement our risk models. Especially regarding the data that we use as input for the Risk Models. They expect us to use historical and present data, which reflect a realistic view on our historical and current client portfolio. With a high quality and with a high level of track and traceability. All this, to prevent banks from taking too much risks e.g. by minimizing their reserves.


As remediation department, we need to arrange data that can be used for risk modelling and other risk related calculations such as Risk Weighted Assets(RWA) Calculations.

Als gevolg van jouw inspanningen neemt het zicht op en inzicht in onder meer ondermijnende criminaliteit toe met als doel de effectiviteit van de ondermijningsaanpak in de gemeente Gouda te bevorderen.

Flexcity is a leading demand response aggregator of The Netherlands. Flexcity's core business is to support the balance of the electricity grid by operating its large portfolio of flexible, fully automated assets. Flexcity's portfolio consists of a wide range of technologies, such as batteries, decentralised generation and large industrial processes. Flexcity also integrates renewable energy sources into its portfolio, opening up new revenue streams for emerging technologies.


Flexcity supports many industrial companies in reducing their total electricity procurement costs and is a frontrunner in energy innovation. As a member of the team, you will contribute to a sustainable low-carbon energy sector. You will also come into contact with numerous innovative and state-of-the-art technologies, such as IoT, machine learning and blockchain.

 **Job Description** **Your role**


Flexcity is looking for a Demand response market analyst. You will join a dynamic team that is committed to the energy transition, and in which you will immediately be given your own responsibilities. On the basis of the technical data that you will receive and taking into account the current market conditions, you will calculate the flexible power potential of industrial customers. You win the customer's trust by making clear assumptions about the industrial process, and convince the customer with quality studies. You work closely with a Technical Account Manager within the team, who is in direct contact with the customer. Together, you translate the detailed studies into an easily understandable proposal for the customer. Your communication skills (written and oral) are therefore just as important as your analytical skills!


In addition, you will be involved in the day-to-day valorisation of Flexcity's portfolio on the reserve markets. Flexcity is a leading aggregator in The Netherlands and other European countries. You will contribute to the strategic bids and calculate the settlements for the industrial clients. In doing so, you scrupulously apply the rules of the system operator TenneT and take into account the market conditions (imbalance prices, etc). A good knowledge of the Dutch energy market or a profound interest in this topic is therefore a must.

**Your responsibilities**

* For new sites, assess the flexibility characteristics of the installations
* Identify and quantify the various risks
* Based on the flexibility characteristics and our current portfolio, evaluate the value that the sites could add to the portfolio
* Together with the technical account manager, draw up technical proposals for new and existing clients and provide technical support
* Assist with the integration of the assets into our portfolio
* You offer client support and communicate directly with our clients

  

**Qualifications** **Your skills and profile**

* Database design and management skills
* Database structures and algorithms skills
* Data preparation and pattern recognition
* Strong analytical skills for data analysis
* Proactive approach and strong sense of responsibility
* Technical interest in new technologies and passion for energy are a must
* Fluent in English and Dutch. Any other language is a plus
* You have a master's degree, preferably in engineering
* You are flexible, not afraid to think outside the box and you love to share your knowledge
* You are results-oriented with a pragmatic and professional attitude
* You are a team player with a ""can do"" mentality
* Strong written and oral communication skills, both internally and externally

  

**Additional Information** **Our offer**

Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

 **The Role**


Our mission at Netflix is to connect global stories with global audiences. When a Netflix member opens our app, we have a few precious moments to help them choose a story that is right for them at that instance. Presenting them evidence – Artwork, Trailers, Synopses – that authentically represents each title and resonates with the member is essential to this effort.


Recently, Netflix has expanded its entertainment offering to include Live content, like The Roast of Tom Brady Comedy Special, the SAG Awards ceremony, and The Netflix Slam tennis match. Our scope will grow to include premium live entertainment with our growing Live content catalogue, including WWE, NFL, and more.


Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips. This is made possible because Netflix UI is a thriving learning machine where Artwork & Video assets are personalized via reinforcement learning.


Europe is a significant center for our broader Studio and Creative Production teams. We’re looking for a Senior Analytics Engineer based in our Amsterdam office to join our growing European team. In this role, you would serve as a trusted partner for regional Creative Production leadership. Given this data & insights rich landscape, we are looking for a highly motivated Senior Analytics Engineer to partner with business teams and product managers to empower how we create Artwork and Trailers. This is an opportunity for you to have direct influence on strategic decisions through technical and business thought partnership that will ultimately shape promotional content.

**As a Senior Analytics Engineer in this space, you will…**

We look for people with this mindset before anything else. We welcome various levels of experience and seniority. What we value the most is your curiosity and willingness to learn. Looking forward to meeting you!

### **THIS IS YOUR DREAM JOB IF…**


✅ You love creating value by solving various problems with data, in the most sustainable and robust way.  

✅ You are trained as a data analyst, scientist or engineer but have a deep interest in data modelling and software engineering best practices.  

✅ You are a jack-of-all-trades, who wants to become a true authority in the field by learning new skills and trying out the latest data tools.  

✅ You have excellent communication skills, are interested in learning about the whole data cycle, can write efficient SQL queries, know the basics of Python, and you stand out for your expertise in one or more areas of analytics engineering.  

  

THIS IS NOT YOUR DREAM JOB IF…  

❌ You always take the academic approach to data and analytics and find it hard to be pragmatic.  

❌ You do not enjoy communicating with stakeholders, getting to know the needs of the business, and formulating sustainable solutions.  

❌ You do not want to become an authority. You are hesitant to take a proactive approach and bring your ideas forward.  

❌ You dislike sharing knowledge by leading trainings, organizing workshops, or writing blog posts.

### **About us**



We are Xomnia, the AI consulting company. We’re curious problem solvers who believe data will change the way we live, work and communicate. Being at the forefront of this revolutionary change in a sustainable, positive way is what drives us.



We solve challenging data science and engineering projects, from start to finish. From developing an application for real-time fraud detection on Google Cloud Platform, to setting up a customized recommender engine in an existing Microsoft Azure environment - we develop and deploy tailor-made data science solutions.

  


Xomnia started in 2013 in one room in the heart of Amsterdam. These days we take up nearly two houses. But more than just a workspace, we're a community that values authenticity. Here, everyone is encouraged to be themselves, to learn, and to have fun in the process.



Representing over 20 nationalities, our team values the unique cultural perspective that each individual brings to the table. Moreover, with the Dutch tech sector seeing a female representation around 11%, we are proud that over 30% of our workforce is female. Nevertheless, we recognize that there is more to be done, and we continue working to overcome barriers that still exist.

  


We encourage all candidates to apply, and we don’t discriminate based on race, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, or age. However, a reality that we face is that many of our clients prefer to communicate in Dutch, making Dutch proficiency essential for some roles. Additionally, while we wish that we could sponsor visas for everyone, there are instances when it is not feasible.

#### 
**We’re hiring a Cloud Engineer (AWS) to join the Smart Sorting Platform Team!**

###### **Description**


Prime Vision’s Intelligence department is the backbone of most systems delivered to our customers. By handling sorting center and equipment definitions, orchestrating coding flows, executing and retrieving OCR requests, and communicating with customer backend systems locally and in the cloud, the Intelligence department has first-hand production experience in the postal and parcel domain. With the most experienced software engineers in the company, our sorting system helps our customers simplify and centralize their sorting process while guaranteeing high throughput in the cloud. We need a talented engineer passionate about evolving cloud technologies who can pick up AWS skills and backend TypeScript programming to join our team and drive our mission-critical platform forward.

###### **Your job**


As a Cloud Engineer (AWS) Engineer, you will be pivotal in making our AWS setup reliable, repeatable, and highly performant. You will be designing and implementing observability practices to increase fault tolerance in a distributed system, and you will learn to address millions of requests in a Serverless Lambda architecture. You will collaborate closely with the Smart Data Manager to implement efficient business rules. Further, you will discuss with the Smart Analytics team how to make sense of the data post-sorting. The Smart Sorting Platform you will help professionalize is the workhorse that must respond with correct sorting decisions within milliseconds, allowing Prime Vision to then digest the data for analysis and come up with more optimized logistical processes at national scales.

**Specific Responsibilities**:

* Design and implement serverless applications using AWS services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, EFS, and S3. We will later make the system cloud-agnostic.
* Develop and integrate advanced logic into our sorting processes to improve efficiency and accuracy.
* Build unit and integration tests for added logic that you build.
* Build and update CDK stacks for parts of the platform for testing and deployment purposes.
* Optimize and enhance existing sorting flows to ensure robustness and high performance.
* Ensure best practices in security, performance, and reliability are followed throughout the development process.
* Troubleshoot and resolve API-related issues promptly.
* Document designs, processes, and procedures to support ongoing development and maintenance.

**What we offer**


We offer a full-time position in an informal and professional working environment with a lot of room for personal development and many extras:

* First-hand access to customer challenges and a real possibility to positively impact them in their sorting processes.
* A product development team with a pivotal position within the department, with an overseeing Product Owner and clear goals for 2 customers for 2024-2026.
* Opportunities to learn from the most experienced software engineers in the company.
* An open and inclusive workspace with colleagues from more than 20 different nationalities.
* A globally oriented company with an equally global client base.
* A full range of digital tools will be at your disposal.
* Competitive salary.
* Company laptop and mobile phone of choice.
* Extra perks such as snacks and excellent coffee every day in our cozy Grand Café.
* Training sessions by a personal trainer in our in-house gym.
* The possibility to work flexible hours.
* A profit-sharing scheme for all employees.
* The option to purchase additional vacation days on top of the 25 standard holiday allowance.

###### **Your profile**

* Proven experience as Cloud Engineer in any cloud provider. Experience with AWS and Serverless technologies is a big plus (Lambda, DynamocDB, EFS, S3, EventBridge, Kinesis, etc).
* Familiarity and expertise in event-driven architectures. Experience with SNS is a plus.
* Strong programming skills in TypeScript for backend systems. If not previous experience, the candidate should have experience with JavaScript or Python. Experience with NoSQL databases is a plus.
* Familiarity/willingness to learn CDK for deployment and infrastructure scripts.
* Familiarity with other cloud platforms (Azure, GCP) is a plus.

###### **Nice to have qualifications:**

* Knowledge of CICD best practices applicable to enterprises (DTAP environments, automatic quality gates, etc).

###### **Particularities**


In the context of corporate responsibility, Prime Vision as a company is particularly open to applications from people with a disability.

###### **Convinced this job fits you?**


If you are excited about making an already fast AWS platform even faster and want to develop yourself in the cloud and logistics domain, we would love to receive your resume and motivation letter or -video!


The application process will consist of 2 interviews and a Big Five personality test. We look forward to hearing from you.

-------------------


  
Binnen het Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM) ontwikkelt de Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) zich tot een sterke crisisorganisatie. Bij de LFI werk je nauw samen met ketenpartners binnen en buiten het RIVM in een politiek-bestuurlijke context. Een uitdagende functie waarin jij jouw flexibiliteit, wendbaarheid en talent om snel tot oplossingen te komen optimaal kunt inzetten. Als toegewijde Data Scientist die data-uitdagingen met passie omarmt en het maatschappelijk belang vooropstelt, die waardevolle inzichten levert door gebruik te maken van geavanceerde analysetechnieken en machine learning-algoritmen, waarbij je doelgericht modellen ontwikkelt, kun jij het verschil maken.

**Wat ga je doen**


De Data Scientists maken deel uit van het LFI datalab van het RIVM. LFI Datalab focust op het verzamelen en visualiseren van kerncijfers en KPI’s over de medisch-operationele processen voor de LFI. Deze cijfers bieden handvatten voor de LFI om de operatie, voor en tijdens een landelijke pandemie, nauwgezet te kunnen volgen. Daarnaast dienen de cijfers ter verantwoording ten tijde van A-infectieziekten die vragen om een landelijke aanpak. De cijfers zijn specifiek gericht op het ondersteunen van de LFI bij de regie op de medisch-operationele processen. Daarnaast ben je in de hele RIVM-organisatie aanwezig en kom je in aanraking met verschillende disciplines, zoals o.a. LFI operationele teams, RIVM Informatievoorziening, Stakeholders van VWS, GGD’en en RIVM. Je wordt van alle kanten bevraagd en bent betrokken bij veel projecten en programma’s.

**Een greep uit je taken en werkzaamheden:**


je bent verantwoordelijk voor het opstellen van duidelijke projectplannen en houdt nauwlettend toezicht op de voortgang ervan.


het automatiseren van informatie en het identificeren van patronen en trends behoren tot jouw taken, waarbij je waardevolle inzichten levert voor strategische- en tactische besluitvorming;


het integreren van data, processen en technologieën binnen en buiten de organisatie om bedrijfsprocessen te verbeteren en doelen te bereiken, is een van je prioriteiten;


je neemt actief deel aan verschillende projecten en processen, gericht op het verzamelen van informatie ter ondersteuning van de taken van de LFI;


het gebruik van geavanceerde analytische technieken en programmeertalen zoals Python, R en SQL om grote datasets te manipuleren en voorspellende modellen te ontwikkelen voor data-gedreven besluitvorming, is jouw expertise. Een voorbeeld is de IPC (van Diagnostiek en Behandelen) Integrale Plannings- en Capaciteit tool dat met behulp van Big Data, AI, modelleren en optimaliseren, prognoses, complexe data, machine learning optimaal voorbereid is op verschillende scenario's.


jij bent essentieel bij het implementeren van onze datalabfunctie, waarbij je op tactisch niveau meedenkt over de visie en daarnaast procesbeschrijvingen en werkwijzen vormgeeft;


met effectief stakeholdermanagement op diverse niveaus werk je samen met de business om de juiste functionele vragen te definiëren en geschikte datasets te identificeren, terwijl je nauw samenwerkt met technische experts;

**Waar staat de LFI voor?**


De Landelijke Functie Opschaling Infectieziektebestrijding (LFI) is een nieuw organisatieonderdeel van het RIVM. Het is de missie van de LFI om samen met haar ketenpartners de impact van de volgende pandemie op de volksgezondheid zo klein mogelijk te houden. Bij een infectieziektecrisis die een landelijke aanpak vereist, zorgt de LFI voor snelle opschaling en centrale aansturing van de medisch-operationele processen bij de GGD’en, zoals testen en vaccineren.


Om samen met de ketenpartners goed voorbereid te zijn, voert de LFI regie op onder andere het opleiden, trainen en oefenen van medewerkers en het maken van afspraken over informatievoorziening en snelle beschikbaarheid van grote aantallen medewerkers. Door de sterke verbinding met de GGD’en en het Centrum Infectieziektebestrijding (CIb) van het RIVM, kan de LFI snel opschalen bij een infectieziektecrisis.


De implementatie van de LFI is eind 2023 gestart en is naar verwachting eind 2026 voltooid. In deze periode geeft de LFI samen met GGD’en, andere onderdelen van het RIVM en het ministerie van VWS concrete invulling aan de ontwerpen voor onder andere aansturing, opgeschaalde diagnostiek en behandelen, grootschalig klantcontact, logistiek, scenario-ontwerp, crisiscommunicatie, informatiemanagement, inkoop, facilitaire diensten en financiën.

Ons doel: een gezonde bevolking en een duurzame, veilige en gezonde leefomgeving. We bewaken gezondheid, ziekten, de kwaliteit van de leefomgeving én het milieu. Daarvoor doen we onderzoek en we verzamelen kennis voor toegankelijke informatie en toepasbare adviezen. Het RIVM zorgt voor een goede geboortescreening, het bestrijden van infectieziekten en heeft een centrale rol bij het Rijksvaccinatieprogramma en de bevolkingsonderzoeken. We onderzoeken wat er nodig is voor goede zorg, een gezonde leefstijl, veilige producten en een veilige en gezonde leefomgeving. Ook dragen we bij aan het voorkomen, bestrijden en beheersen van incidenten en crises.



Vanuit ons hoofdkantoor in Bilthoven en vanaf 2025 vanuit een prachtig nieuw gebouw op het Utrecht Science Park, werken we met ongeveer 2500 collega’s aan al onze adviezen, rapporten, factsheets en publicaties. Daarbij laten we ons leiden door de vragen van vandaag én morgen. We doen ons werk midden in de maatschappij. Trots zijn we op onze organisatie waar iedereen welkom is. Als kennisinstituut van de overheid willen we een afspiegeling van de samenleving zijn. Naast talent, ervaring en motivatie maken ook aspecten van identiteit zoals leeftijd, geaardheid, culturele achtergrond of arbeidsbeperking, onze organisatie rijker, innovatiever én leuker. Met deze verschillende achtergronden, perspectieven en inzichten werken wij samen aan een nog beter resultaat!

**De functie**
--------------


In de functie van data scientist werk je voor de directie Financiën en Inkoop. Het leuke daarvan: dit gaat niet alleen om euro’s, maar ook om wat we daarmee precies doen. En dat is veel! Dankzij de producten uit jouw team hebben managers en hun adviseurs beter zicht op budget en uitgaven. De directie heeft beter zicht op de efficiency van werkprocessen. En het gemeentelijk directieteam kan beter sturen op geld en waarde.



Wat jouw rol precies inhoudt? Als data scientist ontwikkel en implementeer je data- en (generatieve) AI-oplossingen. Dat doe je samen met de collega’s binnen een datateam van data scientists, cloud engineers en BI specialisten, maar ook met collega’s die deze oplossingen gaan gebruiken. Je krijgt er dus direct een groot Amsterdams netwerk bij en werkt praktisch en creatief samen. Je bent daarnaast onderzoekend en vindt het leuk om te experimenteren met nieuwe technieken. Je reflecteert op je werk en je stimuleert collega’s om er samen alles uit te halen wat erin zit.


Dit doe je op een gemiddelde dag
--------------------------------

* Je werkt volgens een Agile Scrum methode en start daarom je dag met een standup. Je bespreekt met je collega’s in het scrum-team welke stories je gaat oppakken.
* Na een kop koffie ga je aan de slag, individueel dan wel samen, met het incrementeel produceren van een data- en AI-oplossing.
* Voordat je aan de lunch commit, test je jouw code en review je een pull-request van je collega.
* 's Middags staan er wat calls op het programma met je directe collega-ontwikkelaars of andere stakeholders om te zorgen dat iedereen op één lijn zit.
* Je houdt je ogen open voor de nieuwste trends die onze digitale overheid kunnen versterken en denkt na over hoe je die kunt toepassen binnen het financiële domein.
* Je eindigt je dag met het bijwerken van de Jira-omgeving en een gezamenlijk sportmoment als je op locatie werkt.


Hier ga je aan de slag
----------------------

We willen een goede werkgever zijn die ervoor zorgt dat alle collega’s zich gezien en gewaardeerd voelen. We koesteren verschillen tussen collega’s, al die verschillen zorgen voor betere resultaten voor onze organisatie én onze stad. We streven daarbij naar een personeelsbestand dat een afspiegeling is van de beroepsbevolking van Amsterdam. Dus wie jij ook bent: bij ons ben je van harte welkom!


Sluit je aan bij ons team Data, Rapportages & Innovatie, waar talentvolle nieuwkomers samen met ervaren experts Amsterdam vooruithelpen. We zijn een sociaal en divers team dat buiten werktijd graag samenkomt voor een drankje of een sportieve uitdaging. Maar laad jij liever op door op tijd naar huis te gaan? Ook helemaal prima. Bij ons draait het om samenwerken, plezier en de ruimte nemen om onze successen en het werk dat we doen te waarderen. Lijkt het jou wat om samen met ons inventieve oplossingen te bedenken die de gemeente helpen om verstandige financiële keuzes te maken? Dan is dit jouw plek.


Dit breng je mee
----------------

Voor de functie data scientist beschik je over:

* WO-denkniveau met een relevante opleiding in het vakgebied data science of AI.
* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring met het ontwikkelen en implementeren van data science en AI oplossingen in een complexe dataomgeving met behulp van Python en SQL.
* Hands-on ervaring met data science-tools in een cloud omgeving.
* Ervaring met het werken met DevOps en DataBricks in een Azure omgeving is een plus.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum methodiek en een versiebeheerplatform zoals Git.
* Bij voorkeur ervaring in het financiële domein of sterke affiniteit hiermee.


Aan competenties breng je mee:

* Inventiviteit. Je bedenkt verschillende, soms originele ideeën en oplossingen.
* Omgevingsbewustzijn. Je blijft goed op de hoogte van vakinhoudelijke, organisatorische, maatschappelijke, politieke ontwikkelingen of andere omgevingsfactoren en weet deze effectief te benutten.
* Sterke communicatieve vaardigheden om met diverse doelgroepen in gesprek te gaan (denk aan technici, dataspecialisten, financieel specialisten, managers en adviseurs).
* Resultaatgerichtheid. Je spant je in om concrete doelen te behalen en houdt vast totdat je het resultaat bereikt hebt.


Dit bieden we jou
-----------------

Als Data Scientist kom je ons maximaal 36 uur per week versterken en kun je rekenen op onderstaande arbeidsvoorwaarden.

* Een bruto maandsalaris van € 4.264,- tot € 6.072,- (schaal 11) op basis van een 36-urige werkweek. Het exacte salaris wordt afgestemd op de opleiding, kennis en ervaring die je meebrengt.
* Een arbeidsovereenkomst voor de duur van 1 jaar, met daarna de mogelijkheid op een overeenkomst voor onbepaalde tijd indien je op dit moment nog geen, of een tijdelijke, arbeidsovereenkomst hebt bij Gemeente Amsterdam.
* Ontwikkel- en opleidingsmogelijkheden. Ons interne opleidingscentrum, de Amsterdamse School, biedt verschillende opleidingen, ontwikkeltrajecten en begeleiding in het werk waardoor je jezelf kan blijven uitdagen.
* Een individueel keuzebudget (IKB) van 17,05% van jouw salaris dat je kunt gebruiken voor bijvoorbeeld extra pensioenopbouw of extra verlofdagen.
* Een pensioenregeling bij ABP, het pensioenfonds voor overheid en onderwijs.

* Hybride werken: in deze functie kun je deels thuis en deels op kantoor werken. We bieden (thuis)werkmiddelen aan om je werkplek veilig en gezond in te richten.

Gezamenlijk zetten onze ruim 2.000 professionals zich dagelijks in voor ruim 65.000 werkgevers en ruim 1,5 miljoen werkenden om gezond, gemotiveerd en competent aan het werk te zijn en blijven. En dat levert een schat aan data op waar wij ons als afdeling Research & Development graag in vastbijten en deze vertalen in vernieuwende inzichten en datagedreven innovaties met inzet van AI.**



**Hoe ga je #meerbetekenen als Data Scientist**
-----------------------------------------------


Als Data Scientist bij HumanTotalCare denk je iedere dag vanuit jouw kennis en kunde mee over manieren waarop onze organisatie en professionals met behulp van data effectiever kunnen werken, en hoe we meer kunnen betekenen voor werknemers en werkgevers. Nu en straks.


Samen met je R&D collega’s en andere professionals uit de hele organisatie ontwikkel je concepten en ideeën die, via een innovatieproces met experimenten en pilots, tot schaalbare oplossingen voor de collega’s en klanten leiden. Dit doe je niet alleen en van achter je bureau, maar samen met je directe collega’s en in dialoog met de business.


Wij zijn er om in de praktijk belangrijk te zijn, en zetten hiervoor data en technologie samen met onze domeinkennis in. Denk aan het ontwikkelen van modellen voor beslisondersteuning in het verzuimproces, waarmee we het verschil maken door de juiste interventie op het juiste moment te initiëren. Of aan een datagedreven preventieproces waardoor een diagnose of prognose sneller gesteld kan worden en preventieve acties gerichter kunnen worden geadviseerd. Maar ook aan inzet van AI op de werkplek waarmee we onze professionals kunnen ondersteunen met efficiënte werkprocessen. We willen onze toegevoegde waarde meetbaar maken en monitoren onze KPI’s. Zo blijven we samen leren om onze processen en diensten te verbeteren.  



**Met wie ga je #meerbetekenen**
--------------------------------


Je wordt onderdeel van het veelzijdige R&D team, bestaande uit ongeveer 15 vaste collega’s. Met een mooie mix van consultants, research & business development, data scientists, project support medewerkers en machine learning engineers, aangevuld met een flexibele schil van onderzoeksassistenten, studenten en scientist practitioners ga jij impact maken.


Met een grote diversiteit aan kennis en kunde brengen wij data, wetenschap, technologie en praktijk bij elkaar. Dit doen we in nauwe samenwerking met collega’s van Business Intelligence, staf en IT. De organisatie weet ons goed te vinden en we hebben toegang tot een breed scala aan expertise van onze arbo-professionals. Van bedrijfsartsen tot arbeids- en organisatiedeskundigen en van ergonomen tot psychologen.



### **Wat is écht leuk aan deze baan**

* We hebben een schatkist vol relevante data. Van procesdata, verzuimdata, vragenlijsten tot vrije tekst of gebruik van onze platformen. Over onze dienstverlening heen, zowel inhoudelijke data rondom gezondheid van werknemers als procesinformatie en KPI’s (bijv. klanttevredenheid, omzet). Er is nog genoeg te ontginnen en veel ruimte voor jouw ideeën. Uiteraard binnen de kaders van de wet, privacy staat hoog bij ons in het vaandel.
* Jouw werk maakt echt verschil voor werkend Nederland. Wat je bedenkt kan ook echt in productie worden gebracht. Daarbij is er veel draagvlak binnen de organisatie voor wat je doet.
* Je wordt onderdeel van een hecht team, en elke dinsdag neem je deel aan de R&D dag met updates, demo’s of innovatiesessies.
* Je bepaalt voor een groot deel zelf waar je jouw energie in steekt en de meeste toegevoegde waarde ziet. Je krijgt veel autonomie om je werk in te richten zoals jij dat wilt. Zo vormt de functie zich naar jouw expertise en ambitie.

### **Is er ook iets minder leuk**


Het vakgebied is volop in ontwikkeling. Soms willen we te snel of moeten we eerst de data nog ontsluiten. Het is niet altijd een gespreid bedje en je bent nog aan het bouwen van jouw positie als Data Scientist binnen de organisatie. Maar met een flinke dosis doorzettingskracht en een goed verhaal kom je echt al een heel eind.



**Wat neem je mee**
-------------------


Nieuwsgierigheid en een beetje vakidiotie. Jij bent op de hoogte van de laatste inhoudelijke en technologische ontwikkelingen. En komt er weer wat interessants voorbij, dan maak jij je dit snel eigen. Je experimenteert met de mogelijke toepassing(en) hiervan. Je snapt de interactie tussen hardware en software en bedenkt graag dingen die echt een bijdrage leveren aan de praktijk. Daarbij heb je affiniteit met ons vakgebied van o.a. werk, gezondheid en gedragsverandering. En je weet hoe je jouw boodschap over de bühne moet krijgen. Complexe materie kun je uitleggen in de taal van je gesprekspartner, waar deze zich ook in de organisatie bevindt.


Verder vragen we het volgende:

* Een relevante universitaire opleiding (data/computer science of statistiek en methoden).
* Bij voorkeur minimaal 5 jaren relevante werkervaring als Data analist of Data Scientist en je hebt eerder gewerkt met grote hoeveelheden data, inclusief data cleaning.
* Je bent goed thuis in statistiek en onderzoeksmethoden.
* Je kunt uitstekend uit de voeten met Python, en liefst ook met een andere programmeertaal zoals R of Java.
* Je hebt ervaring met machine learning en bij voorkeur ook met andere data-analyse technieken, zoals simulatie, deep learning, en Natural Language Processing.
* Het is een pré als je ervaring hebt met infrastructuur en softwarearchitectuur die nodig zijn om modellen in softwareproductie te kunnen integreren (bijv. Docker, Kubernetes, microservices en REST API’s).
* De werkzaamheden en de documentatie zijn grotendeels in het Engels. Omdat je data vertaalt naar de business in onze organisatie, is het van belang dat je voldoende Nederlands spreekt en schrijft (B2).

**Wat krijg je ervoor terug**
-----------------------------


Als HumanTotalCare zetten we ons in voor een gezond, gemotiveerd en competent werkend Nederland. Vanuit onze merken adviseren en ondersteunen we werkgevers en werkenden gedurende hun hele werkzame leven. Zo zijn we van betekenis voor werkenden, organisaties en onze maatschappij. En wat we naar buiten beloven, doen we ook intern. We bieden je dan ook:

* **Een open, informele werksfeer.** We doen het voor, door en met elkaar.
* De mogelijkheid om **hybride te werken**, waarbij we er graag voor zorgen dat jouw thuiswerkplek ergonomisch helemaal op orde is. Er is veel aandacht en ruimte voor een **gezonde work-life balance**.
* Daarnaast ben je altijd welkom in ons **kantoor** in Utrecht of in Son. Op beide locaties werken de R&D’ers samen en drinken graag een kop koffie met elkaar. Dinsdag is onze vaste kantoordag.
* **Een warme introductie in onze organisatie** **en de afdeling**. Vanuit R&D hebben we een uitgebreid inwerkprogramma samengesteld waarin je het team leert kennen en meeloopt met verschillende collega’s binnen en buiten de afdeling.
* Een salaris tussen de € 4.600 – € 6.500, we kijken bij inschaling naar de kennis en ervaring die je meebrengt. En daarnaast een goede pensioenregeling en 25 vakantiedagen (met de mogelijkheid om bij te kopen). Plus een laptop, mobiele telefoon en reiskostenvergoeding.
* Direct een **vast contract**.
* Alle aandacht voor preventie en vitaliteit. We zijn trots op ons vitaliteits- en ontwikkelprogramma.
* **Gezellige evenementen en borrels**, zowel met de afdeling als met de hele organisatie, omdat we informele contacten met collega’s ook heel belangrijk vinden.

If so, consider applying for the Junior Data Scientist position at IG&H!**

  

As a Data Scientist, you will play a crucial role in helping our clients derive valuable and new insights from large and complex datasets. You start doing this by creating deep understanding of the challenges our clients are facing. Together with your team, you’ll then determine how to create most business value for our clients. Afterward, you’ll apply your knowledge and skills on data modelling in a practical setting. Methods we use range from more basic data processing techniques to machine learning and large language models. Finally, you communicate and present results convincingly, to create real and lasting impact. We believe that those who can combine analytical skills with business sense are most successful in creating this impact for our clients.

  

IG&H is active in three sectors (retail, financial services and health), allowing you to get experience on a variety of projects. On top, you'll be working closely with IG&H consultants outside of the Data & Analytics team too, such that you learn much more than only data related skills. Especially if you start your career at IG&H, this will help you in understanding what you really like doing and want to learn.  



  

Next to excellent employment conditions, working at IG&H will be a great place to kick-start your career. We believe that a caring and fun working environment will help you to dare to step out of your comfort zone and learn. In addition, we offer continuous learning through the IG&H Academy, in which you’ll get training to boost your data science, consulting and people skills. Also, you will be assigned a mentor, who will be there for you to provide you with guidance.  



  

Above all, people are at the heart of what we do. This of course comes back in the work we deliver for our clients (why make a data product if the people who need to use it don’t understand or want to use it?). At the same time, a fun working culture is key for who we are. With an inspiring office in Utrecht where we can connect, have abundant parties, team activities and sport events (both organised for the entire IG&H organization as well as specifically for the Data & Analytics team), IG&H is truly a Great Place To Work. And yes, we are certified!  



  

  

*“In addition to on-the-job learning, you learn everything you need to know about consultancy in the IG&H Academy. The program consists of various internal and external training courses and has been specifically developed for trainees. Besides training sessions, the Academy often organizes trips and dinners. Through these, you quickly develop good relationships with co-workers at IG&H. I see many of them outside of work on a regular basis”* **Jasmijn Haverhals (Consultant Healthcare)**

  

*“The most beautiful thing about consulting is the diversity within the projects. IG&H offers next to different clients, a variety in the types of assignments. One assignment could be very strategic, in which you outline the direction of a company. Whereas another assignment could be focused on implementation, in which you are working together with the client to deliver concrete results.”* **Peter Hardy (Director)**

 **What we ask:**

  

* MSc degree in Econometrics, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence or similar field
* You have excellent Dutch and English communication skills, due to client needs
* Analytical, inventive and practical
* Python and/or R skills


**What we offer you:**

  

* Working at a Great Place To Work with a pleasant atmosphere, enthusiastic colleagues who support you and many fun activities
* Continuous development through the IG&H Academy and active on the job coaching
* Permanent (indefinite) contract right away
* Excellent salary and working benefits
* Company car / good mobility scheme
* 25 holiday days with the possibility to take up to 5 more
* Generous bonus scheme
* Possibility to take a sabbatical after 3 years of employment
* IG&H facilitates a Healthy Human programme, where you get guidance with all adjustments in life, such as having a child or being a caregiver to a sick family member
* Possibility to work parttime (32 hours), at least 4 days a week
* Great opportunity to make an active contribution to the further growth of the organization
* And more, which we would love to elaborate on


**WHY IG&H?**

  


IG&H is transforming leading companies across the Health, Retail and Finance sectors. Together with our world-class technology partners, we help our clients move forward and stay relevant.

Disability rather than early death has become an increasingly large share of the global disease burden rising from 21% in 1990 to 34% in 2019. Non-communicable diseases (NCD), including cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes, account for 71% of the annual death toll.


Primary health care that delivers patient-centered services (asynchronous) is the best way to effectively manage risk factors and uncomplicated NCD\*. An asynchronous model that empowers and engages patients in the management of their health and is built on patient selfefficacy. In such an asynchronous model, healthcare access moves from the clinic (systemcentric) into the patient's daily life and health management shifts from the clinician to the patient. Developing data-driven solutions to improve patient self-efficacy will be a core differentiator coming out of these projects.


**Job Description**

The Data Analytics group of the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS) runs several projects that deal with extramural care of patients with chronic, lifestyle related, diseases. These projects are usually part of larger (inter)national consortia where partners from different academic, medical, and industrial organizations work closely together on project goals in this context. An example of this is the European project IRHIS (see attachment). In IRHIS there is a vacancy for one PhD candidate. We are looking for a team player with a strong background in data science/engineering who is willing to collaborate in multi-disciplinary international teams.


**Short description IRHIS project**


IRHIS aims to establish the first EU-wide Advanced Remote Care Demonstration Chain. It is meant to collaboratively demonstrate and scale Advanced Remote Care Tech Champions across Less Developed Regions (LDR). IRHIS will for that purpose build 3 Interregional DemoScale Labs accelerating the upscale of advanced AI-powered MedTech across 3 of the most critical EU remote care areas: musculoskeletal rehabilitation, neurological disorder treatment, and critical patient conditions (ICU).


In practice, our consortium will demonstrate and scale 8 key technologies developed by innovative scale-up SMEs from several European countries. To ensure a user-centric approach of the development, more than 1000+ patients will be involved in testing and evaluation activities, collecting millions of big data entries.


Processing this data will enable robust AI & Machine Learning model developments to ensure market fit and adoption of the IRHIS technologies. Further, clinical relevance will be created throughout 2 years of continuous, parallel and iterative testing across the 3 DemoScale Labs backed by our 20 partners from 13 EU Regions. Our interregional leverage will thus lie in data, tech (integration), and patients.


Beyond technology deployment, our initiative seeks to consolidate the fragmented EU remote care innovation landscape, mobilizing crucial investments, fostering interoperability, and harnessing the potential of a rapidly evolving field that promises improved patient journeys, predictive rehabilitation, and transformative care solutions. IRHIS thus envisions the establishment of a dynamic EU-wide ecosystem, with a focus on empowering innovators from Less Developed Regions. We will conduct capacity building activities and grow a portfolio of innovative scale-up SMEs meant to become global leaders in their domain.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* A master’s degree (or an equivalent university degree) in Data Science, Computer Science or Electrical Engineering.
* A research-oriented attitude.
* Ability to work in an interdisciplinary international team and interested in collaborating with industrial partners.
* Motivated to develop teaching skills and to coach students.
* Fluent in spoken and written English (C1 level).

**Conditions of employment**
----------------------------


A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:


* Full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.
* Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the *Collective Labour Agreement* for Dutch Universities, scale P (min. €2,872 max. €3,670).
* A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
* High-quality training programs and other support to grow into a self-aware, autonomous scientific researcher. At TU/e we challenge you to take charge of your own learning process.
* An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
* An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
* A Staff Immigration Team and a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) for international candidates.

Title: DC2, PhD fellowship in plant-based food fermentation genomics.  

Researcher profile: Doctoral candidate.  

Research field: (Food) Microbiology, Bioinformatics, Biotechnolgy, Fermentation.  

Type of contract: Temporary.  

Job status: Full-time.  

Duration: 36 months.  

Application deadline: Sunday 01/09/2024 23:59 - Europe/Brussels.  

Envisaged job starting date: September 2024.  

How to apply: submit your application form through the FAIROmics website.


Please note that this PhD position will lead to the award of a **double diploma** from **Wageningen University and Research** in The Netherlands and the **National and Kapodistrian University of Athens** in Greece.


**Project description:**


The FAIROmics initiative, an interdisciplinary research programme, brings together universities, research centres and private companies to enable the FAIRification of omics data and databases interoperability. Furthermore, knowledge graphs for data-driven decision-making will be developed to rationally design microbial communities that provide plant-based fermented foods with desirable characteristics in the context of open science and its regulations. The FAIROmics training programme aims to develop doctoral candidates’ skills at the interface between artificial intelligence, life sciences, humanities, and social sciences.


**Scientific context:**


Plant-based dairy and meat alternatives have grown in popularity in recent years for various reasons, including sustainability and health benefits, as well as lifestyle trends and dietary restrictions. However, plant-based food products can be nutritionally unbalanced, and their flavour profiles may limit their acceptance by consumers. Microorganisms have been used in making food products for millennia. However, the diversity of microbial communities driving plant-based fermentations, as well as their key genetic and phenotypic traits and potential synergies among community members, remain poorly characterised. Many data exist, but they are spread across scientific literature or, in the best case, in different databases. Data are not always reusable because they are difficult to find and access and because databases are not systematically interoperable.


**Objectives:**


We are looking for a Doctoral Candidate (DC) to join our project at multiple sites in Europe with a master’s degree in **(Food) Microbiology / Bioinformatics / Biotechnology** who is interested in new concepts for **developing safe innovative plant-based fermented foods based on genome mining of starter bacteria.**


The main objective of this research project is to rationally design mixed bacterial cultures to ferment plant protein-based ingredients with desirable outcomes. This will be based on predictions derived from available data sets on individual lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains (with available sequenced genomes) and favourable fermentation outcomes upon growth on different plant-based substrates. Strain capabilities relevant to the preservation and safety of plant-based products will be determined. The performance of mixed cultures to ferment plant-protein-based ingredients regarding the formation of favourable flavour compounds, removal of unwanted chemical contaminants (e.g. off-flavours, mycotoxins), and acid formation and preservation effect (suppressing the growth of spoilers and pathogens) will be verified. Linking of functional properties of strains and genomic traits with fermentation outcomes will support the design of novel fermented foods.


The project is expected to generate a model to predict outcomes of different plant protein-based fermentations using mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria with respect to flavour formation, removal of unwanted compounds, and preservation capacity. This allows for steering relevant fermentation outcomes based on key gene functions and fermentative capacity of LAB strains on different plant-based substrates.


**Location and planned secondments:**


The position is based at **NIZO** in **The Netherlands** with close collaboration with **Wageningen University.**


Secondments will take place:


**National and Kapodistrian University of Athens**, 8 months: metabolomics analyses of metabolites in plant matrices upon fermentation.  

**University of Reading**, 3 months: physiological evaluation of key gene expression in selected lactic acid bacteria.


**Enrolment in Doctoral degree:**


1st-degree awarding organisation: Wageningen University, Wageningen, Netherlands, https://www.wur.nl/en/wageningen-university.htm


2nd-degree awarding organisation: National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece, https://en.uoa.gr/

Parent-infant physical closeness (PIPC) sharply decreases over the first months in Western families, while studies show that PIPC is important for healthy child development and potentially also for maternal wellbeing. PIPC may hence offer unique opportunities to support both child development and new parents’ wellbeing. However, large gaps in knowledge on fathers, causal associations, underlying mechanisms, and long-term relations preclude further developments. Will you help us with further research?***  

  

This 4-year project is financed by NWO and focused on early parenthood and infancy and will be lead by Prof Dr. Carolina de Weerth (Developmental Psychobiology Lab).  

  

Our multidisciplinary team will fill these gaps with sophisticated intervention, experimental, and longitudinal studies on daily life PIPC: baby carrying, skin-to-skin contact, and room sharing. We will determine whether, to what extent, and through what mechanisms easily accessible avenues for increasing PIPC can lead to improved maternal, paternal, and child mental and physical health, both concurrently as well as later in childhood and adolescence.  

  

The project includes collaborators from Erasmus University Rotterdam, Utrecht University, and University of Trento. You will be part of a team consisting of senior researchers, a PhD student, a student assistant, as well as perinatal professionals and parents. You will be affiliated to the Donders Institute for Brain Cognition and Behaviour and the Baby & Child Research Center.  

  

We offer a challenging position in an innovative project within a team of dedicated colleagues. Our collaboration is characterized by creativity, collegiality, team work, and responsibility. You will be part of a dynamic, enthusiastic, collaborative, and ambitious research group specialized in early life, the developmental psychobiology lab.  

  

**Tasks and responsibilities*** Developing and pre-registering research protocols.
* Preparing and submitting (medical) ethical applications.
* Support recruitment and data collection.
* Data analysis and statistical analyses.
* Writing and dissemination of results for peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals.
* Writing and dissemination of results for the public, professionals, internal reports, etc.
* Presentation of findings at conferences and symposia.
* Training and supervision of PhD and (Research) Master students, as well as research assistants.

Plants respond to insect attack by mobilizing defences that specifically target the current attacker. How this response limits or provides opportunities to deal with future attack and how plants account for future risks will be the focus of your research. Your task is to mine genomic data to reveal phylogenomic patterns in signaling pathways underlying defence responses against insect herbivores within diverse plant species of the Brassicaceae family. Your project seeks to link ecological interactions with molecular defence mechanisms through comparative genomics by focusing on gene presence-absence variations, copy number changes, and visualizing synteny and structural rearrangements across multiple genomes. In addition, you have the opportunity to measure transcriptomic responses of various Brassicaceae plants to attack by multiple insect herbivores, quantify resistance to these herbivores and may delve into causality of genes in defence plasticity by creating knockout plants.  

  

You will directly collaborate with fellow PhDs, post-docs and technicians. The team aims to link plant physiological adaptations to attack by multiple herbivores in a plant phylogenomic context (your work) to plant growth-defence strategies and plant-insect interaction patterns in the field.

Job description


Autonomous vehicles have been shown to underperform when deployed on conditions that differ substantially from the training conditions, so-called domain gaps. These domain gaps can include deployment in different regions, weather or using different sensors. Numerous domain adaptation methods have been proposed to bridge these domain gaps and let the model operate well on the target data. In this project we seek to find an intermediate representation for data coming from varied sources. By bringing new data into this representation, we overcome domain gaps and are able to train models that are robust to different conditions, also referred to as foundation models. While foundation models have achieved widespread success on images and text, currently none exist for radar data, making this a promising research direction. These foundation models will bring superior performance and allow us to utilize data from varied sources, thus reducing the data collection and labeling costs.



The Intelligent Vehicles section at TU Delft, the Netherlands, invites applications for a fully funded two-year (up to 30 months) Post-Doctoral research position in the area of foundation models for autonomous vehicles. This position is part of the EU Horizon project Cynergie4MIE and in collaboration with the chip company NXP. While the exact task (detection, segmentation) is flexible, it should make use of radar sensors, potentially fused with other sensors. Your results will be published in top tier conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICRA and NeurIPS. For your work you will have access to the compute resources of TU Delft, ranging from personal machines, to shared GPU servers, the Delft AI Cluster that is shared across departments, as well as DelftBlue, which is one of the top 250 supercomputers in the world. Your main supervisor will be Dr. Holger Caesar, creator of the nuScenes dataset and co-author of the PointPillars method for lidar-based object detection. You will receive hands-on mentoring for your career development and help with applying for future research grants, to kick-start your continued academic career.


Requirements


* We are seeking Post-Doc applicants with an interest in performing cutting edge research in an active and exciting research area.
* Prospective applicants should have a strong academic record with a solid background in sensor processing (vision/radar/lidar, sensor fusion) and Machine Learning (Deep Learning, domain adaptation, foundation models).
* Good programming skills (Python/Matlab) and knowledge of deep-learning frameworks (TensorFlow/PyTorch) are expected.
* A certain affinity towards turning complex concepts into real-world practice (i.e. vehicle demonstrator) is desired.
* The successful candidate is expected to be able to act independently as well as to collaborate effectively with members of a larger team and supervise Master and PhD students. Good English skills are required.


Conditions of employment


Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.



From 1 September next, a salary increase of 3.7% applies due to a Collective Agreement amendment, followed by an additional 1% increase on 1 January 2025. In addition, most employees employed on 1 September 2024 will receive a one-off payment of €300 gross based on full-time employment.



For international applicants, TU Delft has the Coming to Delft Service. This service provides information for new international employees to help you prepare the relocation and to settle in the Netherlands. The Coming to Delft Service offers a Dual Career Programme for partners and they organise events to expand your (social) network.

Job description


Autonomous vehicles have come a long way from initial public testing with safety drivers to fully driverless deployments in multiple cities across the world. However, to further improve these vehicles, they need to be trained from ever growing data sources collected by their fleets. Due to the vast cost of storing and processing this data, car manufacturers face the problem that they can only store a fraction of it (storing 1h of data costs about $5000 per year). Therefore new paradigms are needed to reduce the storage and processing cost.



Federated learning is such a novel paradigm that revolutionizes how Machine Learning systems are trained. Rather than storing all data on a central server and training there, federated learning allows us to learn in a distributed way. In the case of autonomous vehicles, this means that every vehicle can perform training steps while the system is idle, thereby saving energy and bandwidth. Furthermore, federated learning is much less privacy-sensitive, since sensor data of faces does not need to be transferred to the cloud.



The Intelligent Vehicles section at TU Delft, the Netherlands, invites applications for a fully funded two-year (up to 30 months) Post-Doctoral research position in the area of federated learning for autonomous vehicles. This position is part of the EU Horizon project Cynergie4MIE and in collaboration with the chip company NXP. You will be one of the first to train modern perception and/or prediction (a.k.a. motion forecasting) algorithms in a federated learning setup and provide an analysis of the pros and cons of this approach. While the exact task (detection, segmentation, prediction) is flexible, it should make use of radar sensors, potentially fused with other sensors. Your results will be published in top tier conferences like CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICRA and NeurIPS. For your work you will have access to the compute resources of TU Delft, ranging from personal machines, to shared GPU servers, the Delft AI Cluster that is shared across departments, as well as DelftBlue, which is one of the top 250 supercomputers in the world.

-------------------

**Research group**


At the Chemical Process Intensification group, we focus on making chemical processes smarter, smaller and more efficient. We work based on two main pillars; experiments and numerical modelling. The numerical models typically give us insight in the relevant physical phenomena, whereas experiments can serve for validation and verification of the models, as well as for concept demonstration purposes. We operate in various fields, e.g. Direct Air Capture, Bubbly Flows, Fluidized Bed Technology, Metal Fuels, Electrification, etc, with 10-15 researchers.


**Background**


The global energy landscape is undergoing a significant shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources such as solar and wind. However, the intermittent nature of these renewable energy sources necessitates the development of efficient energy storage solutions. Iron powder presents a promising alternative for high-density energy storage, offering the ability to store energy and release it as heat on demand. A key challenge in making this process viable at an industrial scale is the carbon-neutral reduction of iron oxides back into iron using green hydrogen. In the CIRCL project, we aim to address this challenge by developing and scaling up a fluidized bed process that efficiently reduces iron oxides while maintaining the necessary powder properties.


**Job description**


We are seeking a highly motivated and talented PhD candidate to join our research team at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). The candidate will contribute to advancing the understanding of high-temperature fluidization in the context of iron powder energy storage. Specifically, the research will focus on the hydrodynamics of fluidized beds operating at high temperatures and in the presence of hydrogen gas. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work with a unique experimental setup that allows for high-resolution optical access to a pseudo-2D fluidized bed, operating at temperatures up to 800 °C.  

Additionally, we seek to develop a new theoretical framework to describe fluidization under these extreme conditions, considering factors such as inter-particle forces, van der Waals interactions, and electrostatic effects. For this purpose, CFD-DEM modelling (discrete particle modelling) will be used, based on a model that is already present in our group, but which requires expansion and validation for the purposes of this study.


This PhD position is a collaboration with other members of our research group as well as members of the Power and Flow group at the Mechanical Engineering faculty. Moreover, we closely work together with industrial users of the metal fuels technology.


Researchers of our group participate in various courses related to their field of work, take part in national and international conferences and congresses, and report to the project user committee throughout the PhD contract. Besides the project described above, a small part of your time will be tasked with assisting with chemical engineering education duties.


**Job requirements**
--------------------


We are looking for talented, motivated and enthusiastic MSc or engineer with a background in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering or applied physics. A strong background in fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, and/or particle technology is essential. The ideal candidate also has demonstrated proficiency in numerical modelling, particularly Discrete Element Models (DEM). You should be comfortable to work or learn to work with experimental setups and data analysis. Strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and the ability to work collaboratively in a multidisciplinary team are required. Strong communication skills in English, both written and verbal, are essential.

-------------------

**Research group**


At the Chemical Process Intensification group, we focus on making chemical processes smarter, smaller and more efficient. We work based on two main pillars; experiments and numerical modelling. The numerical models typically give us insight in the relevant physical phenomena, whereas experiments can serve for validation and verification of the models, as well as for concept demonstration purposes. We operate in various fields, e.g. Direct Air Capture, Bubbly Flows, Fluidized Bed Technology, Electrification, etc, with 10-15 researchers.


**Background**


Cake formation in fluidized beds refers to the build-up of a dense, often cohesive layer of particles, typically on surfaces such as the walls of fluidized bed reactors, or within the bed itself. This phenomenon can significantly affect the efficiency and operation of fluidized bed systems (e.g. reducing heat transfer efficiency, changing the hydrodynamics), which are commonly used in industries like chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, and polymer manufacturing. We seek to understand the mechanism, and want to understand the role and effect of anti-fouling agents as a prevention measure.


**Job description**


We are seeking a talented and highly motivated PhD Candidate to join our team in studying the impact of anti-fouling agents on the cake-formation process in polymer fluidization. The successful candidate will conduct experimental research using advanced fluidized bed reactor setups (e.g. high-temperature fluidization, characterization of triboelectrification), and develop predictive models to relate key parameters to the fouling behaviour. Discrete particle modelling will be performed to understand the details of electrostatics generation and transport through particle interactions. This position offers the opportunity to contribute to innovative solutions for fouling remediation in industrial applications.


The PhD position has a focus on multi-physics modelling for multiphase systems. The PhD position is part of a DPI project with industrial partners, and will work closely together with a postdoc researcher on the same project.


Researchers of our group participate in various courses related to their field of work, take part in national and international conferences and congresses, and report to the project sponsoring consortium throughout the PhD contract. Besides the project described above, a small part of your time will be tasked with assisting with chemical engineering education duties.


**Job requirements**
--------------------


We are looking for talented, motivated and enthusiastic MSc or engineer with a background in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering or applied physics. Experience with or affinity with least multiphase systems, in particular fluidization technology, is essential. The ideal candidate also has demonstrated proficiency in numerical modeling, particularly Discrete Element Models (DEM), and a solid understanding of electrostatic interactions in fluidized systems. Strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and the ability to work collaboratively in a multidisciplinary team are required. Experience with experimental setups and data analysis for heat transfer and hydrodynamics in fluidized beds will be highly valued.


We’re searching for an excellent candidate with proven capabilities who recently finished his/her master (MSc) or will obtain his/her MSc soon. Knowledge, experience and an affinity with electrochemistry are appreciated. Moreover, excellent communication skills in English are vital.

Job description


Economic resources (e.g. wealth and income) are distributed unevenly among people and in space: within cities and between cities, people and resources are concentrated and segregated. Economic inequality and urban segregation are considered top priority challenges by the United Nations. Tackling them is urgent because economic inequality and urban segregation restrict the ability of the poorest individuals to get by in life, but they also affect life expectancy, social justice and cohesion for everyone.



One way to understand and address urban economic segregation is to model its dynamics, and to run and compare policy scenarios on how to reduce it. Following recent developments in analytical sociology and computational social sciences, generative modelling (such as Agent-based modelling) has proven valuable to implement, combine and test causal theories through mechanistic representation. By showing how urban economic segregation persists and evolves due to individual interactions in space, we aim to advance our understanding of the interplay between economic inequality and residential segregation and to better assess possible remediatory policies.



This doctoral position represents an exciting opportunity to combine and develop the latest methods of modular social simulation, empirically-calibrated agent-based models and spatially explicit population synthesis on a socially relevant topic. You will be expected to 1/Build a synthetic population from sociodemographic and spatial microdata ; 2/ Build a modular Agent-based model of urban economic segregation, that translates a set of identified theories into social mechanisms ; 3/Evaluate and calibrate the model configurations against sociodemographic and spatial microdata ; 4/ Implement, run and compare policy scenarios on the calibrated model ; 5/ Write, submit and present related articles to relevant journals and conferences.



This research programme should lead to two areas of innovation. First, you will advance research on urban economic segregation by providing a theoretically grounded and empirically calibrated agent based model on which to test policy scenarios. Second, you will participate in on-going methodological research on spatially explicit synthetic populations and modular model building (including reusable building blocks) in the field of social simulation. Please apply if you think these challenges are exciting opportunities for you to grow as a computational social scientist.



In order to meet the challenges of this doctoral project, you should have experience in the fields of spatially-explicit social simulation, model evaluation and population synthesis. social science and spatial sciences. The successful candidate will be funded by the ERC Starting Grant SEGUE and will work in close collaboration with its members: a PhD student, a postdoctoral researcher and the Principal Investigator Dr. Clémentine Cottineau. You will find support within the Urban Studies section of the Urbanism Department of TU Delft Architecture – a recognised centre of expertise in working on urban inequality with longitudinal microdata –, and link up with the Multi-actor systems group at the TPM faculty of TU Delft.


Requirements


Need to have:


* Completed Masters degree in computational social science, analytical sociology, complex systems science, urban studies, spatial economics, social statistics, economic geography or other relevant fields linked to agent-based modelling and spatially orientated quantitative social science;
* Knowledge and experience in agent-based modelling (model building, analysis, evaluation);
* Knowledge and experience with population synthesis;
* Knowledge and experience with object oriented programming;
* Interest in multidisciplinarity research;
* Ability to handle and combine the abstract concepts and theories of inequality and segregation;
* Ability to work in a team, take initiative, be creative;
* Good command of verbal and written English.


Nice to have:


* Experience of linking agent based models with large empirical data;
* Interest in open source software and scientific reproducibility.


Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis.

Then this PhD position might be for you!


**Your job**
------------


Mountains are the water towers of the world. They receive a disproportionately large amount of precipitation due to orographic lifting. The most important water towers are Asia’s mountain ranges, particularly the Himalaya, the Karakoram and the Pamir. These mountains contain the largest ice reserves beyond the polar regions and are therefore often collectively referred to as the Third Pole.


Here, mountain precipitation feeds glaciers and snowpacks, generating river flow that supplies major reservoirs and sustains millions of people downstream. Extreme mountain precipitation can also trigger floods, landslides, debris flows, and avalanches. Understanding the drivers and magnitude of mountain precipitation is essential for quantifying the mountain water cycle.


In the ERC Advanced project DROP, you will be part of a team investigating how mountains, land-surface feedback, and large-scale atmospheric circulation influence the distribution of mountain precipitation on the Third Pole.


In this PhD project, you will focus on high-altitude snow and rainfall patterns in two climatically contrasting catchments: one in the Himalayas and one in the Pamir mountain range.

Then this opportunity might be for you!


**Your job**
------------


Mountains are the water towers of the world. They receive a disproportionately large amount of precipitation due to orographic lifting. The most important water towers are Asia’s mountain ranges, particularly the Himalaya, the Karakoram and the Pamir. These mountains contain the largest ice reserves beyond the polar regions and are therefore often collectively referred to as the Third Pole.


Here, mountain precipitation feeds glaciers and snowpacks, generating river flow that supplies major reservoirs and sustains millions of people downstream. At the same time, extreme mountain precipitation triggers floods, landslides, debris flows, and avalanches. Without understanding the drivers and magnitude of mountain precipitation, quantifying the mountain water cycle is virtually impossible. You will work as a team member in the ERC Advanced project DROP, which focuses on understanding how mountains, land-surface feedbacks, and large-scale atmospheric circulation control the distribution of mountain precipitation in time and space on the Third Pole.


In this PhD project, you will focus on understanding the interaction between mountain ranges and precipitation using observations and large-scale remote sensing at the synoptic scale. You will combine observations, remote sensing, and outputs from an atmospheric model to investigate and explain seasonal differences in the large-scale orography-precipitation interplay. You will work closely with another PhD candidate and a postdoc in the same project.

**Aantal** **uur**: 32 – 40 uur



Als Data & Analytics Consultant ben je verantwoordelijk voor het vertalen van de ideeën en wensen van onze klanten naar functionele requirements en praktische, waardevolle oplossingen. Deze oplossingen zullen gebouwd worden met Microsoft technologie, de technologie die wij gebruiken voor al onze oplossingen. Onze consultants zijn bedreven in het ontwerpen en bouwen van kwalitatieve en efficiënte dataoplossingen, maar voelen zich tegelijkertijd ook comfortabel bij het voeren van gesprekken met de klant en het managen van belanghebbenden. Jij bent daarom dé brug tussen de klant en de ontwikkelaars en begrijpt niet alleen de business, maar hebt ook kennis van de technologieën binnen het datadomein. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse verantwoordelijkheden zijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van kleine, snelle projecten bij kleinere Nederlandse klanten waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig kunt werken tot grote projecten bij grote Duitse spelers waarbij je onderdeel bent van een groot project team.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Fabric, AI, Copilot, Databricks, Data Strategie, Trainingen, of wil je je verdiepen in het gebied van datavisualisatie? Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou.

Een rol met impact: die heb je als data-analist bij ons Sanctieteam in Utrecht zeker. Jij draagt bij aan een rechtvaardig en integer financieel stelsel. En tilt de Volksbank op het gebied van data naar een nog hoger niveau.


Jij speelt als de data-analist in ons Sanctieteam een sleutelrol in het screeningsproces. Dat doe je door op basis van requirements diverse databestanden te analyseren en zo afwijkende transacties en risicovolle (potentiële) klanten in kaart te brengen. Belangrijk, want bij de Volksbank willen we weten wie onze klanten zijn. Bijvoorbeeld om snel in te kunnen grijpen als we met iemand zaken doen die op een sanctielijst staat. Het aantal sancties en het aantal transacties groeien snel, waardoor een goede screening hoog op onze prioriteitenlijst staat. Daarnaast verandert wet- en regelgeving regelmatig.


Data zijn voor ons van doorslaggevend belang voor het kennen van onze (potentiële) klanten. Daarom werken we steeds meer datagedreven. Jij bouwt naast je analysewerk volop mee aan een datagedreven organisatie, waarbij je focust op een optimale inrichting van onze screening. Zo adviseer je over verbeteringen in onze systemen, processen en procedures om de screening zo effectief en efficiënt mogelijk uit te voeren.


Je krijgt veel vrijheid en autonomie, want wij werken agile. Jouw visie op data telt echt mee en is bepalend voor je team én de hele bank. Bij ons tref je ook de ideale omgeving om verder te groeien binnen jouw vakgebied. Verspreid over de hele organisatie werken namelijk data-analisten die je ontmoet in ons gilde. Hier delen we best practices en vragen we elkaar om hulp.


Hier kom je te werken


Het Sanctieteam is jouw thuisbasis. We zijn een multidisciplinair team van 16 collega’s: inhoudelijke experts, IT-specialisten en kenners van processen. In korte tijd zijn we gegroeid met veel nieuwe collega’s. Daar merk je trouwens weinig van; we werken samen alsof we elkaar al jaren kennen. We komen in elk geval één keer per week samen op kantoor in Utrecht.


Jouw kwaliteiten


Hoe jij bekend staat? Als doortastend en communicatief sterk. Zo vertaal je ruwe gegevens efficiënt naar heldere informatie waar je collega’s écht iets mee kunnen. Met je scherpe analytische blik ben je continu op zoek naar verbeterpotentieel. Bovendien werk je graag samen en houd je, ook onder druk, het hoofd koel.


Verder heb je:

* Hbo werk- en denkniveau
* Ervaring met grote datasets en het opschonen en transformeren van data.
* Ervaring met programmeertalen, zoals Python/PySpark, SQL en R.
* Ervaring met data-analysetools, zoals Excel en Microsoft Power BI of Jupyter.


Wat krijg je van ons?


Onze salarisschaal loopt van € 3.609,86 en € 5.553,63. Jouw salaris voor deze functie ligt tussen de € 4.165,22 en € 5.553,63 euro bruto per maand op basis van 36 uur per week.


Daarnaast kun je rekenen op:


* Een 36-urige werkweek, flexibel in te delen met bijvoorbeeld 4x9. 32 uur is bespreekbaar.
* Vakantiegeld en een dertiende maand, waarbij je via het individueel keuzebudget (IKB) zel kiest wanneer je dit ontvangt.
* 208,8 verlofuren o.b.v. fulltime dienstverband ongeacht je leeftijd.
* Een goede collectieve pensioenregeling.
* Alle vrijheid om zelf je ideale werkplek te bepalen. Thuiswerken is bij ons heel normaal.
* Een persoonlijk opleidingsbudget van € 750,- per jaar, naast de standaard opleidingsmogelijkheden.
* Iedere 5 jaar een budget van € 900,- om jouw thuiswerkplek in te richten.
* Een NS-Business Card én een vergoeding per km als je naar werk fietst.
* Een fietsplan om voordelig een fiets aan te schaffen.
* 2 werkdagen doorbetaald vrijwilligerswerk.
* Een vitaliteitsprogramma met workshops en coaching voor jouw mentale en fysieke gezondheid.
Een laptop en telefoon.

**Aantal uur:** 32 – 40 uur



Als Data Engineer bij Macaw werk je samen met onze klanten aan het ontwerpen, bouwen en onderhouden van hun data platform, van bronontsluiting tot het beschikbaar stellen van data voor gebruikers. Daarnaast spelen ook orchestratie, beveiliging en adoptie van het platform een belangrijke rol in jouw functie. Wij werken met Microsoft technologie, dit betekent dat je aan de slag zal gaan met Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics en/of Microsoft Fabric. Je zal onderdeel worden van het team Data Solutions & Insights (DSI). Dit team bestaat uit ongeveer 50 collega’s verdeeld over 5 kleinere teams. DSI is een van de zes units binnen Macaw, waarbij alle units samen Macaw zo’n 400 medewerkers groot maakt.



Jouw dagelijkse werkzaamhedenzijn afhankelijk van twee aspecten: de klantprojecten en jouw interesse in het deelnemen aan interne projecten. De klantprojecten variëren enorm, van projecten bij kleinere organisaties waar je onafhankelijk en zelfstandig als engineer aan de slag kan gaan tot grotere bedrijven waarbij onderdeel bent van een groot projectteam waarin je samenwerkt met projectmanagers, solution architecten en ontwikkelaars. Onze klanten bevinden zich voornamelijk in Nederland en in Duitsland.



Onze interne projecten draaien om jouw eigen interesse: Ben jij een liefhebber van Microsoft Fabric, AI, Copilot, Azure Databricks, of wil jij je verdiepen in data strategie en data governance? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen en waar jij de mogelijkheid hebt om je kennis ook op andere gebieden verder te ontwikkelen. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan ons Smart Data Platform, een Data Platform accelerator die we intern ontwikkelen en onderhouden. Het doel van dit platform is om data platform projecten sneller en efficiënter op te starten door middel van referentie architecturen, standaardoplossingen, best practices en slimme herbruikbare laadpatronen. Het is inmiddels met succes ingezet bij meerdere van onze klanten.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* Wij zijn op zoek naar collega’s die houden van uitdaging en variatie. Elke opdracht die we bij de klant uitvoeren is uniek. Als medior ben je niet alleen bekend met de verschillende oplossingen en technieken, maar zie jij ook de kans om patronen te herkennen bij de klanten en daardoor de kennis en ervaring die je hebt opgedaan bij de ene klant toe te passen bij de andere klant.
* Je doet niet (altijd) wat er direct van je gevraagd wordt, maar probeert de onderliggende vraag te achterhalen zodat je op basis van die informatie een passende oplossing kunt bedenken.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een code zonder structuur is erg lastig te begrijpen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Het ontwikkelen en ontwerpen van betrouwbare, gebruiksvriendelijke en eenvoudig te beheren data platformen binnen het Microsoft ecosysteem.
* Het bouwen van efficiënte data pipelines met Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks en/of Microsoft Fabric
* Het opstellen van overzichtelijke en goed presterende datamodellen. Voor implementatie gebruik je Python, SQL, PySpark of SparkSQL.
* Onze klantomgevingen worden maximaal gemanaged met Azure DevOps. Het ontwikkelen van deployment scripts en pipelines behoren dan ook tot jouw werkzaamheden.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al 1-3 jaar werkervaring opgedaan in dit vakgebied in soortgelijke rol.
* Je hebt ervaring met het gebruik van Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks en/of Azure Synapse Analytics en weet hoe je deze technologieën kunt gebruiken op een efficiënte manier.
* Je hebt ervaring in het werken met grote datasets en weet hoe je oplossingen moet ontwikkelen om grote hoeveelheden aan data op een zo efficiënt mogelijke wijze te verwerken.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Je blijft graag op de hoogte en verdiept je in nieuwste ontwikkelingen binnen het Microsoft domein, zoals Fabric en Copilot, en bent enthousiast om hiermee te experimenteren.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down – We hebben een fijn team met veel ervaren collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets te ver buiten je comfortzone ligt.
* Een mooi salaris én een mobiliteitsvergoeding voor een leaseauto en/of ns-businesscard
* 29 Vakantiedagen, die nog kunnen oplopen tot 33 dagen
* Toegang tot een ruim opleidingsbudget en veel ruimte voor ontwikkeling
* Flexibele werktijden (32-40), deels thuis en op kantoor of bij de klant
* Wil je ontspannen op kantoor? Doe mee aan het tafeltennistoernooi, speel gezellig een potje met je collega’s op de Xbox of ga de strijd aan met elkaar bij de pooltafel.

-----------------------------

  

  

In this role you will work on the business side of analytics. Next to your fellow data- analysts and scientists, you will work together with people from all over the supply chain organization. Your job is to transform data into value for them. Therefore, besides having a proper advanced analytics skillset, you should be able to understand the important drivers within the Supply Chain. Most of the time you will actively participate in cross-functional project teams. But sometimes you will work on something initiated by our own team in order to explore or challenge the status quo. This will be important for Action, our team, but also yourself in order to keep growing.


Your work will consist out of:

* building simulation models to simulate processes in our Supply Chain. These simulations help to understand the implications of possible changes and could trigger redesigns of processes. Simulating different put-away strategies is a good example that also lead to an actual change in our warehouse processes.
* building optimization models to define the most effective and efficient way of doing things. This includes linear optimization models as well as heuristics based solutions. A model which defines the optimal pick routes in our warehouses, is a perfect example of this.
* working on predictive and machine learning models, to better prepare for what’s coming. These models can be used in operations to plan for example their workforces, but they can also be used by process managers to (re)design their processes.
* performing complex (statistical) analysis to track relationships, understand effects of changes and find areas for improvement. You could think about cases such as ‘how much does congestion in the warehouses impact the productivity and what can we do to prevent that’.
**Meet your team**
------------------

  

As Data Scientist you will be part of the Supply Chain Support & Processes department and report directly to the Manager Supply Chain Analytics. SC Analytics is responsible for Business Analytics within the expanding European supply chain network of Action. The scope is End-to-End, so it will start at our suppliers, includes our hub-, cross dock- and warehouse network, and ends with the delivery at the stores. Working in the Supply Chain of Action means working in a dynamic and highly motivated environment that is constantly looking for improvements. How can we optimize our supply chain network? What is the most efficient and effective way of executing processes? Since there are more data- scientists and analysts working in the team you can team up with experience and knowledge to achieve the best results for Action and learn from each other.**This is you**
---------------

  

  

You have strong analytical skills with the ability to transfer business requirements into mathematical models, to provide solutions that deliver true value. You can transform complex data into actionable insights and are proficient in presenting it. You are a pragmatic thinker who works effectively with others to achieve common targets. Last but not least you have a good set of communication skills and are fluent in English.

*Furthermore you have:*

* Degree degree in a quantitative field such as Operations research, Econometrics, Applied Mathematics, Business Analytics, or equivalent
* 2-5 years’ work experience as data scientist. Experience in Supply Chain is a plus
* Experience with simulation- and optimization models is must (e.g. discrete-event modeling, local search heuristics and integer linear programming)
* Experience with statistical analyses, predictive modeling and machine learning is a plus (e.g. clustering, time-series forecasting, classification and regression)
* Experience in SQL, Python, PySpark, Databricks, Github, Azure DevOps, VS code is a must. Experience in C++ or AIMMS is a plus.
**What we offer**
-----------------


* Annual bonus scheme based on personal and company targets;
* 24 paid holidays and the opportunity to buy up to 5 additional holidays;
* Commuting allowance;
* Hybrid working (3 days at HQ in Zwaagdijk-Oost)

Wij maken van Albert Heijn het beste omnichannel Food & Tech bedrijf en willen digitaal gemak voor iedereen. We testen en experimenteren, zijn innovatief en verleggen grenzen. Voor die reis hebben wij het Data Talent Track. Een track waarin wij jouw carrière als Data Analyst bij Albert Heijn een vliegende start geven binnen onze Digital Analytics afdeling. Is dit echt iets voor jou? Word dan de nieuwe Data Analyst in ons Data Talent Track!

  

  

**Jouw nieuwe baan en werkplek**  

Als Data Analyst ken jij onze klant het beste. Deze kennis verkrijg je door gebruik te maken van data (zoals bijvoorbeeld data over koopgedrag), om zo de performance van de business te verhogen. Tijdens het aandragen en ontwikkelen van data-oplossingen breng je zowel creativiteit als pragmatisme mee en werk met de nieuwste data analytics technieken. Je maakt onderdeel uit van het Digital Analytics & Data Science team, en bent daarmee onderdeel van de grotere Analytics community binnen Albert Heijn. Je beweegt makkelijk tussen Tech, Data Science en de business teams, waarbij je enerzijds meedenkt op strategisch en tactisch niveau en anderzijds verantwoordelijk bent voor het bouwen en implementeren van verschillende data analytics toepassingen. Je maakt impact als Data Analist door:

* Onze omnichannel strategie proactief te vertalen in data gedreven advies
* Het analyseren van verschillende typen data (zoals transactiedata, klant- en marktdata) om van daaruit scherpe inzichten te formuleren over onze klanten, onze concurrenten en de markt op basis waarvan we de juiste acties kunnen ondernemen om onze business doelen te behalen
* Het introduceren van nieuwe analyse methodes en modellen
* Creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe inzichten door gebruik te maken van (nieuwe) databronnen
* Data inzichten te vertalen naar experimenten voor innovatieve toepassingen, denk hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan oplossingen om een relevantere klantreis aan te bieden binnen onze Digitale kanalen
* Het hebben van een pragmatische doch onderbouwde aanpak, een simpele oplossing is vaak beter dan een complexe. Het gaat om de impact, niet om het model
* De verschillende stakeholders mee te nemen: van data analyses naar bruikbare inzichten

  



**Dit doe je als Data Analyst Digital**

Het Digital domein richt zich op digitale relevantie, experimentation, eCommerce en klantloyaliteit. Hiervoor voeren we data-analyses uit of ontwikkelen wij dataproducten om onze e-commerce en Digital-afdelingen te ondersteunen met inzichten rondom onze klanten, het verbeteren van e-commerce en het verbeteren van de customer journey. Denk daarbij aan projecten zoals het relevanter maken van onze aanbiedingen (Mijn Bonus Box) of marketing, inzichtelijk maken van de omnichannel customer journeys en het analyseren van onze spaarprogramma’s.

  



**Jouw ontwikkeling in het Data Talent Track**


Het Data Talent Track is een anderhalf jaar durend programma vol met soft- en hard skills trainingen die je helpen om jouw professionele vaardigheden te ontwikkelen. Zo zijn er trainingen zoals persoonlijk leiderschap en het efficiënter schrijven van code, maar ga je bijvoorbeeld ook een dagje meehelpen in de winkel of bouw je mee aan de ideeën van de toekomst in een Hackathon. Wil je meer weten over hoe het Data Talent Track eruitziet? Neem dan vooral ook eens een kijkje hier.

 **De beste ingrediënten voor een betekenisvolle baan**

* Een salaris van max € 4000,- per periode van 4 weken (afhankelijk van je ervaring)

Jij vindt het leuk om aan complexe data-vraagstukken te werken. Je bent de spin in het web als het gaat om data extracten, transformeren en klaarzetten voor verder gebruik binnen organisaties, rekening houdend met de performance van de data-verwerking middels jobs die jij zelf configureert en beheert. Daarnaast zit je boordevol ideeën hoe de omgeving te verbeteren, waarbij je steeds de klant centraal plaatst.

Daarmee hebben we naam en faam gemaakt in verschillende sectoren en daar gaan we het liefst nog even mee door.

CINQ is opgesplitst in 3 business units met ieder een eigen expertise. Niet dat we ervan houden om in hokjes te denken, maar dit werkt in de praktijk nu eenmaal het beste.

Bij een klant meedraaien in een team tot aan het uit de grond stampen van een splinternieuwe dataomgeving: als dataspecialist komt er van alles op je bord.

Vind jij het leuk om analytische tools te bouwen, kun jij overweg met grote hoeveelheden data én word jij blij van code? Dan is dit een leuke uitdaging voor jou!


Technologie speelt een steeds grotere rol bij BDO. Om relevant en concurrerend te blijven, worden werkprocessen verder geautomatiseerd; het ‘BDO Data & technologie platform’ speelt hierin een belangrijke rol. Binnen dit data platform heeft ook het audit domein een prominente rol.


Audit (jaarrekeningcontrole) is belangrijk voor de maatschappij omdat het ervoor zorgt dat bedrijven en organisaties financiële transparantie bieden en dat de financiële informatie die zij verstrekken betrouwbaar is. Dit is belangrijk voor investeerders, consumenten, aandeelhouders en andere belanghebbenden om weloverwogen beslissingen te kunnen nemen.


De audit is al een aantal jaren volop in verandering: data-analyse, data process automation en performante-rapportages zijn inmiddels onmisbaar binnen het vakgebied en de werkzaamheden van de accountant. Audit Innovation & Technology (AI&T) is het team binnen de Line of Service Audit & Assurance dat zich richt op het innoveren en ontwikkelen van hoogwaardige audit-gerelateerde producten.


Binnen dit team zijn 10 collega’s werkzaam, waarvan 7 collega’s zich bezighouden met data engineering / analyse. De andere 3 collega’s houden zich bezig met het aansturen van projecten. Als team proberen wij de brug te vormen tussen het audit domein en het technische (data) domein. Het toepassen van domeinkennis en de technische kennis is een essentiële factor voor succesvolle en bruikbare producten. Om een nog meer data- en technologie gedreven organisatie te worden, zoeken wij een Data Engineer binnen het AI&T team.

 **Vacatureomschrijving**  

Als Data Engineer werk je samen met andere analisten en accountants om de audit processen te verbeteren en te automatiseren. Binnen BDO werken wij in de Azure Stack. Je werkt hierbij met technologieën zoals Azure Data Factory en Databricks; daarin gebruiken wij programmeertalen zoals SQL en Python. Ook zul je kennis maken met Microsoft Fabric, in deze nieuwe tooling van Microsoft willen wij ons dataplatform in de toekomst onderbrengen; hierin zal de medaillon architecture leidend zijn.


Binnen de werkzaamheden wordt gebruik gemaakt van lakehouses, datawarehouses en data modellen. Met deze toepassingen zijn wij in staat om de accountant te voorzien van de analyses die ze op dat moment nodig hebben met een daar bijhorende performance.


Er is als Data Engineer ook ruimte om nieuwe technieken uit te proberen en te onderzoeken, zoals bijvoorbeeld AI toepassingen. Er is genoeg ruimte voor jouw eigen inbreng en ideeën, dit wordt erg gewaardeerd.

**Je belangrijkste taken zijn:**

* Ontwikkelen van notebooks en data pipelines
* Analyse en PowerBI dashboards maken voor onze audit collega’s
* Processen automatiseren aan de hand van beschikbare (financiële) data
* Meedenken en beslissen wat de beste keuzes zijn in onze medaillon architecture in ons platform

**Benodigde Kennis/Ervaring:**

* Minimaal 3 jaar werkervaring
* Een afgeronde relevante (technische) opleiding op WO of HBO-niveau in de richting van Data / Business Analytics
* Kennis van datatools (bij voorkeur Databricks, Azure Datafactory en Power BI)
* Python en SQL

**Fijne pre's:**

* Kennis van jaarrekeningcontrole
* Kennis van Microsoft Fabric
* Kennis van Pyspark

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

**Stageopdracht | Hbo - Wo | SPECTO Aerospace | Amsterdam Lelystad Airport**

  

**""Het bouwen van een geavanceerd systeem waarin middels** Dynamic Augmented Reality technische informatie vanuit de echte wereld wordt toegevoegd aan een virtueel 3D vliegtuigonderdeel. **Die stap zetten we graag samen met jou!""**

  

Bij SPECTO Aerospace, een gecertificeerd luchtvaart-technisch bedrijf gevestigd op Lelystad-Airport en op de luchtmachtbasis in Woensdrecht, repareren we hoogwaardige composiet onderdelen voor de internationale luchtvaart- en defensie-industrie. Met een team van ongeveer 50 collega's werken we hard aan onze toekomst. Alles draait bij ons om vindingrijkheid, innovatie en kwaliteit en daarom zetten wij als onderhoudsbedrijf technologie-stappen die verder gaan dan de vereisten binnen de luchtvaartbranche. We zijn trots op ons vak en hebben allemaal hart voor de zaak. Samen gaan we voor het beste resultaat en helpen we elkaar waar nodig. Bij ons heerst een open en familiaire sfeer, waarbij onze kernwaardes gericht zijn op mensen.

  

**De Casus**



SPECTO is in feite een ambachtsbedrijf in een high-tech omgeving (www.spectoaerospace.com). Wij hebben ons ten doel gesteld om verregaand te digitaliseren. Niet omdat dat efficiënter is maar ook omdat ons dat gaat helpen om ‘het spel te veranderen’. In het reparatieproces van composiet vliegtuigonderdelen wordt standaard al een veelheid aan detailgegevens vastgelegd door specialisten en engineers en wij willen deze informatie in een 3D-omgeving gaan verwerken om hiermee in beelden te kunnen communiceren naar stakeholders (Visualization), om informatie tijdens het proces te ontsluiten en op te slaan (Digital Twinning) en om al deze data te kunnen analyseren om de volgende generatie vliegtuigonderdelen te kunnen ontwerpen (Data Analytics). Hiervoor willen wij onze schaal 1:1 3D-modellen gaan gebruiken die wij zelf met onze eigen geavanceerde scannerapparatuur maken van vliegtuigonderdelen

 **De Opdracht**

  

Wij hebben een Proof of Concept applicatie ontwikkeld waarin wij in staat zijn om vormen te tekenen op een 3D model en deze te linken aan onderliggende data. Deze applicatie is echter nog niet af: wij willen 3D kleur- en meetdata op een laagdrempelige manier kunnen opnemen vanuit de realiteit (fysieke omgeving) en deze vastleggen/overzetten als informatielaag op het 3D model in de virtuele omgeving. Voor deze opdracht is het een vereiste dat je sterke affiniteit dan wel ervaring hebt met werken met 3D technieken. Denk hierbij aan bijvoorbeeld fotogrammetrie technieken, Augmented Reality of UV-mapping.

 **Wat mag j****e verwachten van SPECTO**


* Een leeromgeving waarin we met je samenwerken en je echt onderdeel bent van het SPECTO Team!
* Flexibiliteit in werktijden en locaties
* Een marktconforme stagevergoeding
### **Vereisten**

**Wat verwachten we van jou als Stagiair?**

  


Jij bent een enthousiaste teamspeler die het leuk vindt om samen met ons op Lelystad Airport nieuwe oplossingen te bedenken, te onderzoeken, te bouwen én te testen. Je bent een creatieve denker en je hebt een passie voor nieuwe technologie en tools.

  

Verder vragen wij:


* Je volgt een studie in de richting Hbo ICT Software Engineering, Creative Media and Gaming Technologies of vergelijkbaar (3e of 4e jaar)
* Je bent bekend met onder meer Unity, C# en/of Java
* Werken met 3D modellen, fotogrammetrie en/of UV-mapping is een pré
* Je bent natuurlijk in staat om zelfstandig en gestructureerd te werken

 **De volgende stap**

  


Ben jij enthousiast geworden over de stageopdracht Aerospace Data Visualization in 3D en wil je deel uitmaken van ons team? Solliciteer dan direct via de sollicitatieknop! Als je vragen hebt, neem dan gerust contact op met Tijmen Koelewijn (Recruitment Business Partner) via jobs@spectoaerospace.com of 06-13285298.

 ***We do it right:*** When you’re moving fast it can be tempting to constantly cut corners to things done. But this results in a product that is a struggle to work with and has unhappy users. We make that extra effort to be proud of what we’re building; understand the problem we’re solving, write one more test or tackle technical debt.

 ***We are empowered to act, challenge and lead:*** To work effectively as a team everyone must have a voice and feel they can stand up and be counted. As a software engineer at Returnista we want you to feel empowered. That could mean proposing new ideas, fixing things without seeking permission or challenging the CEO.

 ***We are intrepid:*** We want our engineers to show initiative and to innovate. Intrepid Friday’s give us the opportunity to work on things that might not ostensibly be the highest priority, but can make a big difference to our product or how we work.

-----------------


Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is offering a fully funded, four-year PhD-position, as part of the European Research Council (ERC) project “Where are the Humanities in the Medical Humanities? How Comics Can Improve Healthcare Training, Practice, and Dissemination” (2024-2029), led by Dr. Erin La Cour at the Faculty of Humanities. **The start date of the position is February 1, 2025.**


How can healthcare become more attentive to individual patient experiences? How can we *talk with* and *talk back to* practitioners and systems? What tools are needed to open productive dialogue?


This ERC project will critically elaborate the benefits of further integrating insights from the Humanities in the Critical Medical and Health Humanities by examining and expanding discourse on Graphic Medicine. A flourishing field that utilizes theoretical and artistic research practices in productive reciprocal exchange, Graphic Medicine is attentive to how the study and production of comics about health and healthcare echo calls within the Critical Medical and Health Humanities for the urgent need for different understandings and expressions of illness and disability than those found in conventional medical discourse. Focused on bottom-up, experiential knowledge, Graphic Medicine promotes comics as an important medium to depict interactions between individuals, their families and carers, a wide array of healthcare workers, and healthcare systems as scenes of intercultural, interdiscursive, and intergenerational encounter.


Through cross-national, cross-cultural, and cross-linguistic analyses of Graphic Medicine, from healthcare education to online information, and from individual artistic practices to collaborations between comics artists and healthcare institutions, this project will critically and comprehensively evaluate and develop the aims, current applications, and potential of Graphic Medicine across five individual subprojects. In so doing, it will also advance an understanding of creative practices as capable of critiquing and producing theory, will develop the discourse of what counts as healthcare knowledge, and will contribute to the aims of the Critical Medical and Health Humanities to offer new insights for healthcare training, practice, and dissemination.


**Graphic Medicine Online**


The PhD subproject, Graphic Medicine Online, will contribute to the overall aims of the ERC project through a comparative analysis of available online information on Graphic Medicine in English, Dutch, and French. Utilizing (and modifying) open-access data crawling software to aggregate available online information about Graphic Medicine in these three languages, including primary texts (comics) and secondary texts (theoretical and popular articles, blog posts, etc.), the PhD will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate how the discourse and practice of Graphic Medicine travels and shifts across national, cultural, and/or linguistic contexts. In so doing, it will create a comprehensive overview of Graphic Medicine in and across these three languages, and, through developing an online database of the project’s findings, will create an unprecedented resource for the advancement of research in the field.


*Key outputs of the PhD subproject:*


* An open-access and keyword searchable database of Graphic Medicine comics and scholarly and publicly-oriented articles on Graphic Medicine in English, Dutch, and French, including works translated into these languages, built from the aggregated information the PhD has collected, assessed, and keyword tagged (e.g. country of origin, language, translation, topic(s), perspective(s), discipline(s), target audience(s), source reliability, etc.). \*The database will be supported by a web programmer who will assist in preparing the backend database for a frontend website.
* A PhD dissertation on the project’s research methods and findings. Through a discussion of the project’s development of digital methods to create ways of finding, scraping, tagging, comparing, and translating the mentions of Graphic Medicine online in the three languages, and a visualization of the crawler’s trace to show the nodes of research and discourse, the PhD will develop theory through its method. The project will also seek to answer how much information is available and to which audience, how the discourse travels, and what shifts in meaning arise through translation into different national, cultural, and/or linguistic contexts. As such, the PhD dissertation will contribute to the field an engagement with the need for greater access to and dissemination of Graphic Medicine and the importance of accessibility to reliable healthcare information.


**Your duties**


* conduct research for and complete a PhD dissertation, as outlined above
* create an open-access and keyword searchable database of Graphic Medicine, as outlined above
* publish three (individually or co-authored) peer-reviewed journal articles or book chapters
* present research at national and international conferences
* collaborate with the team on research dissemination, including co-organizing workshops and conferences, and preparing a collected volume


**Your profile**
----------------

* you hold a Master’s degree in a relevant field (e.g. digital humanities, computational linguistics, comics studies, comparative literature, media studies, cultural studies, cultural analysis) at the time of appointment
* you have a demonstrable grounding in comics studies and one or more of the research fields central to the project: graphic medicine, critical disability studies, critical medical and health humanities, cultural analysis
* you have demonstrable knowledge of and experience with digital methods, including data collection, quantitative and qualitative analysis, programming languages (e.g. Python, R), scripting and coding, and preferably, knowledge of and experience with natural language processing (NLP)
* you have outstanding research skills as evidenced by strong BA and MA transcripts, and are motivated to conduct high quality research with the aim of publication in top journals
* you have an affinity for working interdisciplinarily, collaboratively, and within a team of researchers
* you have an excellent command of English (C1-C2) and a very good command of reading Dutch and French (B2-C1)
* if not already based in The Netherlands, you are willing to relocate to The Netherlands for the duration of your PhD
* you are willing to travel abroad for conferences and workshops

Our mission at Netflix is to connect global stories with global audiences.

Our scope will grow to include premium live entertainment with our growing Live content catalogue, including WWE, NFL, and more.


Getting this evidence just right for each title is a tall order but our creative strategists, art designers, and video editors are masters of this. Perhaps a more unique aspect of Netflix is that these teams deeply leverage data to inform their decision making as they go about creative tasks like designing artwork & cutting trailers or clips. This is made possible because Netflix UI is a thriving learning machine where Artwork & Video assets are personalized via reinforcement learning.

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=97cd532fe44864fd,indeed,Data Analyst,Orbisk,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Orbisk,"Utrecht, UT, NL","parttime, fulltime",2024-08-15,,,,,True,,,,"**Our employees talk trash all day, every day.**

**That’s why we love them!**

Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  
Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.

In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

**The role in 6 bullets**

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

**Your track record mentions**

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

**Why join Orbisk?**

For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Uiteraard willen we een goede teamdynamiek en streven we ernaar tenminste 1 of 2 dagen per week met elkaar op kantoor te werken.
* **Ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Heb je ideeën over de contentstrategie, zie je een ‘gat in de markt’? Wij stimuleren een creatieve werkomgeving en vinden het leuk te experimenteren met nieuwe ideeën.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** – Een goed salaris, individueel keuze-budget dat je naar eigen inzicht kunt besteden en een pensioenvoorziening. Daarnaast leuke extra’s zoals borrels, feestjes en natuurlijk gezellige collega’s.

**Team Code**


Team Code houdt zich bezig met ontwerpend onderzoek. We ontwerpen nieuwe technologie en nemen publieke waarden als uitgangspunt: technologie is namelijk niet zomaar een instrument, maar kan het (samen)leven van mensen diepgaand beïnvloeden. Code kijkt hoe technologie de positie van burgers kan versterken: democratisering door middel van digitalisering. Het team bestaat uit software ontwerpers, techniek filosofen en sociale wetenschappers.

**Over Waag Futurelab**


Waag Futurelab doet al bijna 30 jaar onderzoek naar hoe technologie kan worden ingezet voor sociale innovatie. Bekende projecten van Waag zijn o.a. Fairphone, de meest duurzame smartphone ter wereld of De Digitale Stad, een van de allereerste social media platforms van Nederland. Of denk aan Operatie Sigismund, een van de eerste educatieve games in Nederland die leerlingen laat ervaren hoe spannend een archief is en nog steeds wekelijks gespeeld wordt in het Drents Archief.


 Je toekomstige collega Ouarda vertelt over werken bij Waag*: ‘De vrijheid die ik van de organisatie krijg om mijn eigen projecten in te kleuren doet mij heel erg goed. Collega’s waarderen mij, ik kan mezelf zijn en dat maakt het een fijne werkplek.’*


Waag werkt in een team van ontwerpers, kunstenaars en wetenschappers, dat publieke onderzoeksmethoden toepast op technologie en de samenleving. Daarmee stelt Waag zoveel mogelijk mensen in staat mee te ontwerpen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Dat doen we door gezamenlijk opkomende technologie te onderzoeken en onderliggende culturele aannames te bevragen en door alternatieven te ontwerpen op basis van publieke waarden. Zo proberen we bij te dragen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Op waag.org vind je meer informatie over Waag en over de projecten waaraan wij werken.


Diversiteit is cruciaal om technologie en de samenleving meer open, eerlijk en inclusief te maken. Daarom moedigen we kandidaten van diverse culturele achtergronden aan om te solliciteren. Mocht je denken niet aan alle eisen te voldoen, willen we je toch aanmoedigen om te solliciteren. Sommige kwaliteiten zijn niet in bulletpoints te vangen.

**Deadline:** 9 september 2024  

Mocht de geschikte kandidaat zich eerder melden, sluiten we de vacature eerder - dus wacht niet te lang met reageren!

**De rol in hoofdlijnen**  

Je gaat werken als journalist/redacteur voor **Assurantie Magazine (AM),** het grootste onafhankelijke nieuwsplatform voor financieel dienstverleners. Van verzekeraar tot hypotheekverstrekker en van schadebehandelaar tot pensioenadviseur; AM is al ruim 40 jaar de go-to nieuwsbron voor de verzekeringsbranche. Het is een competitieve, dynamische wereld vol botsende belangen, maar ook een branche met talloze mooie innovaties en maatschappelijke uitdagingen, zoals: hoe verzekeren we de energietransitie, en de steeds grotere cybercrime dreiging?


In deze rol:


* Draag jij met je spraakmakende, diepgravende artikelen en scoops bij aan structurele groei van het aantal betalende abonnees.
* Werk je voor AMweb.nl, waarmee je focus op digitale media ligt en je mede op basis van data je vervolgstappen bepaalt.
* Ben je binnen de redactie owner van je eigen dossiers die vallen onder belangrijke thema’s voor de verzekeringsbranche.
* Ben je als journalist actief betrokken bij de sector. Je kent onze doelgroep door en door, en je onderhoudt je netwerk goed.


**Het team**  

We zijn een divers team van ervaren redacteuren, werkstudenten, event organisatoren en sales collega’s. De redactie van vijf redacteuren werkt aan eigen dossiers binnen thema’s zoals Schade, Hypotheken en het Intermediair, maar is ook nauw betrokken bij de AM Top 100 en ons jaarlijkse grote event voor de branche: AMdag.



Onze redactie ontmoet elkaar een vaste dag per week op kantoor, dan hebben we met elkaar ook de wekelijkse inhoudelijke redactievergadering, en daarnaast spreken we flexibel af en werken we samen via Teams.  



  

  

**Wat breng jij mee?**


* Je hebt journalistieke ervaring, en een portfolio van artikelen en verhalen waar je trots op bent.
* Je bent nieuwsgierig, onderzoekend en kritisch en verdiept je graag in de hete hangijzers en trends binnen de branche.
* Je houdt van de afwisseling die werken op een redactie meebrengt, je vindt het leuk mee te denken over en te schakelen tussen het schrijven van nieuwsberichten en scoops enerzijds en inhoudelijke artikelen die diepgravend onderzoek vragen anderzijds.
* Je hebt kennis van de financiële dienstverlening, of bovengemiddelde interesse en de wil om snel alles te weten te komen over onze doelgroep.


**Ons aanbod**


* Bij VMN kom je om te leren, de ruimte om je journalistieke ideeën te realiseren, en voor de goede werk/privé balans. Wij werken hybride en je hebt veel vrijheid om je eigen werkweek in te delen.
* Wij organiseren veel sociale en inhoudelijke bijeenkomsten, waar je ook de andere VMN collega’s ontmoet, zo kun je leren van en ervaringen uitwisselen met andere journalisten/redacteuren en externe sprekers of trainers. Hoogwaardige journalistiek is de kern van onze organisatie: hierin investeren vinden we belangrijk.
* Een diverse en inclusieve werkomgeving, waar iedereen welkom is en waar we voortdurend werken aan het verhogen van ieders werkgeluk.
* Natuurlijk krijg je ook een goed salaris, een keuzebudget van 12%, een goed pensioen, 20 vakantiedagen per jaar op basis van 36 uur per week en de mogelijkheid om tot 3 weken extra vakantie bij te kopen vanuit je keuzebudget, een laptop en telefoon, reiskostenvergoeding (km) of OV Business Card.

Je bevindingen zet je om in een communicatiestrategie- en aanpak, die je vervolgens samen met collega’s en soms externe bureaus uitvoert.

De diverse belangen van betrokken partijen neem je mee bij het bedenken, coördineren en schrijven van diverse uitingen, zoals het BKR-magazine Inzichtelijk, de externe nieuwsbrieven, de Schulden Monitor, diverse barometers, content voor socialmediakanalen en andere communicatiemiddelen zoals persberichten. Je ondersteunt daarnaast soms ook jouw teammanager als aanspreekpunt voor mediarelaties, persoptredens en klant- en arbeidsmarktcommunicatie.
Je bent werkzaam in team Marketing & Communicatie, dat op dit moment bestaat uit een Communicatieadviseur en een Medewerker Marketing & Communicatie. Je rapporteert aan de Teammanager Marketing & Communicatie, die tevens je leidinggevende is.

=============


Het content communicatieteam van RTL bestaat uit vijf hele leuke collega’s die je met open armen ontvangen. We zijn een team waar nog veel ruimte is voor nieuwe perspectieven. Communicatie en dus ook jouw mening en adviezen worden bij RTL op waarde geschat. Feedback halen, geven en ontvangen is vanzelfsprekend. Je werkt in een uitdagende omgeving die geen dag hetzelfde is. Er is veel ruimte voor eigen inbreng, reflectie en persoonlijke ontwikkeling. Bovendien draag je als senior actief bij aan de richting van onze afdeling. We hebben geen 9-tot-5 mentaliteit, er wordt hard gewerkt, maar ook hard gelachen en er is veel oog voor een goede werk/privé balans. We sturen op output. Je past hier als je vertrouwen hebt in je eigen kunnen, leergierig bent, om hulp durft te vragen als het nodig is en je jouw kennis en kunnen graag deelt met anderen.

De redacties van RTL Nieuws, Editie NL en RTL Z brengen je 24/7 het laatste nieuws, eigen journalistiek onderzoek en duiding via de uitzendingen, website, app en socials. Onze makers vertellen de verhalen die relevant zijn voor Nederland. Persoonlijk, herkenbaar, dichtbij en mede dankzij onze tech- en contentexperts te bekijken waar en wanneer jij dat wil.

**Functieomschrijving**  

Als redactie-analist werk je op de redactie van het AD in Rotterdam. Het is jouw taak om de redactie te helpen met inzichten uit data. Dat betekent dat je met cijfers bezig bent, maar ook veel met redactieleden overlegt en ze traint in hoe ze hun verhalen nog beter online presenteren. Je analyseert, rapporteert en geeft dus advies.

  


Je gaat op zoek naar antwoorden op vragen als: Waarom haken mensen af in een artikel? Wat is de ideale mix aan verhalen? Wat is de optimale spreiding van artikelen over de dag? En waarom stijgt of zakt het bezoek de afgelopen weken?

  


De adviezen geef je op drie ‘snelheden’: live, in dag- en weekrapporten en in losse analyses. Op de dag zelf kijk je met een schuin oog mee naar de cijfers en deel je belangrijke actiegerichte inzichten met de redactie. In dag- en weekrapporten geef je duiding aan de cijfers. Naast de dagelijkse taken voer je ook regelmatig diepgravende analyses uit.

Naast redactie-analisten zijn er diverse centrale rollen in het team die jou bij je werk zullen ondersteunen.  

  

**Functieprofiel**


* Je hebt minimaal ervaring als data-analist óf als journalist. Op beide vlakken ervaring is natuurlijk helemaal mooi meegenomen. Affiniteit met journalistiek is wel een vereiste;
* Je legt en onderhoudt makkelijk contact, kan goed communiceren en hebt voldoende overredingskracht om je eigen ideeën te laten landen;
* Je neemt initiatief en kan goed zelfstandig werken;
* Je hebt hbo/wo-denkniveau;
* Of je hebt je eigen goede redenen waarom we jou zouden moeten spreken over deze baan.


**VOORWAARDEN**


* salaris, passend bij jouw ervaring;
* 38-urige werkweek, minder uur in overleg;
* 8% vakantiegeld en 4% persoonlijk budget;
* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;
* ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden d.m.v. opleidingen en trainingen;
* We geloven in een gezonde werk-privébalans waarbij je voldoende ruimte krijgt voor jouw welzijn en flexibel werken.

Met 24 merken binnen VMN media brengen we nieuws, achtergronden en data binnen verschillende branches, zoals bouw, vastgoed, horeca en supermarkten. 1,5 miljoen professionals in Nederland gebruiken onze content om betere beslissingen te maken in hun werk en hun organisatie en bedrijfstak vooruit te helpen. Want kennis is de drijfveer van vooruitgang.

Uiteraard willen we een goede teamdynamiek en streven we ernaar tenminste 1 of 2 dagen per week met elkaar op kantoor te werken.
* **Ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Heb je ideeën over de contentstrategie, zie je een ‘gat in de markt’? Wij stimuleren een creatieve werkomgeving en vinden het leuk te experimenteren met nieuwe ideeën.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** – Een goed salaris, individueel keuze-budget dat je naar eigen inzicht kunt besteden en een pensioenvoorziening. Daarnaast leuke extra’s zoals borrels, feestjes en natuurlijk gezellige collega’s.

De diverse belangen van betrokken partijen neem je mee bij het bedenken, coördineren en schrijven van diverse uitingen, zoals het BKR-magazine Inzichtelijk, de externe nieuwsbrieven, de Schulden Monitor, diverse barometers, content voor socialmediakanalen en andere communicatiemiddelen zoals persberichten. Je ondersteunt daarnaast soms ook jouw teammanager als aanspreekpunt voor mediarelaties, persoptredens en klant- en arbeidsmarktcommunicatie.
Je bent werkzaam in team Marketing & Communicatie, dat op dit moment bestaat uit een Communicatieadviseur en een Medewerker Marketing & Communicatie. Je rapporteert aan de Teammanager Marketing & Communicatie, die tevens je leidinggevende is.

* jaarlijkse winstdeling o.b.v. de prestaties van DPG Media;

**Team Code**


Team Code houdt zich bezig met ontwerpend onderzoek. We ontwerpen nieuwe technologie en nemen publieke waarden als uitgangspunt: technologie is namelijk niet zomaar een instrument, maar kan het (samen)leven van mensen diepgaand beïnvloeden. Code kijkt hoe technologie de positie van burgers kan versterken: democratisering door middel van digitalisering. Het team bestaat uit software ontwerpers, techniek filosofen en sociale wetenschappers.

**Over Waag Futurelab**


Waag Futurelab doet al bijna 30 jaar onderzoek naar hoe technologie kan worden ingezet voor sociale innovatie. Bekende projecten van Waag zijn o.a. Fairphone, de meest duurzame smartphone ter wereld of De Digitale Stad, een van de allereerste social media platforms van Nederland. Of denk aan Operatie Sigismund, een van de eerste educatieve games in Nederland die leerlingen laat ervaren hoe spannend een archief is en nog steeds wekelijks gespeeld wordt in het Drents Archief.


 Je toekomstige collega Ouarda vertelt over werken bij Waag*: ‘De vrijheid die ik van de organisatie krijg om mijn eigen projecten in te kleuren doet mij heel erg goed. Collega’s waarderen mij, ik kan mezelf zijn en dat maakt het een fijne werkplek.’*


Waag werkt in een team van ontwerpers, kunstenaars en wetenschappers, dat publieke onderzoeksmethoden toepast op technologie en de samenleving. Daarmee stelt Waag zoveel mogelijk mensen in staat mee te ontwerpen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Dat doen we door gezamenlijk opkomende technologie te onderzoeken en onderliggende culturele aannames te bevragen en door alternatieven te ontwerpen op basis van publieke waarden. Zo proberen we bij te dragen aan een open, eerlijke en inclusieve toekomst. Op waag.org vind je meer informatie over Waag en over de projecten waaraan wij werken.


Diversiteit is cruciaal om technologie en de samenleving meer open, eerlijk en inclusief te maken. Daarom moedigen we kandidaten van diverse culturele achtergronden aan om te solliciteren. Mocht je denken niet aan alle eisen te voldoen, willen we je toch aanmoedigen om te solliciteren. Sommige kwaliteiten zijn niet in bulletpoints te vangen.

**Vacature hoofdredacteur Arbo**

  

  

Van werkstress tot machineveiligheid en van hybride werken tot gevaarlijke stoffen. Arbo is het platform dat arboprofessionals ondersteunt in hun dagelijks werk. Door ze te informeren over ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken. Dat doen we via Arbo-online, het vakblad Arbo dat 4 keer per jaar verschijnt en natuurlijk via nieuwsbrieven en social media.  

  

Voor Arbo zoeken we een nieuwe, innovatieve hoofdredacteur.

  


**Wie ben je en wat ga je doen:**


* **Je bent een strategisch denker**. Je zorgt voor de inhoudelijke sturing, kwaliteitsbewaking en conceptontwikkeling over alle kanalen. Je vertaalt actualiteiten naar informatieve artikelen en evergreen how-to content.
* **Je denkt online first**. Je hebt interesse in nieuwe, online contentvormen en hebt zin om daarmee te experimenteren. Je wordt enthousiast van zaken als *user experience*, distributie van content en data.
* **Je bent innovatief**. Je analyseert en optimaliseert de contentstrategie op basis van de doelstellingen. Je bedenkt nieuwe contentformats om professionals beter te ondersteunen in hun dagelijks werk. Hierbij werk je nauw samen met de algemeen hoofredacteur.
* **Je bent nieuwsgierig**. Je volgt het nieuws en de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van veilig en gezond werken op de voet.
* **Je bent een netwerker**. Je bent het gezicht van Arbo in de markt en onderhoudt de contacten met auteurs, experts, verenigingen en stakeholders. Je bouwt het netwerk verder uit en gaat een lezerspanel oprichten.



Je bent verantwoordelijk voor een team bestaande uit 2 vaste medewerkers en enkele freelancers. Naast je coördinerende taken als hoofdredacteur draai je je hand niet om voor wat uitvoerend werk. Idealiter ben je opgeleid als journalist of heb je ervaring met redactiewerk. Je vind het leuk om van tijd tot tijd een artikel te schrijven. Kennis van arbo is handig, maar geen vereiste.



Als hoofdredacteur Arbo ben je onderdeel van de centrale redactie van het ‘professionals portfolio’ van VMN media, waar ook PW., Salarisnet, ORnet en CMweb onderdeel van zijn. Samen zijn we een team van 14 personen.

 **Wat krijg je:**


* **Fijn team** – Leuke, betrokken collega’s die samen mooie content voor de doelgroep maken. Binnen het Arbo-team, maar ook in nauwe samenwerking binnen het professionals portfolio.
* **Hybride werkvorm** – Op donderdag werken we samen op kantoor in Zeist met heerlijke koffie en vers fruit. Dit zijn de momenten dat we als redactie gezamenlijk optrekken, plannen maken en brainstormen. De rest van je tijd deel je zelf in, dus bepaal je ook zelf waar je werkt.
* **Veel ruimte voor nieuwe ideeën** – Als nieuwe hoofdredacteur Arbo krijg je veel ruimte om te experimenteren met goede ideeën. Er ligt een nieuwe contentstrategie, maar ook die kun je nog zelf verder vormgeven.
* **Groei en ontwikkeling** – Arbo is onderdeel van VMN media, B2B-uitgever met ruim 30 merken verdeeld over 16 branches en zo’n 150 journalisten. Zeker 4 keer per jaar is er een redactiedag met workshops van inspirerende sprekers, bijvoorbeeld over SEO, LinkedIn, AI of onderzoeksjournalistiek.
* **Goede arbeidsvoorwaarden** - Een goed salaris op basis van je ervaring, gebaseerd op de CAO voor het Uitgeverijbedrijf. Er zijn uitstekende secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals een persoonlijk keuzebudget met een waarde van 12% van je salaris en een pensioenvoorziening. En niet te vergeten leuke extra’s zoals (digitale) borrels en dart- en tafeltennisfaciliteiten.



Verder nog handig om te weten: het gaat om een functie van 36 uur per week. Het kantoor van VMN media staat in Zeist.
