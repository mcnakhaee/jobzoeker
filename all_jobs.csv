https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=ffae4899aa0d0e69,indeed,Computer Science | Data Science Graduation Internship: Probability Causality Analysis in Complex Systems,ASML,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Asml,"Veldhoven, NB, NL","fulltime, internship",2024-05-03,,,,,False,,,,"**Introduction**
----------------

Are you a master student looking for your graduation project in industry? Is your study related to Computer Science or Data Science in the engineering domain? Do you have proven experience with Data Analytics? This assignment could be interesting for you!


**Background information**
--------------------------

ASML has thousands of lithography machines operating 24/7 at chip factories throughout the world. Due to their extreme accuracy, problems with lithography machines occur quite regularly. Downtime in a high-end chip factory is extremely costly: nominal costs for customers can be $20 per second of unscheduled downtime.  



  

Performance problems on these machines are manually diagnosed mainly by constantly measuring (at sample intervals of minutes/hours/days) thousands of signals generated inside the machine. These signals are collected daily for all ASML machines in the field. In the past, this kind of data has mainly been used by human experts.  



  

The ambition is to transition to structural automated monitoring whereby software helps capture the knowledge of the experts to allow generalists to deal with common failure modes. Some parameters are monitored and can give an indication of the likelihood of the cause. However, several parameters can represent an anomaly and one event can be caused by several causes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a methodology that better covers all these issues and leads to the most probable cause.


**Your assignment**
-------------------

You will analyze and compare methods to determine the probable causality between symptoms and failure mode from a large population of ASML machines in such a way that shift the decision taking from expert to model based. The goal is to find the most effective method.


This helps disseminate knowledge, check “known” assumptions and, where possible, the system should makes unexpected behavior (“strangely enough X leads to Y”) explicit. This helps empirically investigate complex system behavior and discover forgotten or unknown dependencies. We would prefer actual working examples of the techniques/ideas/approaches discussed.


*This position requires access to controlled technology, as defined in the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. § 730, et seq.). Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such controlled technology prior to beginning work. Business demands may require ASML to proceed with candidates who are immediately eligible to access controlled technology.*

**Your profile**
----------------

To be the perfect match for this assignment, you:


* are a master student in Computer Science, Data Science or something related, within the engineering domain;
* have relevant experience in maintenance, Python and data analytics;
* have good communication and analytical skills, a hands-on attitude, and you deal well with uncertainty. Furthermore, you are proactive and you have a good knowledge of English, both written and spoken.
* have a sufficient motivation to work on this assignment. Hence, a cover letter is required.

This assignment is suitable for a master student looking for a graduation assignment. The minimum duration is 6 months, preferably 5 days per week (minimum 3 days on-site). The starting date is September 2024.


*Please note that we can only consider students who are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship.*

**Change the world – one nanometer at a time**
----------------------------------------------

Become an intern at a Dutch company that’s a global industry leader. You’ll gain valuable experience in a highly innovative environment – one that sparks your imagination and creativity. In addition to a monthly internship allowance of maximum €600 (plus a possible housing and free public transport), you’ll get practical guidance from experts in the field and the chance to work in and experience a dynamic team environment.


**ASML - be part of progress**
------------------------------

ASML is a high-tech company headquartered in the Netherlands. We manufacture the complex lithography machines that chipmakers use to produce integrated circuits, or computer chips. What we do is at the heart of all the electronic devices that keep us informed, entertained and connected. Every day, you use electronics that simply wouldn’t exist without our machines.


Behind ASML’s innovations are engineers who think ahead. The people who work at our company include some of the most creative minds in physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, chemistry, mechatronics, optics, mechanical engineering, computer science and fields which are not technical oriented.


We believe we can always do better. We believe the winning idea can come from anyone. We love what we do – not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard.


**Students - getting ready for real-world R&D**
-----------------------------------------------

We’re a global team of more than 40.000 people of 140 different nationalities and counting. Headquartered in Europe’s top tech hub, the Brainport Eindhoven region in the Netherlands, our operations are spread across Europe, Asia and the US.


In such an environment, your colleagues may be sitting next door, or they could be thousands of kilometers away in a different country – or even working for a different company.


An internship at ASML is the opportunity to get to know not only the world of industrial-strength R&D, but yourself – you’ll discover just what excites you most. Will you design a part of the machine, or make sure it gets built to the tightest possible specifications? Will you write software that drives the system to its best performance, or work side-by-side with the engineers of our customers in a fab, optimizing a system to the requirements of the customer?


**Diversity and inclusion**
---------------------------

ASML is an Equal Opportunity Employer that values and respects the importance of a diverse and inclusive workforce. It is the policy of the company to recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. We recognize that diversity and inclusion is a driving force in the success of our company.

**Data Engineer**

  

Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.

  

Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

 **Job Description**

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

  

Till now, teams within DDP have been ingesting the data of the Data Producers into the data platform, supporting the Data Consumers with accessing the data and even creating datasets for them. This is changing in the coming months, where we move towards our new Data Strategy. So, what is the change you might think?

  

Well, as stated Thor is designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers, meaning that Data Producers can onboard their own data in a Self-Service manner, without having a dedicated team within DDP doing this for them. This makes the data flow easier, where a Data Consumers requests the data to the Data Producers, and they ensure it's delivered for them.


Besides ensuring that data ingestion gets easier, DDP is also working on various enablement blocks on the data platform, to make the life of our Consumers easier when it comes to data preparation for data products they work on. You can think of having a standardized package that builds up a DataMart in a few clicks. It is not there yet but soon to come!

  

So, what will be your job…

  

We are looking for Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen. An inhouse self-built engine for creating DataMarts and datasets on top of our self-service data platform Thor.

  

You as a data engineer will join a team of Data Engineers that has been exploring all the options there are in the market concerning the creation of a DataMart.


We have various types of Stakeholders, such as Data Analyst, Data Scientists but also PowerBI users.  

Our aim is to create a DataMart engine which can be deployed across the organization, allowing consumers to have data modelled like they were used to in our old Data Warehouse called Pallas.

  

We finished testing our first two PoC’s earlier this year, which was a success! The DataMart engine is now being worked on to go to Production by the end of quarter 2, 2024 and many use cases are waiting for this to happen.


To be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataMart Engine, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!

  

That is why we need you!

 **Key Responsibilities**

  

* Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation for the DataMart Engine
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Ensure the DataMart is being built in such manner that it’s a (versioned) package we can deliver, as we won’t be owning the DataMart.
* Train others in making right usage of DataMart engine
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting
* Changes of DataKitchen engine version made available via pull mechanism.

  



**Requirements**

  

* >7 years’ work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* Very experienced with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of Data Modelling, Orchestration and Observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience;
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!;
* Flexible working hours;
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy;
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee;
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train;
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year;
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits;
* A company laptop and telephone.

 **Ready to contribute to our mission?**  

Do you want to play an active role in changing the food retail landscape as we know it? Then hop on board and join us on our expedition. Would you like to learn more first, before you apply to Albert Heijn? We’re happy to tell you everything about this vacancy! An assessment might be part of our selection process.

**Introduction**
----------------

Are you a master student looking for your graduation project in industry? Is your study related to Computer Science or Data Science in the engineering domain? Do you have proven experience with Data Analytics? This assignment could be interesting for you!


**Background information**
--------------------------

ASML has thousands of lithography machines operating 24/7 at chip factories throughout the world. Due to their extreme accuracy, problems with lithography machines occur quite regularly. Downtime in a high-end chip factory is extremely costly: nominal costs for customers can be $20 per second of unscheduled downtime.  



  

Performance problems on these machines are manually diagnosed mainly by constantly measuring (at sample intervals of minutes/hours/days) thousands of signals generated inside the machine. These signals are collected daily for all ASML machines in the field. In the past, this kind of data has mainly been used by human experts.  



  

The ambition is to transition to structural automated monitoring whereby software helps capture the knowledge of the experts to allow generalists to deal with common failure modes. Some parameters are monitored and can give an indication of the likelihood of the cause. However, several parameters can represent an anomaly and one event can be caused by several causes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a methodology that better covers all these issues and leads to the most probable cause.


**Your assignment**
-------------------

You will analyze and compare methods to determine the probable causality between symptoms and failure mode from a large population of ASML machines in such a way that shift the decision taking from expert to model based. The goal is to find the most effective method.


This helps disseminate knowledge, check “known” assumptions and, where possible, the system should makes unexpected behavior (“strangely enough X leads to Y”) explicit. This helps empirically investigate complex system behavior and discover forgotten or unknown dependencies. We would prefer actual working examples of the techniques/ideas/approaches discussed.


*This position requires access to controlled technology, as defined in the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. § 730, et seq.). Qualified candidates must be legally authorized to access such controlled technology prior to beginning work. Business demands may require ASML to proceed with candidates who are immediately eligible to access controlled technology.*

**Your profile**
----------------

To be the perfect match for this assignment, you:


* are a master student in Computer Science, Data Science or something related, within the engineering domain;
* have relevant experience in maintenance, Python and data analytics;
* have good communication and analytical skills, a hands-on attitude, and you deal well with uncertainty. Furthermore, you are proactive and you have a good knowledge of English, both written and spoken.
* have a sufficient motivation to work on this assignment. Hence, a cover letter is required.

This assignment is suitable for a master student looking for a graduation assignment. The minimum duration is 6 months, preferably 5 days per week (minimum 3 days on-site). The starting date is September 2024.


*Please note that we can only consider students who are enrolled at a school for the entire duration of the internship.*

**Change the world – one nanometer at a time**
----------------------------------------------

Become an intern at a Dutch company that’s a global industry leader. You’ll gain valuable experience in a highly innovative environment – one that sparks your imagination and creativity. In addition to a monthly internship allowance of maximum €600 (plus a possible housing and free public transport), you’ll get practical guidance from experts in the field and the chance to work in and experience a dynamic team environment.


**ASML - be part of progress**
------------------------------

ASML is a high-tech company headquartered in the Netherlands. We manufacture the complex lithography machines that chipmakers use to produce integrated circuits, or computer chips. What we do is at the heart of all the electronic devices that keep us informed, entertained and connected. Every day, you use electronics that simply wouldn’t exist without our machines.


Behind ASML’s innovations are engineers who think ahead. The people who work at our company include some of the most creative minds in physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, chemistry, mechatronics, optics, mechanical engineering, computer science and fields which are not technical oriented.


We believe we can always do better. We believe the winning idea can come from anyone. We love what we do – not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard.


**Students - getting ready for real-world R&D**
-----------------------------------------------

We’re a global team of more than 40.000 people of 140 different nationalities and counting. Headquartered in Europe’s top tech hub, the Brainport Eindhoven region in the Netherlands, our operations are spread across Europe, Asia and the US.


In such an environment, your colleagues may be sitting next door, or they could be thousands of kilometers away in a different country – or even working for a different company.


An internship at ASML is the opportunity to get to know not only the world of industrial-strength R&D, but yourself – you’ll discover just what excites you most. Will you design a part of the machine, or make sure it gets built to the tightest possible specifications? Will you write software that drives the system to its best performance, or work side-by-side with the engineers of our customers in a fab, optimizing a system to the requirements of the customer?


**Diversity and inclusion**
---------------------------

ASML is an Equal Opportunity Employer that values and respects the importance of a diverse and inclusive workforce. It is the policy of the company to recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles without regard to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

Till now, teams within DDP have been ingesting the data of the Data Producers into the data platform, supporting the Data Consumers with accessing the data and even creating datasets for them. This is changing in the coming months, where we move towards our new Data Strategy. So, what is the change you might think?

  

Well, as stated Thor is designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers, meaning that Data Producers can onboard their own data in a Self-Service manner, without having a dedicated team within DDP doing this for them. This makes the data flow easier, where a Data Consumers requests the data to the Data Producers, and they ensure it's delivered for them.


Besides ensuring that data ingestion gets easier, DDP is also working on various enablement blocks on the data platform, to make the life of our Consumers easier when it comes to data preparation for data products they work on.

We finished testing our first two PoC’s earlier this year, which was a success! The DataMart engine is now being worked on to go to Production by the end of quarter 2, 2024 and many use cases are waiting for this to happen.


To be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataMart Engine, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!

  

That is why we need you!

 **Key Responsibilities**

  

* Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation for the DataMart Engine
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Ensure the DataMart is being built in such manner that it’s a (versioned) package we can deliver, as we won’t be owning the DataMart.
* Train others in making right usage of DataMart engine
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting
* Changes of DataKitchen engine version made available via pull mechanism.

  



**Requirements**

* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of Data Modelling, Orchestration and Observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience;
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!;
* Flexible working hours;
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy;
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee;
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train;

**Data Engineer**


Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.


Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform **suite**, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

 **So, what will be your job…**


We are looking for a Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen (*food and tech pun intended*) that is part of the Thor suite. The DataKitchen is an inhouse self-built framework for transforming conformed and cleansed data (*silver layer*) into DataMarts (*gold layer*) that are directly consumable for analysis and business use.


As a Data Engineer for the DataKitchen, you'll be the master chef behind the scenes, and be challenged with transforming and loading data as efficiently as possible and orchestrating all transformations. You'll also engage in stakeholder management, leveraging the latest cloud technologies to enhance efficiency and automate infrastructure deployment. Of course this all needs to be built in a secure manner and be in line with the data strategy to make DataKitchen as self-service as possible.


Currently we’re using the following tech stack to achieve our vision:

* GIT for version control
* Terraform for infrastructure deployment to Azure (we’re thinking about migrating to OpenTofu)
* GitHub actions for CI/CD
* Delta Lake as storage format
* Python for our codebase
* Databricks as our Lakehouse platform (Spark)
* PySpark for data transformations


But you won't be working alone. You will join a team of Data Engineers that are currently productionizing the first version of the DataKitchen. We expect to go into production by the end of the second quarter this year. However, to be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataKitchen, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!


If you're ready to contribute your expertise to shape the future of data excellence across all brands in Europe and maybe even beyond, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey.

 **Key Responsibilities**

* *Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation of the* ***DataKitchen***
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Train others in making right usage of the **DataKitchen**
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting

 **Requirements**

* **5 or more** years of work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* **Experienced** with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of **data transformation,** **data processing,** data modelling, orchestration and observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and on top of that a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience;
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!;
* Flexible working hours;
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy;
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee;
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train;
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year;
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits;
* A company laptop and telephone

Students: getting ready for real-world R&D
  

We’re a global team of about 39,000 people of 140 different nationalities and counting. Headquartered in Europe’s top tech hub, the Brainport Eindhoven region in the Netherlands, our operations are spread across Europe, Asia and the US.
  

  

In such an environment, your colleagues may be sitting next door, or they could be thousands of kilometers away in a different country – or even working for a different company.
  

  

An internship at ASML is the opportunity to get to know not only the world of industrial-strength R&D, but yourself – you’ll discover just what excites you most. Will you design a part of the machine, or make sure it gets built to the tightest possible specifications? Will you write software that drives the system to its best performance, or work side-by-side with the engineers of our customers in a fab, optimizing a system to the requirements of the customer?


*How will you be part of progress?*

You care deeply about continuous learning, not just by doing it yourself but also by mentoring those around you.


* We approach machine learning solutions as full-stack software development projects and use technologies such as Python, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Keras and Databricks.
* Bringing solutions to production is key, so scalable deployment, model interfacing and model monitoring are important aspects that you will come across.

The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) at the University of Amsterdam is looking for an ambitious and motivated Postdoc in Acoustic Biodiversity Monitoring for a 30-month (2.5 year) position within the European-funded Biodiversa+ project TABMON.  


The central objective of the project TABMON (Towards a Transnational Acoustic Biodiversity MOnitoring Network) is to develop a transnational biodiversity monitoring with autonomous acoustic sensors across a large latitudinal range in Europe, demonstrating how acoustic sensing can complement existing monitoring efforts to fill current gaps in reporting to EU directives and assessing targets of the EU Biodiversity Strategy target. The position is part of an internationally diverse and world-leading team of ecologists, computer scientists, engineers, and stakeholders. It will develop showcases for integrating acoustic observations with traditional monitoring data from structured monitoring schemes, with a focus on Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) of species distributions, population abundance and migration phenology of birds. The showcases will test approaches for model-based data integration with the aim to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

Your work will be embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab of the Theoretical and Computational Ecology Department of IBED. It will involve collaborations with other partners from the Netherlands (e.g. SOVON, CBS Statistics Netherlands, Netherlands Institute of Ecology NIOO-KNAW, University of Tilburg, Naturalis Biodiversity Centre) and abroad (Forest Science and Technology Center of Catalonia in Spain, University of Toulon in France, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research in Norway). It will also connect to other Dutch biodiversity projects such as LTER-LIFE and the biodiversity monitoring demonstration sites of ARISE.  

**What are you going to do?**  


You will integrate acoustic observations from a cutting-edge, high-throughput and fully autonomous acoustic monitoring system called Bugg with data from structured biodiversity monitoring schemes, i.e. conventional surveys with repeatable protocols and/or a stratified sampling design. In this context, you will develop showcases with model-based data integration to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

You will address some of the future needs for EBV workflows as identified by EuropaBON, i.e., developing an autonomous, network-connected, cloud-based, and transnational acoustic biodiversity monitoring system based on EBV workflows with digital sensors and automated end-to-end data streams. The EBV showcases will focus on birds and include improving species distribution data for inconspicuous or night-active species (e.g. harmonizing and integrating different detection probabilities and encounter rates), outlining statistical tools and models to estimate population abundance (e.g. N-mixture models or indices of vocal activities), and quantification of migration phenology (e.g. migrant bird arrival, departure, or intensity of migration). This will provide a basis for near-real time, harmonized and standardized EBV data.  


**Tasks and responsibilities:**
* Handling, assembling and processing large bioacoustic datasets;
* Maintaining bioacoustics sensor deployments and their automated data streams;
* Developing and applying model-based biodiversity data integration tools;
* Statistical modelling of biodiversity data;
* Working with ecologists, computer scientists and stakeholders from research institutes; universities, national parks and NGOs;
* Writing publications in peer-reviewed journals to present the scientific results or developed tools;
* Applying open science principles (e.g. data papers, open source code, metadata specifications).

  


**What do you have to offer?**  


Your experience and profile

The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic (soil and water quality) and biotic factors (ecology and evolution of plants, animals, and microorganisms), and the interplay between those. The IBED vision includes research encompassing experimental and theoretical approaches at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e. from molecules and microorganisms to patterns and processes occurring at the global scale. The University of Amsterdam has excellent high performance computing facilities. Furthermore, IBED has a dedicated computational support team with specialized knowledge of bioinformatics, (geo)database management and scientific programming. IBED also works with non-academic partners to deliver transdisciplinary science for society.  


The position is embedded in the Department of Theoretical and Computational Ecology (TCE) at IBED which focuses on understanding the complexity of ecological systems by using theoretical and advanced computational approaches. A key research focus is to address how organisms cope with changing environmental conditions and how nature and life is distributed across our planet. Within TCE, the position is embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab, a research group which aims to quantify how biodiversity and abiotic components of the Earth system vary across space and time, how they interact, and how responses of species and ecosystems to changing environmental conditions can be predicted and forecasted. The group covers a wide variety of scientific backgrounds, including ecology, data science, conservation science, physical geography, Earth science, and global change biology.

**About us**  


The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic (soil and water quality) and biotic factors (ecology and evolution of plants, animals, and microorganisms), and the interplay between those.  

The IBED vision includes research encompassing experimental and theoretical approaches at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e. from molecules and microorganisms to patterns and processes occurring at the global scale. The University of Amsterdam has excellent high performance computing facilities. Furthermore, IBED has a dedicated computational support team with specialized knowledge of bioinformatics, (geo)database management and scientific programming. IBED also works with non-academic partners to deliver transdisciplinary science for society.  


The position is embedded in the Department of Theoretical and Computational Ecology (TCE) at IBED which focuses on understanding the complexity of ecological systems by using theoretical and advanced computational approaches. A key research focus is to address how organisms cope with changing environmental conditions and how nature and life is distributed across our planet.  

Within TCE, the position is embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab, a research group which aims to quantify how biodiversity and abiotic components of the Earth system vary across space and time, how they interact, and how responses of species and ecosystems to changing environmental conditions can be predicted and forecasted. The group covers a wide variety of scientific backgrounds, including ecology, data science, conservation science, physical geography, Earth science, and global change biology.

**Data Engineer**


Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.


Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform **suite**, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

 **So, what will be your job…**


We are looking for a Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen (*food and tech pun intended*) that is part of the Thor suite. The DataKitchen is an inhouse self-built framework for transforming conformed and cleansed data (*silver layer*) into DataMarts (*gold layer*) that are directly consumable for analysis and business use.


As a Data Engineer for the DataKitchen, you'll be the master chef behind the scenes, and be challenged with transforming and loading data as efficiently as possible and orchestrating all transformations. You'll also engage in stakeholder management, leveraging the latest cloud technologies to enhance efficiency and automate infrastructure deployment. Of course this all needs to be built in a secure manner and be in line with the data strategy to make DataKitchen as self-service as possible.


Currently we’re using the following tech stack to achieve our vision:

* GIT for version control
* Terraform for infrastructure deployment to Azure (we’re thinking about migrating to OpenTofu)
* GitHub actions for CI/CD
* Delta Lake as storage format
* Python for our codebase
* Databricks as our Lakehouse platform (Spark)
* PySpark for data transformations


But you won't be working alone. You will join a team of Data Engineers that are currently productionizing the first version of the DataKitchen. We expect to go into production by the end of the second quarter this year. However, to be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataKitchen, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!


If you're ready to contribute your expertise to shape the future of data excellence across all brands in Europe and maybe even beyond, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey.

 **Key Responsibilities**

* *Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation of the* ***DataKitchen***
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Train others in making right usage of the **DataKitchen**
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting

 **Requirements**

* **5 or more** years of work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* **Experienced** with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of **data transformation,** **data processing,** data modelling, orchestration and observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and on top of that a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!
* Flexible working hours
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits
* A company laptop and telephone

 **Ready to contribute to our mission?**


Do you want to play an active role in changing the food retail landscape as we know it? Then hop on board and join us on our expedition. Would you like to learn more first, before you apply to Albert Heijn? We’re happy to tell you everything about this vacancy! An assessment might be part of our selection process.

Do you have experience with the analysis of acoustic biodiversity monitoring data? Are you interested in integrating data from digital sensors with observations from traditional monitoring methods? Do you enjoy working in an interdisciplinary academic research setting bridging ecology and computer science?  

The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) at the University of Amsterdam is looking for an ambitious and motivated Postdoc in Acoustic Biodiversity Monitoring for a 30-month (2.5 year) position within the European-funded Biodiversa+ project TABMON.  


The central objective of the project TABMON (Towards a Transnational Acoustic Biodiversity MOnitoring Network) is to develop a transnational biodiversity monitoring with autonomous acoustic sensors across a large latitudinal range in Europe, demonstrating how acoustic sensing can complement existing monitoring efforts to fill current gaps in reporting to EU directives and assessing targets of the EU Biodiversity Strategy target. The position is part of an internationally diverse and world-leading team of ecologists, computer scientists, engineers, and stakeholders. It will develop showcases for integrating acoustic observations with traditional monitoring data from structured monitoring schemes, with a focus on Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) of species distributions, population abundance and migration phenology of birds. The showcases will test approaches for model-based data integration with the aim to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

Your work will be embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab of the Theoretical and Computational Ecology Department of IBED. It will involve collaborations with other partners from the Netherlands (e.g. SOVON, CBS Statistics Netherlands, Netherlands Institute of Ecology NIOO-KNAW, University of Tilburg, Naturalis Biodiversity Centre) and abroad (Forest Science and Technology Center of Catalonia in Spain, University of Toulon in France, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research in Norway). It will also connect to other Dutch biodiversity projects such as LTER-LIFE and the biodiversity monitoring demonstration sites of ARISE.  

**What are you going to do?**  


You will integrate acoustic observations from a cutting-edge, high-throughput and fully autonomous acoustic monitoring system called Bugg with data from structured biodiversity monitoring schemes, i.e. conventional surveys with repeatable protocols and/or a stratified sampling design. In this context, you will develop showcases with model-based data integration to demonstrate how acoustic observations can complement existing monitoring schemes and how current data gaps can be filled.  

You will address some of the future needs for EBV workflows as identified by EuropaBON, i.e., developing an autonomous, network-connected, cloud-based, and transnational acoustic biodiversity monitoring system based on EBV workflows with digital sensors and automated end-to-end data streams. The EBV showcases will focus on birds and include improving species distribution data for inconspicuous or night-active species (e.g. harmonizing and integrating different detection probabilities and encounter rates), outlining statistical tools and models to estimate population abundance (e.g. N-mixture models or indices of vocal activities), and quantification of migration phenology (e.g. migrant bird arrival, departure, or intensity of migration). This will provide a basis for near-real time, harmonized and standardized EBV data.

**About us**  


The University of Amsterdam is the Netherlands' largest university, offering the widest range of academic programmes. At the UvA, 30,000 students, 6,000 staff members and 3,000 PhD candidates study and work in a diverse range of fields, connected by a culture of curiosity.  


The Faculty of Science has a student body of around 8,000, as well as 1,800 members of staff working in education, research or support services. Researchers and students at the Faculty of Science are fascinated by every aspect of how the world works, be it elementary particles, the birth of the universe or the functioning of the brain.  


The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is one of eight research institutes of the Faculty of Science at the University of Amsterdam. The research at IBED aims to unravel how ecosystems function in all their complexity, and how they change due to natural processes and human activities. At its core lies an integrated systems approach to study biodiversity, ecosystems and the environment. IBED adopts this systems approach to ecosystems, addressing abiotic (soil and water quality) and biotic factors (ecology and evolution of plants, animals, and microorganisms), and the interplay between those. The IBED vision includes research encompassing experimental and theoretical approaches at a wide variety of temporal and spatial scales, i.e. from molecules and microorganisms to patterns and processes occurring at the global scale. The University of Amsterdam has excellent high performance computing facilities. Furthermore, IBED has a dedicated computational support team with specialized knowledge of bioinformatics, (geo)database management and scientific programming. IBED also works with non-academic partners to deliver transdisciplinary science for society.  


The position is embedded in the Department of Theoretical and Computational Ecology (TCE) at IBED which focuses on understanding the complexity of ecological systems by using theoretical and advanced computational approaches. A key research focus is to address how organisms cope with changing environmental conditions and how nature and life is distributed across our planet. Within TCE, the position is embedded in the Biogeography & Macroecology (BIOMAC) lab, a research group which aims to quantify how biodiversity and abiotic components of the Earth system vary across space and time, how they interact, and how responses of species and ecosystems to changing environmental conditions can be predicted and forecasted. The group covers a wide variety of scientific backgrounds, including ecology, data science, conservation science, physical geography, Earth science, and global change biology.

**Data Engineer**


Albert Heijn is a renowned supermarket chain that has been serving customers across the Netherlands for over 135 years. Founded in 1887 by Albert Heijn, the company has grown to become one of the most trusted and beloved grocery retailers in the country. With a commitment to quality, convenience, and customer satisfaction, Albert Heijn has become an integral part of the Dutch community's daily lives.


Albert Heijn is accelerating in becoming a Food and Tech Company. That is where AH Technology comes into the picture. With a focus on Data, Digital and Tech, we at Albert Heijn strive to deliver high quality products where technology plays an important role.

  

Part of AH Technology is the Data Differentiation Platform (DDP), where we support the Cloud Services and Data Management within Albert Heijn and deliver THE groundbreaking self-service data platform **suite**, called Thor, designed to empower Data Producers and Data Consumers.


With Thor, the process of data ingestion, transformation, and utilization becomes seamless, enabling users to unlock the full potential of their data while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, including handling sensitive information like PII (Personally Identifiable Information).

 **So, what will be your job…**


We are looking for a Data Engineer who can help with the creation of our so called DataKitchen (*food and tech pun intended*) that is part of the Thor suite. The DataKitchen is an inhouse self-built framework for transforming conformed and cleansed data (*silver layer*) into DataMarts (*gold layer*) that are directly consumable for analysis and business use.


As a Data Engineer for the DataKitchen, you'll be the master chef behind the scenes, and be challenged with transforming and loading data as efficiently as possible and orchestrating all transformations. You'll also engage in stakeholder management, leveraging the latest cloud technologies to enhance efficiency and automate infrastructure deployment. Of course this all needs to be built in a secure manner and be in line with the data strategy to make DataKitchen as self-service as possible.


Currently we’re using the following tech stack to achieve our vision:

* GIT for version control
* Terraform for infrastructure deployment to Azure (we’re thinking about migrating to OpenTofu)
* GitHub actions for CI/CD
* Delta Lake as storage format
* Python for our codebase
* Databricks as our Lakehouse platform (Spark)
* PySpark for data transformations


But you won't be working alone. You will join a team of Data Engineers that are currently productionizing the first version of the DataKitchen. We expect to go into production by the end of the second quarter this year. However, to be able to scale, add additional features and support our DataKitchen, we need to grow our team. Ensuring we have a stable and mature team that can work towards the future, having our DataKitchen being used in all brands across Europe and maybe even beyond!


If you're ready to contribute your expertise to shape the future of data excellence across all brands in Europe and maybe even beyond, we invite you to join us on this exciting journey.

 **Key Responsibilities**

* *Work closely together with the DataKitchen Data Engineers in expanding the foundation of the* ***DataKitchen***
* Support the Product Owner with stakeholder management
* Train others in making right usage of the **DataKitchen**
* Ensure alignment with architecture and data strategy is there at all times
* Keep building the product in a scalable and cost effective manner
* Ensure the product meets all security guidelines
* Implement observability with proactive monitoring/alerting

 **Requirements**

* **5 or more** years of work experience as a Data Engineer
* Experience with Cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure)
* Experienced with Databricks
* **Experienced** with Python/SQL/PySpark
* Experienced in running bigger projects and scaling them
* Understanding concepts of **data transformation,** **data processing,** data modelling, orchestration and observability
* Strong communication and teamwork skills, with the ability to effectively collaborate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Lives in Netherlands and can work from Zaandam office minimum 2 days a week, more if required

 **What we offer**  

At Albert Heijn we aim to grow, and this is only possible if you grow along with us. As we work together to build our brand and your career, you can count on (based on 40 hours per week):

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and on top of that a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience
* A minimum of 20 days paid vacation, optionally 12.5 days extra. Do you want to take that extra time off, or would you rather convert the extra days into discounts or sell them for cash? You’re the end boss!
* Flexible working hours
* Access to a challenging training curriculum – AH Tech Academy
* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee
* A travel allowance or a NS-business card for traveling to and from Zaandam by train
* 10% staff discount on groceries in all Albert Heijn stores, to a maximum of €300 per year
* A free Mijn Albert Heijn Premium membership with many benefits
* A company laptop and telephone

 **Ready to contribute to our mission?**


Do you want to play an active role in changing the food retail landscape as we know it? Then hop on board and join us on our expedition. Would you like to learn more first, before you apply to Albert Heijn? We’re happy to tell you everything about this vacancy! An assessment might be part of our selection process.

 ***About Quatt***  

*Quatt is an ambitious scaleup that was founded in 2021 by two entrepreneurs and brothers from the Netherlands. Our goal is to accelerate the transition to sustainable heating in the Netherlands and abroad. Our first product is a smart, hybrid heat pump for the Dutch market.*  

*The Dutch government is strongly incentivizing 8 million homeowners to get rid of natural gas and start heating sustainably within the next few decades. Unfortunately, the current pace of heat pump installations is far too low. Therefore, Quatt is improving the overall customer experience, adding smart control software, simplifying the installation job and, last but not least, greatly enhancing the aesthetics. By doing so, we want to increase adoption by an order of magnitude.*  

*We are developing a highly advanced control system based on several AI technologies, like Machine learning and Deep learning. This system enables us to operate our heat pumps, in conjunction with already installed natural gas heaters, in the most cost- or energy-efficient way, at any given day. We estimate this can reduce heating costs by about 20%. By combining this with D2C sales & installation, Quatt is aiming to reach a payback time of 3-4 years; and thus a very quick uplift in sales.*

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website.

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student.

The Tytgat group is focusing on translating findings from fundamental research to the clinic and specifically on identifying biomarkers in liquid biopsies.


**Position overview**



As a bioinformatician at the Tytgat group, you’ll be involved in projects that tests cell free DNA (cfDNA) through different platforms, such as sequencing and digital droplet PCR, with the goal to identify tumor driven aberrations that could be translated into the clinic for the development of precision medicine in pediatric cancer. Within this project, we are seeking for a highly motivated bioinformatician to develop and optimize computational systems and bioinformatics pipelines to detect genetic aberrations, mutational and DNA methylation patterns in cfDNA from various pediatric cancers, in particular kidney, sarcoma and neuroblastoma tumors. The candidate will have the opportunity to work in a highly interactive environment with projects involving different aspects of clinical research, access to high-performance computing environment, highly automated analytical pipelines and teamwork with scientists who have deep experience in data analysis, data management and delivery of high-quality results.


**Responsibilities**


* The bioinformatician will integrate and work with high-throughput sequencing data, such as whole exome sequencing (WES), gene panel sequencing, shallow whole genome sequencing (shWGS) and DNA methylation from tumor DNA as well as cfDNA from liquid biopsies.
* The candidate will be introduced to the WES/WGS pipelines of tumor DNA that are performed in a diagnostic setting at the Princess Maxima Centre. He/She will optimize these pipelines for liquid biopsy analyses. The comparable liquid biopsy pipeline will allow us to cross check different aberrations in the tumor DNA and cfDNA from the same patient to study the tumor heterogeneity, response to therapy, and early detection of relapse.
* The candidate will work closely with our collaborators from the bioinformatics group and Big Data Core facility, Dr. Patrick Kemmeren and Dr. Jayne Hehir-Kwa.


Candidates with a strong interest in oncology and pediatric cancers, and background in computational biology or bioinformatics are encouraged to apply. Having experience on liquid biopsy sequencing approaches is a big plus. The successful candidate will also have an opportunity to participate in research projects involved in the analysis of the cell free reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (cf-RRBS), identification of breakpoints in structural variants from WGS data, and Nanopore sequencing of liquid biopsies. Experience with developing and running sequencing pipelines, data analysis using R or Python and familiarity with linux/unix is required. Experience and knowledge in databases is also highly desirable.


**Requirements**


* Master or PhD in bioinformatics or similar experience in bioinformatics, computational biology, computer science or similar
* 3 years of relevant experience
* Excellent programming skills, preferably in R (familiarity with Rshiny is a plus), Python, and Unix
* Experience in analyzing NGS data, statistics, working in a high performance computing (HPC) environment
* Experience in working with high-throughput data sets and different variant calling tools (e.g. GATK, MANTA, FREEC, etc.) for single nucleotide variants, copy number aberration, structural variants, and methylation patterns
* Versatile team player able to work in a cross-disciplinary team and dynamic environment.
* Knowledge in biological sciences e.g. genomics, genetics, and transcriptomics is preferred.
* Excellent written and oral presentation skills in English.

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).

We are GNT, an ambitious and innovative family-run business with a colorful character! With our EXBERRY® brand, we are the market leader in the field of Coloring Foods. Our colorings are 100% natural and are made from fruits, vegetables and plants. We are world champions when it comes to utilizing the bounty of nature and strive to continuously innovate and improve natural color ingredients for the consumer. By carefully preserving all of nature’s beauty and goodness, we are able to offer our clients the highest quality and most reliable products. In the future, we also want to offer the most sustainable on the market. This is what continues to motivate us every day!

The most important ingredients for GNT’s success are our employees and the cooperation that exists between them. We believe in teamwork and we are there for one another, our clients, our suppliers and our partners. That is what makes us GNT.

*Due to the strong growth of our organization, we are looking for:*

**Student – Development Support of R and Shiny Apps** 

Within GNT we produce natural food colorants from various vegetables. In general, the first process step is a water extraction of the vegetable, followed by several refining and concentration steps. Typical unit operations are microfiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, evaporation but there are many more. The resulting concentrates are semifinished products, which are stored in warehouses. As a final step, the concentrates are mixed and finetuned according to specification, filled in containers and shipped to customers. These processes are monitored intensively by inline and out-of-line measurements, to assure optimal performance.

**The role:** 

To empower our employees to take better decisions in their daily work, we are increasingly collecting, aggregating and storing KPI data. The KPI data are shown in tailor-made apps, written in R using the shiny package. The apps run in a Docker environment. To speed up our app development we are looking for students who can support us with a wide variety of tasks, ranging from a few hours to several days.

Some examples of tasks on our backlog:

* Many minor fixes, such as displaying time in the correct time zone instead of UTC, making hover labels in Plotly visualizations more user-friendly, fetching additional information from databases to add to certain views, enriching Plotly elements so that links can also be opened by clicking on data points, merging several apps written according to the same template (see also point B), and many other minor adjustments/improvements.
* There is a ""template app"" for a specific group of visualization apps. We would like to convert this template into a package (for internal use), including documentation and automated tests.
* Writing specific R shiny modules to display specific visualizations. These modules can then be called from the ""template app"", which makes it simple to deploy and re-use.
* Creating a template app for another type of visualizations and also turning it into a package.
* Resolving a performance issue in one of the apps. We will likely need to make a different choice/development regarding the ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) for this app.
* Adjusting the Docker environment for more stable performance.

**About you, as our ideal student:** 

* You should already be able to program in R.
* Experience with the shiny package is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of databases (especially SQL Server) is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of Docker is a plus but not required.

If the applicant knows other languages, such as python or C++, this is a great foundation to learn R. We can suggest online learning materials, that we have found to be very useful.

**What do we find important?** 

The GNT values are the basis of our daily activities. That’s why we think it’s important that we fit together. GNT employs people who are enterprising and take responsibility. Customer and service orientation is of course paramount! We always take that extra step to offer our external and internal customers the best service. In addition, we do everything we do as sustainably as possible. We are open and honest with each other and bring out the best in each other.

**What do we offer you?** 

* A full-time gross hourly wage between €12 and €18 gross per hour, depending on your age, knowledge and experience.
* A job next to your study for 4 - 16 hours per week, if you are available for more hours that is also possible.
* A modern working environment with ambitious developers, with whom you can always spar about the latest technologies.
* We find sustainability very important. That is why we compensate - as part of our terms of employment - your carbon footprint.
* A great workplace at a successful and innovative company: GNT is on the move and so will you!

**We color the world, so do you?**

Does this vacancy suit you? Please send your motivation, cv, annual earliest possible start date to wvhelvoort@gnt-group.com. You will soon find out if you will be invited for an introductory meeting (in Mierlo).

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).


**Diversity**  

At the Faculty of Science we value inclusiveness and strive for a diverse community with equal opportunities for all. We give full support to our staff in achieving their potential to become independent academic researchers and teachers. For more information about our policy on diversity and equality please go to the diversity page on our website.

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).

We are GNT, an ambitious and innovative family-run business with a colorful character! With our EXBERRY® brand, we are the market leader in the field of Coloring Foods. Our colorings are 100% natural and are made from fruits, vegetables and plants. We are world champions when it comes to utilizing the bounty of nature and strive to continuously innovate and improve natural color ingredients for the consumer. By carefully preserving all of nature’s beauty and goodness, we are able to offer our clients the highest quality and most reliable products. In the future, we also want to offer the most sustainable on the market. This is what continues to motivate us every day!

The most important ingredients for GNT’s success are our employees and the cooperation that exists between them. We believe in teamwork and we are there for one another, our clients, our suppliers and our partners. That is what makes us GNT.

*Due to the strong growth of our organization, we are looking for:*

**Student – Development Support of R and Shiny Apps** 

Within GNT we produce natural food colorants from various vegetables. In general, the first process step is a water extraction of the vegetable, followed by several refining and concentration steps. Typical unit operations are microfiltration, ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, evaporation but there are many more. The resulting concentrates are semifinished products, which are stored in warehouses. As a final step, the concentrates are mixed and finetuned according to specification, filled in containers and shipped to customers. These processes are monitored intensively by inline and out-of-line measurements, to assure optimal performance.

**The role:** 

To empower our employees to take better decisions in their daily work, we are increasingly collecting, aggregating and storing KPI data. The KPI data are shown in tailor-made apps, written in R using the shiny package. The apps run in a Docker environment. To speed up our app development we are looking for students who can support us with a wide variety of tasks, ranging from a few hours to several days.

Some examples of tasks on our backlog:

* Many minor fixes, such as displaying time in the correct time zone instead of UTC, making hover labels in Plotly visualizations more user-friendly, fetching additional information from databases to add to certain views, enriching Plotly elements so that links can also be opened by clicking on data points, merging several apps written according to the same template (see also point B), and many other minor adjustments/improvements.
* There is a ""template app"" for a specific group of visualization apps. We would like to convert this template into a package (for internal use), including documentation and automated tests.
* Writing specific R shiny modules to display specific visualizations. These modules can then be called from the ""template app"", which makes it simple to deploy and re-use.
* Creating a template app for another type of visualizations and also turning it into a package.
* Resolving a performance issue in one of the apps. We will likely need to make a different choice/development regarding the ETL (Extract - Transform - Load) for this app.
* Adjusting the Docker environment for more stable performance.

**About you, as our ideal student:** 

* You should already be able to program in R.
* Experience with the shiny package is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of databases (especially SQL Server) is a plus but not required.
* Knowledge of Docker is a plus but not required.

If the applicant knows other languages, such as python or C++, this is a great foundation to learn R. We can suggest online learning materials, that we have found to be very useful.

**What do we find important?** 

The GNT values are the basis of our daily activities. That’s why we think it’s important that we fit together. GNT employs people who are enterprising and take responsibility. Customer and service orientation is of course paramount! We always take that extra step to offer our external and internal customers the best service. In addition, we do everything we do as sustainably as possible. We are open and honest with each other and bring out the best in each other.

**What do we offer you?** 

* A full-time gross hourly wage between €12 and €18 gross per hour, depending on your age, knowledge and experience.
* A job next to your study for 4 - 16 hours per week, if you are available for more hours that is also possible.
* A modern working environment with ambitious developers, with whom you can always spar about the latest technologies.
* We find sustainability very important. That is why we compensate - as part of our terms of employment - your carbon footprint.
* A great workplace at a successful and innovative company: GNT is on the move and so will you!

**We color the world, so do you?**

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

  

**Research at our Institute/Faculty**  

Leiden University is situated between Amsterdam (36km) and Den Haag (15 km) and was founded in 1575, making it the oldest university in the Netherlands. It houses around 35,000 students originating from 112 nationalities, facilitated by approximately 8,000 staff. The Faculty of Science is a world-class faculty where staff and students work together in a dynamic international environment. It is a faculty where personal and academic development are top priorities. Our people are driven by curiosity to expand fundamental knowledge and to look beyond the borders of their own discipline; their aim is to benefit science, and to make a contribution to addressing the major societal challenges of the future.


The research carried out at the Faculty is very diverse, ranging from mathematics, information science, astronomy, physics, chemistry and bio-pharmaceutical sciences to biology and environmental sciences. The research activities are organised in eight institutes. These institutes offer eight bachelor’s and twelve master’s programmes. The faculty has grown strongly in recent years and now has more than 2,300 staff and almost 5,000 students. We are located at the heart of Leiden’s Bio Science Park, one of Europe’s biggest science parks, where university and business life come together.


The environmental science research in CML is organized around two major research areas: ‘Industrial Ecology’ and ‘Environmental Biology’. This makes CML one of the few institutes covering both the circular, sustainable economic use of natural resources and natural capital, as well as assessing the environmental impacts of economic activities on natural resources, biodiversity and natural capital. Presently, over 140 FTE (including postdocs and PhDs) are employed at CML. CML collaborates with the TU Delft and Erasmus University (Rotterdam) in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Sustainability (LDE-CfS).

**Terms and conditions**  

At Leiden University, a postdoctoral research is seen as an employee rather than a student. As such, we offer a 1-year position with the possibility of extension to 3 years based on performance and following the pay scale 10 in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Salary ranges from € 3.226,00 and € 5.090,00 gross per month based on a full-time position. Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses, we have set up a dual career programme. Candidates from outside the Netherlands may be eligible for a substantial tax break (“30% rule”).

The Faculty of Science and Institute of Environmental Sciences are looking for:

**1 Postdoctoral researcher related to applying landscape models to the evolutionary ecology and invasion trajectory of amphibians**


Vacancy number: 14891


**Key responsibilities**  

Are you a curious scientist, wanting to bridge evolutionary ecology questions to environmental science applications? Does combining landscape models with real-world data, and interfacing with policy decision-makers for conservation applications pique your interest? Do you have experience with using environmental DNA (eDNA) or have a desire to learn and apply this approach in aquatic systems to help stem biodiversity loss? If so, the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher who has experience and an affinity with applying landscape modelling methods to study questions relating to invasive species (mainly Triturus spp. amphibians but possibly also Salmonid fish), conservation, and evolutionary dynamics. We are particularly interested in candidates familiar with Species Distribution Models (SDMs), evolutionary ecology theory (e.g., speciation, hybridization) and if possible (but not required) environmental DNA (or eDNA).

  

Specifically, the postdoctoral researcher will look at applying modelling methods to (already collected) genetic data to track and predict hybridization and invasion dynamics. Specifically, we are looking for someone to integrate eDNA data into landscape genetic frameworks to understand genetic connectivity of populations across the composition of the landscape, and how this influences hybridization and invasion potential. The Postdoc will investigate whether landscape features, such as waterbody fragmentation or elevation (e.g. with LiDAR and GIS) promote or hinder invasive species spread and potentially hybridization. For SDMs, the postdoc will be expected to overlay biotic and abiotic covariate data for different species for forecasting distributional trajectories. With these projects, we aim to deliver critical information needed for meaningful conservation recovery strategies.

  

The postdoctoral research will work closely with PhD candidates collecting genetic data through field work, and will be expected to work in a large research group comprised of 3-4 PhD students and numerous master’s students. These projects are a part of a Nationally funded research program that links many collaborators across two continents (Europe and N. America) and numerous academic institutions, private enterprises, and NGOs, ultimately offering a unique, large, and dynamic research network. Within the network, the candidate will be expected to liaise with others and potentially travel to various countries across Europe and North America.


The postdoctoral research will become a member in the laboratory of Dr. Stewart whose research has been fully funded through the Dutch VIDI program. As such you will work closely alongside a similarly funded PhD candidate and be expected to offer some degree of mentorship. This collaboration may also see the postdoc doing some fieldwork if wished. Funding for this position also offers the postdoctoral researcher the ability to attend multiple national and international conferences. Dr. Stewart is dedicated to an inclusive and open research environment to promote passion, independence, and transferable skills for whatever future career goals the candidate may have. In our research group, we strongly value a collaborative approach. Researchers will enter an environment of weekly informal meetings to promote progress and cohesion within the larger research group, while also engaging with the larger e3DNA working group (e3DNA.com; the Dutch eDNA research hub hosted by Dr. Stewart and Dr. Trimbos at Leiden University) that meets twice a month.


If you are an interdisciplinary thinker with a PhD degree in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science (or a related field), this postdoctoral position might be a great fit for you.


**You are expected to:**

* Be a collegial person but have a proactive attitude towards balancing your research endeavors
* Contribute to a dynamic research group involved in genetic, ecological and evolutionary analysis both within our institute but also with project collaborators in other countries
* Be comfortable and confident working independently when required
* Be comfortable supervising BSc or MSc students for thesis projects
* Contribute to a mentorship role for PhD candidates
* Attend national and international conferences
* Work with supervisors outlining research methodologies and proposals
* Stimulate students’ collaborative and pro-active attitudes

**Selection criteria:**  

The preferred candidate

* Has at least a PhD degree, ideally in Evolutionary or Molecular Ecology, Biology, Sustainability, Environmental Science or a related discipline
* Proven ability to motivate and/or encourage students and to coach them through group work
* Has excellent organization and communication skills (e.g., as evidenced through publications and presentations at conferences)
* Demonstrable proactive and flexible attitude
* Has experience with molecular data and applying landscape modelling frameworks (e.g. SDMs)
* Particular strengths with Machine Learning or Deep Learning approaches
* Strong data management, visualization, and scripting skills (e.g. in R, Python, or other) are a prerequisite. Your previous degrees ideally involves landscape modelling related research
* You are a team player, and can communicate your work to other researchers of various disciplines within and outside of the CML
* Fluent in English, verbally and in writing

These solutions will not be a one-off case, they must have a customizable approach, so they can be easily used in different business processes and operational situations and communicate and integrate with other systems. How would you do that? Try by combining conventional computer vision with Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence to verify images and documents, bring out the gaps, pre-alert operation to fill up the gaps, preventing an engineering problem and also providing predictive mechanisms to preempt the problem in advance.

**Responsibilities:**

* Identifying best approach to sourcing images to be processed
* Performing analysis of available tools, libraries and algorithms to determine best solution approach
* Design an interface for the proposed solutions, so they can be integrated and communicate with other systems
* Provide an evaluation of accuracy and quality of the proposed solution(s)
* Implement a working Proof-of-Concept solution for each business case
* Working with software engineers and business representatives to identify solution improvement opportunities, propose system modifications and develop the modifications.

**This position requires one or more of the following technical or business skills:**

* Proficiency in computer vision tools and algorithms.
* Strong mathematical skills to help collect, measure, organize and analyse data
* Knowledge of programming languages like SQL, Oracle, R, MATLAB, Java, and Python

Energy systems are becoming more decentralized while there is increasing demand for electricity, creating growing vulnerabilities such as grid congestion and cybersecurity risks. It is therefore urgent to ensure a more resilient electricity grid.  

  

To tackle this challenge, at technical level, there is need to design resilient operation strategies with fluctuating renewable generation, and to learn how to make system-level detection and prediction of malfunctions or cyber-attacks in power networks. From a socioeconomic and spatial perspective, there is need to create resilient market design and economic incentives, such as considering dynamic pricing, energy sharing and trading, stakeholders’ distribution of costs and benefits, and spatial differences.  

  

In this project, a resilience assessment framework for electricity grids will first be developed, building on resilience theory and interdisciplinary methods in ecology and economics (e.g., the five Ws). Since energy systems can be modeled as networked systems, we will employ spatial and network analysis; where nodes represent components like substations and consumers, edges represent connections between them such as transmission lines, and network metrics can be used to identify critical components in the systems. Network failure or simulated attacks on nodes/edges could allow to prevent disruptions and identify potential vulnerabilities. A digital-twin approach will be employed to simulate various scenarios, including for example, peak load, component failures, attacks, and renewable energy fluctuations. The approach will empower optimal design for greater resilience of the energy system by improving our understanding and evaluating the vulnerability and the effectiveness of different strategies.  

  

In your position as a PhD researcher, you will:* critically review existing resilience–electricity grid literature and develop a comprehensive resilience assessment framework for the electricity grid.
* develop network models and conduct spatial and network analysis to assess the resilience of the system (electricity grid(s)).
* use a digital-twin approach to simulate various scenarios such as cyber-attacks and renewable energy fluctuations.
* analyze different strategies for facilitating a more resilient grid, such as local energy and flexibility market design.


**You will work here**

Bij HDSR werken we samen aan schoon en voldoende water. Goede informatie vormt de basis van ons werk. Op basis van jouw ordening en analyse van data en tijdreeksen kunnen wij zorgen voor een goed functionerend watersysteem.


Als Databeheerder Monitoring Waterkwantiteit en Waterkwaliteit zorg je ervoor dat de ruwe data wordt omgezet in betrouwbare en relevante waterinformatie. Dit doen wij voor interne vraagstukken, maar ook voor die van inwoners van ons gebied. Een voorbeeld hiervan is een agrariër die meer inzicht wil krijgen in de werking van een stuw. Die kan nu op ons Open Water Data-portaal opzoeken of hij voldoende water heeft in tijden van droogte en geen wateroverlast krijgt tijdens hevige neerslag. Jij verzamelt data, monitort dit, maakt het inzichtelijk en ontsluit het via webservices. Daarbij zijn de historische tijdreeksen in de FEWS-datasystemen essentieel. Het waterbeheer in ons gebied is uitdagend door de diversiteit aan bodemtypes (veen, klei, zand). Dit maakt jouw werk afwisselend bij de beoordeling van de datakwaliteit.


Hier komt uiteraard nog meer bij kijken:


* Beheren van (webgebaseerde) datakoppelingen met externe en interne partijen.
* Configureren van meetpunten, (sub)parameters, validatieregels, visualisatie en exports.
* Toezien op wijzigingen in FEWS-configuratie door een externe partij.
* In samenwerking met bronhouders oplossen van problemen rondom imports.
* Op elkaar afstemmen van databeheer van monitoring waterkwaliteit en -kwantiteit.
* Beheren van scripts voor conversie en consistentie-checks met het oog op datakwaliteit.
* Helpen bij inrichten van gebruiker-specifieke kanalen voor hun informatiebehoefte.
* Documenteren van onderbouwing van gemaakte keuzes in het databeheer.
* Uitleg geven aan collega’s over de data en werking van FEWS als databeheersysteem.


**In dit team kom je te werken**
--------------------------------


Jij bent als Databeheerder onderdeel van het team Informatie en Kennis. Een team met ongeveer 35 professionals op het gebied hydrologie, ecologie, waterkwaliteit en waterkwantiteit, inclusief bijkomende monitoring en databeheer. Als team geven wij advies bij vragen vanuit beheer, beleid, programma’s en projecten. Wij zijn ook regelmatig actief buiten HDSR om samen met andere waterschappen, kennisinstellingen en landelijke samenwerkingsverbanden kennis te delen en innovaties verder te brengen in de praktijk. We zijn een hecht en gedreven team dat altijd open staat voor nieuwe ideeën en kennis. Zo leren we met en van elkaar en blijven we groeien.

---------------------------


Wij vinden het belangrijk om je een fijne werkplek te bieden. We hebben een informele werksfeer in een platte structuur met veel betrokken collega’s die voor je klaarstaan. Daarnaast kun je rekenen op:

Dit salaris is opgebouwd uit een bruto basissalaris van maximaal € 5.271,- (schaal 10 cao waterschappen), en een Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB) van 21% (inclusief 8% vakantiegeld). Je kunt zelf bepalen hoe je jouw IKB-budget inzet. Je kunt er extra vakantiedagen van opnemen of het maandelijks laten uitbetalen;
* je krijgt een laptop en een smartphone en bovendien een vergoeding van € 3,- netto per thuiswerkdag plus een vergoeding van maximaal € 850,- om je thuiswerkplek in te richten;
* voor jouw groei en ontwikkeling krijg je ook nog een persoonlijk budget van € 6.000,- om te besteden aan opleidingen, cursussen, trainingen en vitaliteit;
* reiskostenvergoeding en een fijne werkplek die goed bereikbaar is met het openbaar vervoer;
* een goede pensioenregeling;
* je krijgt een arbeidsovereenkomst voor de duur van een jaar met uitzicht op een vast contract.


**Wat maakt jou succesvol?**
----------------------------


Als Databeheerder Monitoring Waterkwantiteit en Waterkwaliteit ga je secuur te werk. Je houdt het overzicht, weet realistisch te plannen en legt jouw werk helder vast. Dankzij jouw communicatieve vaardigheden kun je jouw collega’s goed adviseren en jouw bevindingen uitdragen. Je luistert actief en durft door te vragen. Met jouw analytisch inzicht kun je goed verbanden leggen. Maar ook snel schakelen in denkniveau en aanpak.


Verder beschik je over:

Je werkt aan opdrachten vanuit de Rijksoverheid, provincies, gemeenten en de Europese Unie. Je geeft een nieuwe impuls aan reeds bestaande onderzoeken door het ontwikkelen van (ruimtelijke) modellen, het analyseren van complexe datasets en het vertalen van kennis in handzame tools. Ook draag je bij aan wetenschappelijke rapportages en adviezen.



Je dagelijks werk is afwisselend en zal in ieder geval bestaan uit:


* Vertalen van nieuwe biodiversiteitskennis in ecosysteemdiensten die concrete handvatten geven voor duurzamer land- en ecosysteemgebruik;
* Het ontwikkelen van ruimtelijke modellen, uitvoeren van modelberekeningen en het interpreteren van de uitkomsten;
* Tool-ontwikkeling om kennis in te zetten voor de uitvoeringspraktijk;
* Het verzamelen, interpreteren en beheren van ecologische data en biodiversiteit-data;

* Het presenteren en toelichten van de resultaten bij de opdrachtgevers en op congressen is ook onderdeel van je werk.
* Je werkt in een gemotiveerde en multi-disciplinaire afdeling van 25 collega’s met toonaangevende kennis op het gebied van bodem en ondergrond, water en drinkwater, ecotoxicologie en ecosysteemdiensten.


Uniek aan deze baan  

In deze functie draag je concreet bij aan het belang van biodiversiteit en ecosysteemdiensten voor de samenleving. Je komt te werken in het centrum Duurzaamheid, Milieu en Gezondheid. De onderwerpen waar het centrum aan werkt zijn actueel en de thema’s van ons werk zie je bijna wekelijks in het nieuws terug. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan de transitie van landbouw en natuur, PFAS, Ultra fijn stof (verkeer, luchtvaart) of windenergie en gezondheid. Binnen het RIVM krijg je de kans om als bevlogen inhoudelijk expert te floreren, jouw inbreng wordt gehoord én gewaardeerd.



De afdeling  

Bij het RIVM werken we met ruim 2500 collega’s elke dag samen aan de zorg voor morgen. Je komt bij ons terecht op de afdeling Duurzame Bodem, Drinkwater en Biodiversiteit. Wij doen onderzoek naar de kwaliteit van natuurlijke hulpbronnen, biodiversiteit en ecosysteemdiensten. Denk hierbij aan de ondergrond, die een cruciale rol speelt voor de drinkwater- en voedselproductie. Of aan groen in de stad voor een gezonde leefomgeving en verkoeling bij hittestress. Deze ecosysteemdiensten zijn niet oneindig, worden vaak bedreigd en er moet dus duurzaam mee worden omgesprongen. Wij geven inzicht in de betekenis van ecosysteemdiensten voor maatschappelijke opgaves zoals klimaatverandering, verduurzaming van de landbouw, de woningbouw en een gezonde leefomgeving.

Wil je bijdragen aan het herstel van ecosystemen en biodiversiteit? En vind je het leuk om te werken met complexe datasets en modellen? Solliciteer dan en zorg samen met ons dat we kennis over ecologie en biodiversiteit kunnen toepassen voor het milieubeleid.



Doel van de functie  

Jij brengt ecologische kennis om de bodem- en waterkwaliteit te verbeteren. Je onderzoekt hoe we een vitale bodem kunnen krijgen en behouden. Hoe goed presterende ecosysteemdiensten kunnen bijdragen aan de oplossing van maatschappelijke opgaven, zoals verduurzaming van de landbouw, klimaatmitigatie en -adaptatie, natuur- en biodiversiteitsherstel en aan de kwaliteit van het bodem-watersysteem. Je vergroot het inzicht over de potentie van ecosystemen in bodemherstel en ontwikkeling daarin.



Je werkt aan projecten bij de teams Duurzame Bodem en Natuurlijk Kapitaal. Deze teams doen opdrachten vanuit de Rijksoverheid, provincies en gemeenten en de Europese Unie. Jij verzamelt en interpreteert onderzoeksgegevens, ontwikkelt modellen, maakt analyses en je legt dit alles vast in wetenschappelijke rapportages en adviezen.



Je dagelijks werk is afwisselend en zal in ieder geval bestaan uit:


* Het verzamelen en interpreteren van ecologische data en biodiversiteit-data. Deze data vertaal je om concrete handvatten te geven voor monitoring van bodemfuncties, vitale bodem, duurzamer land- en ecosysteemgebruik;
* Het vertalen van ecologische kennis naar de levering van ecosysteemdiensten en de waardering van ecosysteemdiensten. Hierbij worden tools ontwikkeld voor de uitvoeringspraktijk. Een belangrijk project voor de komende vier jaar is het RIVM project BIOTICHS. Hierin staat de levering en waardering van ecosysteemdiensten centraal. Hierbij is aandacht voor zowel kansen als beperkingen door drukfactoren zoals bodemverontreining, droogte etc.;
* Integreren en verder ontwikkelen van monitoring van bodem en ondergrond;
* Schrijven van rapportages om de boodschap helder en concreet bij de beleidsmakers over te laten komen en het adviseren van beleidsmakers op basis van uitkomsten van het onderzoek;
* Het presenteren en toelichten van de resultaten bij de opdrachtgevers en op congressen is ook onderdeel van je werk.

**Who we are:**  

The Rainforest Alliance is creating a more sustainable world by using social and market forces to protect nature and improve the lives of farmers and forest communities. To achieve our mission, we partner with diverse allies around the world to drive positive change across global supply chains and in many of our most critically important natural landscapes.  

  

Our alliance spans 70 countries and includes farmers and forest communities, companies, governments, civil society, and millions of individuals. Together we work to protect forests and biodiversity, take action on climate, and promote the rights and improve the livelihoods of rural people.  

  

As an international nonprofit organization with more than 30 years of experience in sustainability transformation, we understand that the social and economic well-being of rural communities is tightly connected to ecosystem health. This knowledge has shaped our rigorous programs to advance sustainable land-use and commodity production.  

  

At the Rainforest Alliance we combat climate change, protect forests and biodiversity, promote human rights, and improve livelihoods. The enormity of the social and environmental challenges we are facing requires working together in a broad alliance. This is why we bring farmers, forest communities, companies, and consumers together to change the way the world produces, sources, and consumes.  

  

**Why**  

To protect nature and improve lives it’s becoming increasingly urgent that we approach the way we use our land and produce food and other products in more sustainable ways. For this to succeed we need to fundamentally change the way that businesses operate and source, and the choices we all make as consumers.  

  

**How**  

Our growing global alliance aims to transform our relationship with our natural resources and each other, to create a better future for people and nature together.  

  

**The Rainforest Alliance encourages diversity and inclusion across the global organization. With this commitment to diversity, we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, color, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ages, disability and any other protected group.**",r,https://recruiting.ultipro.com/RAI1015FORES/JobBoard/7a1c3d86-f0fa-4e0e-a501-dcfedd4f7d8c/OpportunityDetail?opportunityId=30384731-3129-497a-a55d-9a5ddcea1ec2&postingId=a707b7b3-b2cf-483d-91b3-36b2e5bb84ef,,,,,,,,,,,ce9715e05eb6465f,,en

**De afdeling -** ***Directie Toeslagen***  

Data Analytics Toeslagen (DAT) bestaat uit verschillende zelforganiserende teams die in nauw verband samenwerken met onze opdrachtgevers van zowel binnen als buiten de Dienst Toeslagen. Ons productportfolio bestaat voornamelijk uit data-analyses en waardevolle analyticsproducten, zoals dashboards en signaalmodellen. We maken gebruik van ons eigen Datafundament, dat we zelf opbouwen en beheren. Met de inzet van data helpen we Dienst Toeslagen innoveren tot een efficiëntere uitvoering, een effectiever toezichtorgaan, een goede rechtsmatigheidshandhaving en een betere interactie met onze burgers.


Om onze opdrachtenstroom samen te brengen en te prioriteren samen met onze opdrachtgevers werken we met portfolio- en productmanagement. Samen met de ontwikkelteams en het Datafundamentteam plannen we opdrachten in kwartaal cycli en proberen we zo snel mogelijk waarde op te leveren richting onze klanten.

 **De organisatie**  

Toeslagen  

Dienst Toeslagen is een zelfstandige, publieke dienstverlener, onderdeel van het ministerie van Financiën. We maken vitale voorzieningen als de huur, de zorgverzekering en de zorg voor kinderen voor iedereen betaalbaar. Maar als je er goed over nadenkt, gaat ons werk over veel meer dan alleen het uitkeren van een maandelijks voorschot aan mensen die daar recht op hebben. Wij zorgen ervoor dat mensen mee kunnen doen in de maatschappij. Zonder dat ze zich zorgen hoeven te maken of ze deze maand de huur, de kinderopvang of de zorgverzekering of de zorg voor hun kinderen nog kunnen betalen. Mensen helpen die ons hard nodig hebben, dat is waar we het voor doen. Door onze kennis in te zetten en -vooral- ons te blijven verplaatsen in de mensen om wie het gaat. Door hun problemen, twijfels en uitdagingen zo goed mogelijk te doorgronden.


Binnen Dienst Toeslagen heeft de Uitvoeringsorganisatie Herstel Toeslagen een specifieke, tijdelijke opdracht: gedupeerde ouders erkenning bieden en ruimhartig herstellen voor het onrecht dat hen is aangedaan rondom kinderopvangtoeslag.


Met elkaar en met de buitenwereld bouwen we aan Dienst Toeslagen. De motivatie om te leren van gemaakte fouten is in de hele organisatie voelbaar. Iedere dag opnieuw proberen we Dienst Toeslagen nog beter te laten aansluiten bij wat de samenleving vraagt. Zodat iedereen in Nederland, wie je ook bent en wat je persoonlijke situatie ook is, kan meedoen.


Wij maken meedoen mogelijk. Kom jij ons daarbij helpen?

Ben jij een nieuwsgierige en ambitieuze student met een passie voor data science? Heb je altijd al willen werken met grote datasets en wil je een directe impact maken op bedrijfsprocessen? Dan is deze stage bij Achmea precies wat je zoekt!


Op onze afdeling IT Procesmanagement houden we ons bezig met het beschrijven en implementeren van basis ITIL-processen. Onze processen worden uitgevoerd in gespecialiseerde tools en we beschikken over een dashboard dat de prestaties van deze processen toont. Tot nu toe hebben we onze data voornamelijk gebruikt voor terugblik-analyses, maar we willen verder. We zoeken een stagiair die ons kan helpen om voorspellende informatie uit onze data te halen en daarmee onze dienstverlening verder te verbeteren.


Je krijgt te maken met data van het IT-kernbedrijf, met informatie over changes, incidenten, requests, problemen en kennisartikelen. De uitdaging is om te onderzoeken of er voorspellende modellen ontwikkeld kunnen worden om bijvoorbeeld incidenten te voorkomen, en om afhankelijkheden tussen processen te identificeren. Met jouw hulp willen we onze processen naar een hoger niveau tillen.


Ons team van procesmanagers staat klaar om je alles te vertellen over de processen en hun doelen. Daarnaast kun je rekenen op ondersteuning van de bedrijfsanalist, de architect van onze tooling en de ontwikkelaars van ons dashboard. Hoewel de diepgaande kennis over data science niet binnen ons team ligt, zorgen wij voor de juiste contacten en toegang tot onze dataspecialisten.


Bij Achmea werken we met Python en R, dus ervaring met deze tools is een grote pre.

**De afdeling**  

In de afdeling IT Procesmanagement zitten de procesmanagers voor de basis ITIL-processen. Wij beschrijven en implementeren deze processen. Er is tooling waarin deze processen worden uitgevoerd en waar de data in zit. Ook hebben we een dashboard over deze processen heen en de data hiervoor zit in een datalake.


Wij zijn een klein team (7 medewerkers) dat enthousiast werkt aan verbeteringen en vernieuwingen op het gebied van processen en processturing.


Wij proberen elk half jaar een stagiar te hebben die ons helpt op de gebieden waar wij zelf minder verstand van hebben. De afgelopen tijd waren dit studenten op het gebied van communicatie, nu willen we ons meer richten op de mogelijkheden die data en AI ons kunnen bieden.

**Jouw achtergrond**  

* Je hebt een achtergrond in data science, data engineering, AI of een vergelijkbare IT-studie.
* Je hebt ervaring met data-analyse en machine learning.
* Je kunt zelfstandig werken en weet hoe je inzichten uit data kunt halen en toepassen.
* Je hebt kennis van Python en R, en kunt hiermee complexe modellen bouwen.
* Je kunt goed communiceren en samenwerken met verschillende stakeholders.


Solliciteren?

* Je kunt direct solliciteren via de button;
* Je kunt solliciteren tot en met Vrijdag 26 Juli;
* De startdatum van deze stage is September 2024.

Current statistical methodology still reflects the use-context of its first development in the 1920s: methods assume that researchers make all important analysis choices before gathering the data. In modern data science age, however, data-driven paradigms have become dominant: many measurements are gathered simultaneously and it is often natural to pursue research questions that were not of obvious interest a priori. Looking at the data is scientifically sensible to do, but the problem is that current statistical methods cannot handle this behaviour well. What is needed for this, is the right mathematical framework, that gives the necessary error control guarantees without all the old restrictive assumptions. In this PhD project you will develop such mathematical foundations by bringing together exciting novel developments in mathematical statistics and machine learning theory, among which: closed testing, bandits, and the new theory of hypothesis testing with e-values, co-developed by your supervisor Dr. Rianne de Heide.



You will:


* Perform daily PhD-level research
* Publish results in journals and conference proceedings, and present these at (inter)national workshops and conferences.
* Contribute to teaching activities related to your work.
* Be a part of an excellent young research group, and benefit from frequent (virtual) interaction with other internationally renowned research groups working on e-values, such as at CWI (Amsterdam), LUMC (Leiden) and in the US.

We are an inclusive group and diversity is at the heart of our research principles. We care about a good working atmosphere and a good work-life balance. Applications from all groups currently under-represented in academic posts are especially encouraged. We particularly encourage women and people from minority groups to apply.


### **Your profile**

* You have, or will shortly acquire a master degree in (applied) mathematics or a related degree with a strong theoretical mathematical component. Enthusiasm for the topic of the project is more important than your choice of specialization in your master’s.
* You are proficient in English.
* Scientific programming skills are a plus, e.g. in R, Python, C++, Julia, etc.
### **Our offer**

* As a PhD candidate at UT, you will be appointed to a full-time position for four years, with a qualifier in the first year, within a very stimulating and exciting scientific environment;
* The University offers a dynamic ecosystem with enthusiastic colleagues;
* Your salary and associated conditions are in accordance with the collective labour agreement for Dutch universities (CAO-NU);
* You will receive a gross monthly salary ranging from € 2.770,- (first year) to € 3.539,- (fourth year);
* There are excellent benefits including a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%, and a solid pension scheme;
* The flexibility to work partially from home;
* A minimum of 232 leave hours in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A full-time employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.
* Free access to sports facilities on campus
* A family-friendly institution that offers parental leave (both paid and unpaid);
* You will have a training programme as part of the Twente Graduate School where you and your supervisors will determine a plan for a suitable education and supervision;
* We encourage a high degree of responsibility and independence, while collaborating with close colleagues, researchers and other staff.
### **Information and application**



Are you interested in this position? Please send your application via the '' button below **before August 1** and include:


* A cover letter (maximum 2 pages A4), emphasizing your specific interest, qualifications, motivations to apply for this position.
* A Curriculum Vitae, including a list of all courses attended and grades obtained, and, if applicable, a list of publications.
* Contact information of two references who we may contact.
* An IELTS-test, Internet TOEFL test (TOEFL-iBT), or a Cambridge CAE-C (CPE). Applicants with a non-Dutch qualification and who have not had secondary and tertiary education in English can only be admitted with an IELTS-test showing a total band score of at least 6.5, internet.

-------------------


  
Help met jouw onderzoek naar de kwaliteit van drinkwater om in Nederland nu en in de toekomst voldoende drinkwater van goede kwaliteit uit de kraan kunnen tappen. Met jouw adviezen heb je invloed op beleid en kun je verschil maken in de maatschappij. Je komt terecht in een team dat voor elkaar klaar staat en intrinsiek zeer gemotiveerd is.

Werken aan drinkwaterkwaliteit  

Bij het RIVM werken wij met een team van acht collega’s aan de bescherming van drinkwaterbronnen en de drinkwaterkwaliteit van bron tot en met kraan. Wij onderzoeken hoe klimaatthema’s als opwarming, verdroging of hoosbuien invloed hebben op de kwaliteit van drinkwater en de gezondheid van de mensen die het gebruiken. Ook onderzoeken we nieuwe en nog onbekende toxische stoffen in het milieu, zoals PFAS en microplastics, en hun effecten.



Jouw functie  

Jij ondersteunt het drinkwaterteam op het gebied van drinkwaterkwaliteit. Je schrijft mee aan rapporten waarin je onder andere aangeleverde data verwerkt en inzichtelijk maakt met grafische analyses. Deze rapporten dienen als onderbouwing van besluiten en voor landelijk en Europees beleid. Hierbij is rechtstreeks contact met opdrachtgevers en de watersector belangrijk. Je zult dus contact hebben met het ministerie van IenW, de Inspectie voor Leefomgeving en Transport en collega’s bij andere instituten of waterbedrijven.



Jij werkt aan het antwoord op vragen van IenW die gaan over de chemische kwaliteit van bronnen, drinkwater en drinkwatermaterialen. Om tot dergelijke antwoorden te komen:


* Verzamel en analyseer je data over deze thema's. Hierbij maak je onder andere gebruik van gegevens in projecten voor de Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport en IenW in verband met jaarlijkse rapportages over drinkwaterkwaliteit, zowel voor Nederland als de EU;
* Je kunt ook betrokken worden bij het toepassen en ontwikkelen van modellen zoals gedrag en transport van stoffen in water en bodem;
* Uiteraard betrek je relevante deskundigen bij het integreren van kennis. Je werkt vaak multidisciplinair samen met collega’s van andere afdelingen en RIVM-centra;
* Je schrijft adviezen en rapporten voor overheden en je publiceert je werk in vakbladen. Ook presenteer je je werk voor commissies en op congressen en symposia.


De komende jaren wordt de herziene EU-drinkwaterrichtlijn in Nederland uitgerold. Hierbij is er ook veel aandacht voor de veiligheid en kwaliteit van drinkwater. Data analyse wordt hierbij steeds belangrijker. Het bewerken en aanleveren van drinkwaterkwaliteitsgegevens aan de Inspectie Leefomgeving en Transport en de Europese Commissie is ook één van jouw toekomstige rollen.



Uniek aan deze baan  

De drinkwatergroep is de schakel tussen beleid, wetenschap en de Nederlandse drinkwatersector. In deze functie krijg je de kans om met jouw kennis en gedegen data-analyse kwaliteiten vragen uit de praktijk te beantwoorden. Met jouw antwoorden ondersteun en onderbouw je het beleid om de drinkwaterkwaliteit ook in de toekomst te kunnen waarborgen. Omdat er veel vragen zijn over de veiligheid van drinkwater en bescherming van drinkwaterbronnen, zoals recent over PFAS en waterschaarste, werk je in deze functie samen met deskundigen op allerlei vakgebieden. Dat verrijkt je vakkennis en je netwerk!



Ons team is een mix van minder en meer ervaren professionals, die open en toegankelijk contact met elkaar hebben. We zijn bevlogen en intrinsiek gemotiveerd om verschil te maken in Nederland. Bij ons is hybride werken ook het nieuwe normaal, waarbij we je de helft van de tijd graag op kantoor zien, voor de teambinding en een soepele samenwerking.

-------------------


  
Heb je interesse in de bestrijding van infectieziekten? Wil je bijdragen aan de surveillance van luchtweginfecties en de monitoring van de sterfte in Nederland? In deze rol krijg jij de kans om kennis en expertise te ontwikkelen op het gebied van infectieziektesurveillance en epidemiologie.



Wat ga je doen



Jij voert de surveillance uit van luchtweginfecties zoals griep, COVID-19 en respiratoir syncytieel virus (RSV). Het RIVM volgt de ontwikkeling en verspreiding van luchtweginfecties op de voet. Op verschillende manieren verzamelen, analyseren en interpreteren we gegevens over luchtweginfecties. Zo kunnen we inschatten hoeveel luchtweginfecties in Nederland voorkomen en wat de belangrijkste ziekteverwekkers zijn. Waar nodig wordt over mogelijke onderzoeksvragen ten behoeve van bestrijding afgestemd met verschillende (internationale) samenwerkingspartners. Daarnaast zul je een rol spelen in de monitoring van de landelijke (over)sterfte.



Je voert epidemiologische analyses uit en draagt bij aan de (online) rapportage en wetenschappelijke publicatie van data en resultaten. Daarnaast werk je mee aan de verbetering van de surveillance en het onderhouden en uitbouwen van diverse datapipelines in het statistische programma R.



Over de afdeling



Je komt te werken als junior epidemioloog bij de afdeling respiratoire infecties (RES). Binnen deze afdeling houden ongeveer twintig collega’s zich bezig met surveillance van en onderzoek naar luchtweginfecties. Denk aan COVID-19, influenza, tuberculose, legionella en luchtweginfecties veroorzaakt door nieuwe type virussen.



Binnen een team van circa vijf collega’s ga je werken aan de wekelijkse surveillance van acute luchtweginfecties. Het team zorgt onder andere voor de wekelijkse update op woensdag van de webpagina https://www.rivm.nl/luchtweginfecties/actuele-cijfers. Er wordt veel samengewerkt, maar iedereen heeft ook zijn eigen expertise. Op maandag en donderdag werkt het team op kantoor en de overige dagen is het mogelijk om thuis te werken. Binnen ons team weten we elkaar laagdrempelig te vinden en is een prettige informele sfeer. Zo zoeken wij elkaar regelmatig op voor een gezellige lunch(wandeling).



Meer over het Centrum Epidemiologie & Surveillance van Infectieziekten (EPI)



Bij het RIVM werken ruim 2500 collega’s elke dag samen aan de zorg voor morgen. Het centrum Epidemiologie en Surveillance van Infectieziekten (EPI), dat valt binnen het Centrum voor Infectieziektebestrijding, verzamelt gegevens om de stand van infectieziekten in de Nederlandse bevolking te volgen. EPI gebruikt hiervoor data uit surveillance om zo tijdig inzicht in trends en risico’s van infectieziekten te krijgen. EPI voert epidemiologisch onderzoek uit, onder andere rondom uitbraken van infectieziekten. Ook onderzoeken wij de (kosten)effectiviteit van maatregelen voor de bestrijding van infectieziekten. EPI richt zich hierbij op de effectiviteit van het Rijksvaccinatieprogramma, de bestrijding van seksueel overdraagbare aandoeningen, zorggerelateerde infecties, antimicrobiële resistentie, respiratoire ginfecties, enterale en vector-overdraagbare infecties en zoönosen. Dit alles wordt ondersteund door sterke methodologische expertise op het gebied van surveillance, biostatistiek en mathematische modellering.



De uitkomsten van ons werk worden onder andere door het ministerie van VWS, de Gezondheidsraad en GGD-en gebruikt voor beleid en adviezen; ook geven we als RIVM zelf aanbevelingen voor mogelijke interventies.



EPI bestaat uit verschillende professionele teams en typeert zich door vakinhoudelijke expertise en respect voor ieders inbreng.

LCI-collega Marion over haar baan



“Bij het RIVM en bij onze afdeling infectieziektebestrijding kun jij bijdragen aan grote maatschappelijke opgaven. Ons werk doet er echt toe. Hou je van het doen van wetenschappelijk onderzoek, maar wil je ook je onderzoeksresultaten vertaald zien in de praktijk, dan is het RIVM echt een plek voor jou. In mijn team kijken we steeds hoe ons onderzoek kan bijdragen aan een betere infectieziektebestrijding in zowel de nabije als de verre toekomst.”



Wat ga je doen



Je werkt voor het centrum Landelijke Coördinatie Infectieziektebestrijding (LCI) als sociaalwetenschappelijk onderzoeker, waar je bijdraagt aan en adviseert over verschillende kwalitatieve en kwantitatieve onderzoeksactiviteiten in nationale en internationale projecten. Zo voert de LCI in het nieuwe Europese project RAPIDE stakeholderanalyses uit onder gezondheidsprofessionals in vier verschillende landen (Slovenië, Malta, Italië en Nederland).



Het RAPIDE-project richt zich op het behoud van toegang tot reguliere gezondheids-en zorgdiensten tijdens noodsituaties zoals een pandemie. Met een stakeholder analyse (middels interviews, vragenlijsten en workshops) identificeren we in ieder land de belangrijkste actoren uit de gehele zorgketen. Hiervoor wordt er nauw samengewerkt met de andere projectpartners om ervoor te zorgen dat andere werkpakketten met de juiste actoren aan de slag gaan. Daarnaast zal de LCI binnen het thema Pandemische Paraatheid samen met interne en externe partijen de komende jaren werken aan een ‘social listening’ infrastructuur waarmee via verschillende kanalen (sociale media, vragenlijsten, in gesprek gaan met, etc.) en op een effectieve manier inzichten worden verkregen uit de maatschappij en vertaald worden in (risico-)communicatie en advies voor beleid en praktijk dat aansluit op de behoefte in de maatschappij. Als eerste stap zullen hiervoor gesprekken gevoerd worden met onder andere collega’s uit de infectieziektebestrijding (RIVM en GGD), communicatiemedewerkers en onderzoekers.



De LCI is op zoek naar een sociaalwetenschappelijk onderzoeker die ruime ervaring heeft met kwalitatief en kwantitatief onderzoek. We zoeken een onderzoeker die zowel inhoudelijk en zelfstandig onderzoek kan initiëren, uitvoeren en/of hieraan kan bijdragen, als coördinerend kan optreden en de centrale verbinder kan zijn tussen verschillende onderzoeksactiviteiten. Je hebt daarnaast een proactieve rol bij het identificeren, opstellen en indienen van nieuwe subsidieaanvragen. Je draagt bij aan rapporten en wetenschappelijke publicaties en je bent verantwoordelijk voor de beantwoording van vragen en voorbereiding van beleidsadvisering voor minimaal één onderwerp/project. Samen met de verschillende projectteams wordt jouw exacte portefeuille vormgegeven.



Je wordt onderdeel van een team van sociaalwetenschappelijke onderzoekers, gezondheidswetenschappers en epidemiologen (van binnen en buiten de LCI), die werken op het grensvlak van onderzoek en beleid. Door deze combinatie van hoog over tot en met concrete praktische toepassingen op de werkvloer leer je beide werkwerelden goed kennen. Je bouwt bovendien een sterk netwerk op, nationaal en internationaal, voor je verdere carrière. In afstemming met je afdelingshoofd werk je ook aan de verdere ontwikkeling van jouw eigen expertise(s).



De werksfeer is open en positief en er is ruimte om te werken in de vorm die jij wil, we werken namelijk hybride. Als je met iemand van het RIVm spreekt zal deze zeggen da er echt een bijzondere sfeer is waar we samen werken aan het het zelfde doel;de functie kan ook worden gevuld voor 32 uur, mocht dat beter bij jou passen.



Wie ben jij



Je bent open, onderzoekend, positief en maakt makkelijk contact met anderen. Hierbij snap je ook welke communicatiestijl bij wie effectief is. Met enthousiasme en de nodige doortastendheid doe jij je werk. Je houdt je ‘oog op de bal’ en bent resultaatgericht zonder de verbinding met anderen kwijt te raken. Jij luistert met oprechte aandacht, bent empathisch en weet junior onderzoekers en promovendi goed te coachen in hun onderzoeksactiviteiten. Analytisch en conceptueel kunnen denken zijn echt jouw talenten. Je schakelt snel en bewaart overzicht in nationale en internationale contexten en bijbehorende communicatie. Je werkt graag in een multidisciplinair team en bent een collegiale samenwerkingspartner vol energie. Je werkt nauwkeurig en efficiënt. Je kunt goed netwerken en hebt overtuigingskracht. Je bent gedreven om de publieke volksgezondheid te verbeteren.

Ons doel: een gezonde bevolking en een duurzame, veilige en gezonde leefomgeving. We bewaken gezondheid, ziekten, de kwaliteit van de leefomgeving én het milieu. Daarvoor doen we onderzoek en we verzamelen kennis voor toegankelijke informatie en toepasbare adviezen. Het RIVM zorgt voor een goede geboortescreening, het bestrijden van infectieziekten en heeft een centrale rol bij het Rijksvaccinatieprogramma en de bevolkingsonderzoeken. We onderzoeken wat er nodig is voor goede zorg, een gezonde leefstijl, veilige producten en een veilige en gezonde leefomgeving. Ook dragen we bij aan het voorkomen, bestrijden en beheersen van incidenten en crises.



Vanuit ons hoofdkantoor in Bilthoven en vanaf 2025 vanuit een prachtig nieuw gebouw op het Utrecht Science Park, werken we met ongeveer 2300 collega’s aan al onze adviezen, rapporten, factsheets en publicaties. Daarbij laten we ons leiden door de vragen van vandaag én morgen. We doen ons werk midden in de maatschappij. Trots zijn we op onze organisatie waar iedereen welkom is. Als kennisinstituut van de overheid willen we een afspiegeling van de samenleving zijn. Naast talent, ervaring en motivatie maken ook aspecten van identiteit zoals leeftijd, geaardheid, culturele achtergrond of arbeidsbeperking, onze organisatie rijker, innovatiever én leuker. Met deze verschillende achtergronden, perspectieven en inzichten werken wij samen aan een nog beter resultaat!

-------------------


  
Hoe verloopt de overgang van de Nederlandse vrouw? Wat voor invloed heeft de overgang op slaap en (mentale) gezondheid en vice versa? Ben jij geïnteresseerd in onderzoek hiernaar op basis van bestaande data van Nederlandse cohorten, dan is deze vacature interessant voor jou.



Wat ga je doen  

Je gaat meewerken aan het analyseren van de Doetinchem Cohort Studie (DCS). Deze studie volgt al meer dan 30 jaar een grote groep inwoners van Doetinchem en er is inmiddels een schat aan gegevens over risicofactoren en gezondheid van deze deelnemers. Je beschrijft de heterogeniteit in het beloop van de overgang bij vrouwen. Je onderzoekt hoe leefgewoonten (m.n. slaap) en gezondheid het beloop van de overgang beïnvloeden en hoe de overgang van invloed is op deze leefgewoonten en (mentale) gezondheid. Naast DCS zal ook gebruikt worden gemaakt van diverse andere cohort studies in Nederland.



Het project maakt onderdeel uit van het MenoPause Consortium gefinancierd door de Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek met als missie: een betere menopauze voor alle vrouwen. De onderzoeksresultaten worden gepubliceerd in internationale peer-reviewed artikelen en gebundeld in een proefschrift.



Een greep uit jouw takenpakket:


* Het controleren en analyseren van gegevens van de Doetinchem Cohort Studie en andere cohort data in NL.
* Literatuuronderzoek doen.
* Presenteren van je resultaten op (inter)nationale congressen.
* Schrijven van Engelstalige artikelen leidend tot een proefschrift.
* Incidenteel bijdragen aan de dataverzameling van de Doetinchem Cohort Studie.


Uniek aan deze baan


* Je werkt met unieke data, die verzameld zijn in de afgelopen decennia.
* Je werkt in een interessante onderzoekomgeving met talloze relevante onderzoeken en collega’s. Het geeft veel voldoening om samen met een team bij te dragen aan maatschappelijke vraagstukken.
* Samenwerking binnen een groot consortium en specifiek met UMCU (1e promotor prof. dr. ir. Monique Verschuren) en Amsterdam UMC (2e promotor mw. Prof dr. Birit Broekman).
* Woon je niet in de regio Utrecht? Dan heb je dat gemeen met een groot aantal van je collega’s. Een goede werk-privé balans staat bij ons centraal. Door plaats- en tijdonafhankelijk werken in te voeren zijn we, al voor de pandemie, gericht op het hybride werken.


Over de afdeling  

Bij het RIVM werken ruim 2500 collega’s elke dag samen aan de zorg van morgen. Binnen het centrum Voeding, Preventie en Zorg werkt de afdeling Levensloop, Leefstijl en Gezondheid aan kennis over gezondheid over de gehele levensloop en levert zo een bijdrage aan het volksgezondheidsbeleid in Nederland. Jij gaat deel uitmaken van deze afdeling, waarin met een enthousiaste groep collega’s gewerkt wordt aan veel verschillende onderwerpen.


  
Functie-eisen
-------------


  
Wie ben jij


* Je hebt een relevante universitaire opleiding, waarin je kennis hebt opgedaan over epidemiologie, statistische analyses, verouderingsvraagstukken, leefstijl en gezondheid.
* Je hebt affiniteit met de gezondheid van vrouwen en het onderwerp menopauze.
* Methodologische en statistische kennis en ervaring met het analyseren van complexe longitudinale datasets (SPSS, SAS, en/of R) is een pre.

Met een breed en commercieel productportfolio, waarvan een deel in eigen beheer wordt geproduceerd en aangevuld wordt met producten van gerenommeerde merken, streven we ernaar om onze klanten een optimale productmix te bieden.

Onze efficiënte organisatiestructuur komt voort uit een strikte scheiding van functionaliteit tussen het hoofdkantoor en de winkels. Het hoofdkantoor richt zich met een hoog niveau van automatisering op alle backofficeprocessen, terwijl de winkels zich volledig bezighouden met commerciële activiteiten, ondersteund door een sterke centrale marketingafdeling. Onze verkopers zijn daardoor volledig gericht op de klant en worden volledig ontlast van logistiek, aftersales, service en coördinerende taken. Deze lean en mean aanpak maakt onze organisatie zeer schaalbaar en resulteert in lage overheadkosten, wat onze klanten in staat stelt om te profiteren van zeer scherpe prijzen en tarieven.

Lab21 maakt altijd gebruik van directe grootschalige inkoop bij de bron. Hierdoor verkorten we de waardeketen en vereenvoudigen we het proces, wat resulteert in interessantere prijzen voor onze klanten. In tegenstelling tot bouwmarkten zijn wij gespecialiseerd in de productgroepen die wij verhandelen. Onze inkoper, tevens directeur, beschikt over een hoog niveau van expertise op het gebied van supply chain, wat verder reikt dan dat van een jonge inkoper bij een internationale bouwmarktketen. Deze toewijding en kennis stellen ons in staat om de beste producten te selecteren en aan te bieden aan onze klanten.

Met bewuste keuzes voor B- of C-locaties houden we onze huurkosten laag, zodat onze klanten niet betalen voor onnodig hoge kosten. Bij Lab21 zeggen we: ""De klant is geen koning, de klant is onze familie."" We streven er altijd naar om de meest geschikte vloer te kiezen voor de klant, in plaats van simpelweg de duurste optie te verkopen.

Als innovatief bedrijf omarmt Lab21 de kracht van generative AI en data science om onze bedrijfsprocessen te optimaliseren en onze klanten een nog betere ervaring te bieden.

Wij geloven sterk dat goede dienstverlening gebaseerd is op betrouwbare informatie. Daarom investeren we aanzienlijk in ICT-systemen om onze service en communicatie met klanten te optimaliseren. Elke order wordt behandeld als een individueel project, met als doel de klant volledig te ontzorgen. Bij een verbouwing en/of verhuizing ervaart de klant al genoeg stress. Daarom zorgen wij ervoor dat de vloer en alle voorbereidende werkzaamheden goed worden gepland en ""just-in-time"" uitgevoerd. Dit vereist uitstekend projectmanagement en coördinatie, vooral omdat er vaak externe partijen zoals leveranciers en transporteurs bij betrokken zijn. Daarom blijven we investeren in continue procesoptimalisatie.

Bij Lab21 is een tevreden klant onze grootste voldoening, elke dag opnieuw.

**Onze ambitie**

Lab21 is ambitieus. We zien dat onze formule succesvol is en het aantal klanten jaar na jaar sterk groeit. We streven ernaar om de beste te zijn en te blijven in onze markt.

We geloven sterk in de schaalbaarheid en globaliteit van onze formule. Daarom willen we onze activiteiten uitbreiden buiten Nederlandse grenzen. We zijn vastbesloten om onze positie te versterken en te groeien. We zijn ervan overtuigd dat onze aanpak en productaanbod aantrekkelijk zijn voor klanten in diverse Europese markten en andere continenten.

***Ben jij de topper in agile test engineering die de puntjes op de i zet bij de doorontwikkeling van het grootste e-commerce platform voor food professionals?***  


Bij Sligro Food Group is Digital een zeer belangrijk onderdeel van de strategie. De food service markt zit namelijk in een digitale transformatie. Die transformatie brengt veranderingen met zich mee die ook bij Sligro in veel disciplines moeten worden doorleeft. De food business was en is sterk smaak gedreven en wordt mondjesmaat ook data gedreven. De nog traditionele organisatie moet dus worden meegenomen in het omgaan met, en de aanpak van digitale uitdagingen, in alle capabilities. IT Online loopt voorop in die verandering. Hoog op de agenda staat een transitie naar een agile en DevOps manier van werken. Daarmee heeft Online een belangrijke rol als voorbeeld, verkenner, aanjager en supporter van deze change. De eerste stappen zijn gezet. We willen nu gaan doorpakken.  


**Wat is de uitdaging?**
Sligro is marktleider in foodservices in Nederland en wil dit ook online zijn en blijven. Van de totale omzet loopt ruim 70% reeds via het Online platform, waarmee we één van de grootste e-commerce platformen van Nederland hebben. Vanzelfsprekend maken we ook de hele logistieke keten en klantervaring steeds meer digitaal toegankelijk, klantgericht en betrouwbaar. Dat dit business kritisch is, zal je duidelijk zijn. In deze rol ga je IT Online helpen met verdere verfijning van de klantreis, uitbreiding van functionaliteit en versnelling van de ontwikkelstraat, met behoud van 24/7 beschikbaarheid van het Online platform. We willen food professionals in Nederland en België ook Online écht verder brengen.  


**Naar wie zijn we op zoek?**
Als **Agile Test Engineer** ga je ons helpen met het ontwikkelen en leveren van robuuste IT-oplossingen. Kwaliteit en agility zitten in je DNA en dat draag je ook uit. In deze rol ben je namelijk mede-verantwoordelijk voor de levering en verbetering van de Online kanalen, en daarmee ook direct voor de omzet, winst en groei van Sligro Food Group. Als Agile Test Engineer weet je hoe je de bestaande visie en test strategie moet vertalen naar concrete testgevallen. Het automatiseren van testen alsmede Test Data Management en CI/CD hebben geen geheimen voor je. Als lid van een agile delivery team zorg je voor scherpe acceptatie criteria die iedere sprint worden afgetikt en vraag je ook continu aandacht voor kwaliteit van requirements en designs. Ook neem je je verantwoordelijkheid om software developers uit te dagen om code van hoge kwaliteit op te leveren, want je weet als geen ander dat kwaliteit een gezamenlijke inspanning en verantwoordelijkheid vereist. Als Agile Test Engineer maak je deel uit van het Test Chapter en werk je nauw samen met de Quality Lead om constant te verbeteren. Een shift-left in de ontwikkelstraat is een belangrijke verbetering. De rol is hybride (60/40) voor 32 tot 40 uren in Veghel. Je rapporteert aan de DevOps Lead Online.  


Denk bij concrete taken bijvoorbeeld aan:
* In een vroeg stadium beoordeel je requirements en designs om te waarborgen dat de uitgangsdocumentatie voor zowel softwareontwikkeling als QA altijd op orde is, functioneel en technisch.
* Je neemt de verantwoordelijkheid voor het opstellen, uitvoeren en onderhouden van testgevallen voor zowel progressie als regressie testen met en door het team. Je identificeert en analyseert gevonden bugs en defects en coördineert een passende oplossing. Je rapporteert en adviseert de PO over de status, uitkomsten en risico’s van de bevindingen.
* Samen met de QA Lead werk je samen met belanghebbenden om richtlijnen en testconventies op te stellen voor niet-functionele aspecten, zoals code kwaliteit, security, wet- en regelgeving, performance en beschikbaarheid. Je borgt deze in geautomatiseerde tests die stelselmatig worden uitgevoerd.
* Je bent in staat om zowel functionele als niet-functionele regressietesten te automatiseren met tooling zoals Robot Framework, Playwright en Gatling.
* Samen met je team benoem je in iedere sprint en voor alle stories zowel functionele als niet-functionele risico's en neem je de juiste maatregelen om deze met je team te mitigeren.
* Binnen je team zorg je voor een optimale data set aan herbruikbare testgevallen en geautomatiseerde en handmatige test scripts.
* Samen met de QA Lead documenteer, deel en integreer je nieuwe inzichten en ervaringen ten behoeve van continue verbeteringen van de testaanpak. De test strategie volgt meer en meer het shift-left principe, waarvoor je binnen je team de regie neemt om dit principe samen met je product owner en ontwikkelteam planmatig vorm te geven.

  


**Wat breng je mee?**
* Je hebt aantoonbaar zeer ruime ervaring met CI/CD processen en tools, zoals SonarQube, Selenium, X-Ray, Playwright, Robot Framework, Gatling, Jenkins en Nexus, alsmede Jira en Confluence.
* Je hebt kennis en ervaring van een of meerdere script dan wel programmeertalen zoals Python, Java of JavaScript en bij voorkeur ook van SAP Hybris en Adobe AEM.
* Je bent Certified ISTQB Advanced Test Analyst en/of ISTQB Advanced Technical Test Analyst of CAT certified.
* Je weet wat het betekent om te werken aan een business kritisch 24/7 front-end applicatie platform in een microservices eco-systeem, waarin continu nieuwe versies worden uitgerold.
* Je hebt hands-on ervaring met exploratory testing en test automatisering als lid van een DevOps team en je weet daar correct, snel en doortastend op te acteren en rapporteren.
* Je weet verbinding te leggen met alle belanghebbenden binnen en buiten je team om zodoende een gezamenlijke “Quality Awareness” te bewerkstelligen.
* Je weet hoe je met het hele team, inclusief product owner, testbare requirements scherp kunt krijgen in user stories, bijvoorbeeld via SMART en INVEST. Je bewaakt de DoR en de DoD met professionele passie.
* Je communiceert makkelijk en goed, zowel in het Nederlands als Engels, mondeling en schriftelijk.
* Je bent accuraat, doortastend, omgevingsbewust, inventief, stressbestendig en uitgesproken.

Hou je graag veel ballen in de lucht en weet je met mandaat om te gaan? Dan zoeken we jou!


**Jouw impact als Business Analist Finance**
--------------------------------------------


Je analyseert de impact van wijzigingen in processen, systemen en het product. Jij bent de schakel tussen de business, productontwikkeling en IT. Én (dit is natuurlijk nog het allerbelangrijkste) je bent in staat om constant door de bril van de klant te kijken. Dit zijn de deelnemers en werkgevers met een pensioenregeling bij BeFrank. Wat de rol van Business Analist Finance bij BeFrank anders maakt? Als Business Analist Finance bij BeFrank moet je er van houden om met (veel) verschillende dingen tegelijk bezig te zijn. We werken in onze eigen(wijze) vorm van Agile/Scrum. Je bent dus steeds met verschillende features bezig. De strategische doelen van het bedrijf vertaal je naar de realiteit. En omdat we een kleine wendbare organisatie zijn, zie je direct wat je hebt bedacht in de praktijk terug! Je krijgt veel verantwoordelijkheid en inspraak maar dit kan ook een valkuil zijn. Jouw doel is om het helder, eenvoudig en online voor iedereen te maken. Als iedereen het snapt, ben jij tevreden.


**Met wie je werkt**
--------------------


Bij BeFrank werken zo’n 110 mensen, waarvan ongeveer 55 in het IT team. We werken in vier DevOps teams bestaande uit developers, een Product Owner, Business Analist en een Functioneel Beheerder. Eén van deze DevOps teams is het Finance IT team, hier zul jij als Business Analist in terecht komen. Daarnaast vorm je samen met de andere Business analisten, de UX-designer en de Data Scientist een hecht team. Je werkt nauw samen met je collega’s in je DevOps team. Al heb je in jouw rol eigenlijk contact met alle teams binnen BeFrank!

* Het opstellen van requirements en deze uitwerken in user stories, waarbij je ook oog hebt voor de datakwaliteit;
* Deze analyses verder verfijnen met de development teams (zij de techniek, jij houdt het einddoel scherp);
* Mee testen waar nodig of in het testproces de rol van Business Analist borgen (o.a door mede opstellen en reviewen van testplannen);
* Een vraagbaak zijn voor de business, meedenken met de verschillende stakeholders en in alle meningen de juiste weg naar voren kiezen.

**Wat je meebrengt**
--------------------


Je hebt een afgeronde HBO- of WO-opleiding en minimaal 5 jaar werkervaring als Business Analist binnen de financiële dienstverlening. De Nederlandse taal beheers je vloeiend, en werken in een Agile omgeving is voor jou een tweede natuur. Ook heb je aantoonbare kennis van procesontwerpen. Je overziet de keten en kunt vanuit de keten denken. De taal van de developers begrijp je (maar het ontwikkelen zelf laat je natuurlijk aan hen over). Je bent een kei in samenwerken en verbindt collega’s met als doel samen tot een oplossing te komen. Jij wil het complete plaatje begrijpen en deinst er niet voor terug om net zo lang door te gaan tot je de benodigde informatie hebt. En heb jij al kennis van pensioen? Of ben je bekend met Exact, Salesforce, SQL, data analyse technieken en/of het werken in DevOps teams? Dan is dat een grote pre!

--------------------------


### **Locatie(s):**


Driebergen
### **Organisatieonderdeel:**


Politiedienstencentrum
### **Vakgebied(en):**


ICT
### **Niveau:**


HBO BACHELOR
**Wat ga je doen?**
-------------------


Wij zijn op zoek naar een ervaren Linux NIDS expert met een brede interesse in dit onderwerp. Je werkzaamheden bestaan onder andere uit het optimaliseren van onze netwerksensoren die gebaseerd zijn op de open-source applicaties *Suricata* en *Zeek*. Deze optimalisaties variëren van de hardware-laag tot aan de applicaties zelf. Je zult met behulp van Network Packet Brokers slimme filtering en efficiënte verwerkingspaden maken. Ook werk je aan uitbreiding van onze monitoring platformen met nieuwe tools en functionaliteiten.


Onze platformen verwerken zeer grote hoeveelheden data, waardoor de kleinste optimalisaties al grote effecten kunnen bewerkstelligen. Met jouw visie gaan we verder in het automatiseren van deze platformen, denk hierbij aan tooling als Ansible, Gitlab CI/CD en Python. Idealiter ben je bekend met termen als NUMA, IRQ balancing en RSS. Maar ook BPF, regex en rulemanagement zijn zaken die je interessant vindt. Je deinst er in ieder geval niet voor terug om online te zoeken naar best-practices om daarna de discussie met je collega's aan te gaan over de beste oplossing voor een probleem.


Verder voer je als cybersecurity analist binnen het SOC diepgaand onderzoek uit naar (mogelijke) security incidenten. Dit is niet enkel een technisch proces maar ook een creatief proces. Daarnaast heb je zitting in politie brede expertgroepen en neemt deel aan het CSIRT (Crisisorganisatie ten tijde van cyberaanvallen met een grote impact). Met andere woorden: ook in tijden van crisis sta jij je mannetje (m/v). Dat betekent ook dat er een consignatieregeling van kracht is.


Daarnaast vind je het leuk om te coachen en ben je in staat om de inhoud van het werk over te brengen op minder ervaren collega’s en werk je mee aan het verder ontwikkelen van het SOC


**Waar ga je werken?**
----------------------


Als cybersecurity ergens topprioriteit heeft, dan is het wel bij de politie. Je komt te werken bij het SOC binnen de Sector Informatiebeveiliging in Driebergen. Binnen de Sector vind je naast het SOC ook Threat Intelligence, Offensive Operations, Risicomanagement, Insider Threat, Beleid & Regie, Bewustwording, het Accountteam en Cryptobeheer. De Sector valt onder het Politie Diensten Centrum en houdt zich bezig met de informatiebeveiliging van alle politieonderdelen. Het SOC heeft tot taak het bewaken van de netwerken en de systemen van de politie om cyberaanvallen tijdig te detecteren en de verdediging steeds beter te maken en te actualiseren, zodat de ‘kroonjuwelen’ van de politie veilig zijn


**Wie ben jij?**
----------------


Security is mensenwerk; je hebt daarom ervaring met het stimuleren en motiveren van collega’s. Je coacht graag de minder ervaren collega’s op inhoud en houding. En wij verwachten dat je dè go-to expert bent op een of meer expertisegebieden bieden het SOC. Met andere woorden: van bepaalde onderwerpen weet je (bijna) alles en van de overige onderwerpen een beetje minder maar nog steeds genoeg om te weten wat je zelf kunt en wanneer je een collega moet inschakelen.


Bij grote cyberincidenten ben je bereid om ook buiten kantoortijden te werken. Hiertoe draai je mee in het consignatierooster.


Verder heb je:


* WO (master) werk- en denkniveau\*;
* minimaal drie jaar gefunctioneerd in een senior rol en aantoonbare ervaring met Linux, Suricata en/of Zeeken en het Ansible configuratiemanagement-platform;
* kennis van NUMA, IRQ balancing, RSS, Network Packet Brokers en bijbehorende technologie en functionaliteiten. Daarbij heb je ook kennis van netwerkprotocollen op alle lagen van het OSI-model;
* ervaring met het benchmarken van hardware onderdelen en applicaties op een Linux server en bent bekend met de voordelen en werking van SmartNICs of bent bereid je daarin te verdiepen;
* meerdere afgeronde SANS opleidingen (of soortgelijke) en bent bereid deze te behalen dan wel uit te breiden.


**Wat wij bieden**
------------------


De standplaats is Driebergen-Rijsenburg. Er is ruimte voor 1 fte. Het betreft een functie voor 36 uur per week. Omdat goede mensen belangrijk zijn binnen de politie investeren we in jouw toekomst. We bieden uitgebreide ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden en een aanstelling in tijdelijke dienst voor een proeftijd van een jaar. Bij voldoende functioneren wordt de aanstelling na een jaar omgezet in een vaste aanstelling.


Verder kun je het volgende van ons verwachten:


* een bruto maandsalaris van minimaal € 5.350,- en maximaal € 7.456,- (schaal 13 Bbp) op basis van een 36-urige werkweek;

**Vergroot het inzicht in de economische relaties van Nederland met het buitenland als analist betalingsbalans statistieken bij DNB.**
Jij hebt impact


Bij DNB draag je bij aan financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. In deze functie werk je mee aan het opstellen van de Nederlandse betalingsbalans en analyseer je relevante trends en actuele ontwikkelingen in de economische relaties van Nederland met het buitenland. Je vertegenwoordigt DNB in nationaal en internationaal overleg met partijen zoals de Europese Centrale Bank (ECB) en het Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS). En je draagt er aan bij dat beschikbare data en informatie beter en efficiënter in de betalingsbalans kunnen worden opgenomen. Zo draag je bij aan DNB als hét expertisecentrum op het gebied van data over het Nederlandse financiële stelsel.


#### **Zo doe je dat als financieel-economisch analist betalingsbalans bij DNB**


De Nederlandse financiële sector en economie is sterk verweven met het buitenland; zo is Nederland bijvoorbeeld een van de landen met de grootste directe investeringsposities ter wereld. De betalingsbalans brengt de internationale economische relaties van Nederland in kaart, is voor beleidsmakers en onderzoekers een belangrijke basis voor analyses en het maken van geïnformeerde beleidskeuzes, en wordt regelmatig gebruikt in publicaties.  

  

Als betalingsbalans-analist ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor het opstellen van de Nederlandse betalingsbalans en gerelateerde statistieken, waarbij je jezelf ontwikkelt als expert op het gebied van buitenlandse directe investeringen. Je bent goed in het vinden en beoordelen van relevante ontwikkelingen en bent nieuwsgierig naar het verhaal achter de cijfers. Daarnaast kan je hierover in begrijpelijke taal communiceren aan interne en externe collega-statistici en gebruikers. Bijvoorbeeld in de vorm van publicaties, rapporten en presentaties. Dat vraagt om een scherp analytisch vermogen, goede oordeelsvorming, en affiniteit met data-analyse en ICT.


Wat ga je verder nog doen?


* Je ontwikkelt en onderhoudt programmatuur voor de bewerking en beoordeling van data – bijvoorbeeld in Python of PowerBI – om de statistieken verder mee te verbeteren.
* Je draagt bij aan een continue verbetering van de werkprocessen in het team.
* Je speelt een actieve rol in de SCRUM/Agile werkwijze van het team door samen met je teamgenoten te bepalen hoe de teamdoelen het beste bereikt kunnen worden, en naar je collega’s helder te maken wat dat betekent voor je eigen planning.
Hier doe je dat


De afdeling Betalingsbalans, Bancaire statistieken en Publicaties (BBBP) van de divisie Statistiek bestaat uit ongeveer 25 medewerkers, verdeeld over drie teams. De sfeer is collegiaal met veel ruimte voor eigen initiatief en persoonlijke ontwikkeling. We werken met complexe databronnen en –processen, die via steeds innovatievere methoden worden geanalyseerd. De afdeling werkt nauw samen met collega’s binnen DNB, het CBS en met internationale instellingen zoals de ECB en het IMF.


Bij DNB werken we hybride. Uitgangspunt is dat je ten minste de helft van je wekelijkse werktijd op kantoor. Er is voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Bij DNB werk je met inhoudelijke professionals. Je collega’s leggen de lat hoog en verwachten hetzelfde van jou. Daarom vinden we het belangrijk dat jij beschikt over een ijzersterk analytisch vermogen, een flinke dosis nieuwsgierigheid en doorzettingsvermogen. Je werkt graag met data, bent in staat deze op robuuste en efficiënte wijze te bewerken en weet relevante trends en ontwikkelingen in de data te signaleren. Je kunt complexe vraagstukken helder ordenen en vertalen naar oplossingen, bijvoorbeeld voor een dataproces of analyseraamwerk. Ook heb je een goed gevoel voor automatisering en dataverwerking.


Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?


* Je hebt een master-opleiding, het liefst in een financieel-economische of andere kwantitatieve richting.
* Je bent een starter of je hebt een paar jaar werkervaring in een financiële of data-intensieve omgeving.
* Affiniteit met data-analyse en programmeren is een must, ervaring een pre.
* Je kunt uitstekend communiceren, in het Nederlands en in het Engels, en bent ambitieus, leergierig en daadkrachtig.
Dit bieden we je

Defensie zet zich in voor de belangen, welvaart en vrijheid van Nederland. We zijn dagelijks actief in binnen- en buitenland. Onze wereldwijde inzet versterkt de internationale samenwerking en zorgt ervoor dat mensen zich in vrijheid kunnen ontplooien. Nu en in de toekomst.



Bij het ministerie van Defensie werken ongeveer 62.000 mensen direct en indirect aan vrede en veiligheid. Het ministerie bestaat uit de Bestuursstaf (het departement), de Koninklijke Marine, de Koninklijke Landmacht, de Koninklijke Luchtmacht, de Koninklijke Marechaussee, het Defensie Ondersteuningscommando (DOSCO) en de Defensie Materieel Organisatie (DMO).  

Defensie is een van de grootste werkgevers van Nederland en vertoont overeenkomsten met een groot bedrijf. De operationele commando's (zee-, land- en luchtstrijdkrachten), de Marechaussee, het DOSCO en de DMO lijken op werkmaatschappijen.



Commando Zeestrijdkrachten  

Het Commando Zeestrijdkrachten (CZSK) richt zich op het leveren van veiligheid op en vanuit zee. Het CZSK is, als het uitvoerende deel van de Koninklijke Marine en het maritieme deel van de Nederlandse krijgsmacht, verantwoordelijk voor de inzetbaarheid en integratie van de operationele vloot- en marinierseenheden en voor de inbedding van de eenheden in ‘joint’ en ‘combined’ verband.

De afdeling P&O Koninklijke Marine is de deskundige partner van het CZSK op het gebied van hr. Wij dragen bij aan het realiseren van de ambities van het CZSK op het gebied van de personele gereedstelling en goed werkgeverschap.  

Dit doen we door het personeel de mogelijkheid te bieden zich te ontwikkelen en te ontplooien. Zo leveren we als doorstroomorganisatie een relevante bijdrage aan Defensie en de arbeidsmarkt. Door de medewerkers te binden en boeien bieden we de mogelijkheid voor flexibiliteit en voor (vernieuwende) initiatieven. Dit alles met het doel dat het CZSK altijd voldoende, goed gekwalificeerd en goed gemotiveerd personeel heeft om zijn taken uit te voeren.



Het CZSK is bezig met de hr-transitie naar het nieuwe r-model, als onderdeel van het defensiebrede programma hr-transitie. Een onderdeel van dit hr-model is de toepassing van hr-analytics (HR-A). HR-A is ondergebracht binnen de hr-dataregiecel. Deze regiecel is onder andere verantwoordelijk voor de CZSK-brede inrichting van HR-A en vormt vanuit CZSK voor HR-A het koppelvlak met de Bestuursstaf. Door het toepassen van HR-A werkt de hr-dataregiecel toe naar het voeren van regie op de personeellogistieke keten van CZSK. Proeven bij de hr-groepen zijn hiervoor de basis.



Deze functie valt binnen de tijdelijke formatie van de hr-transitie en is ondergebracht bij het bureau Aansturing en Regie.

**Teamleider Research IT-Support**


Impact, maatschappelijke relevantie én een goede werk-privébalans. Daar kun je op rekenen in deze baan bij het ICT Shared Service Centre (ISSC) van de Universiteit Leiden. Wil jij werken aan hoogstaande IT bij een van de meest gerenommeerde universiteiten van Europa? Bouw dan bij het ISSC mee aan de campus van de toekomst waar virtueel en fysiek studeren, onderzoeken en werken samengaan.

  

**Dit ga je doen**  

Als Teamleider Research IT-Support geef je leiding aan twee teams die een cruciale rol spelen in het ondersteunen van onderzoek: Research ICT Competence Centre (RICC) en Generic Research Application Services (GRAS). Je hebt een focus die zich uitstrekt van leidinggeven tot strategische aspecten, zoals het bepalen van teamdoelen in lijn met de organisatiestrategie. Door het creëren van synergie stimuleer jij de teams om succesvol te functioneren en zo het wetenschappelijk onderzoek optimaal te ondersteunen. Je hebt hiermee een belangrijke rol richting het onderzoeksdomein buiten het ISSC en fungeert als een boegbeeld. Je wordt betrokken bij relevante ontwikkelingen in de afdeling en organisatie waarbij je rapporteert aan het afdelingshoofd van de afdeling Customer Application Services (CAS).

**Concreet houd je je bezig met:**

* Zorgdragen voor synergie tussen beide teams, de teams en het ISSC en het Research Projectportfolio.
* Leidinggeven aan de professionals van de twee teams en zorgdragen voor een positieve werkomgeving, werkplezier en welzijn van je medewerkers.
* Voeren van functioneringsgesprekken en het stimuleren van persoonlijke ontwikkeling.
* Bijdragen aan de verdere ontwikkeling van een visie op de rol van ICT in Research Support, waaronder het HPC rekencluster, en deze vertalen naar concrete nieuwe of verbeterde diensten of uitbreiding van bestaande diensten, (afdelings)plannen en begroting in samenspraak met het afdelingshoofd.
* Samenwerken met de product owners, technical leads en scrum masters van beide teams om de prioriteiten en doelen af te stemmen en behalen, zoals het continu verbeteren van de onderzoeksdiensten en security.
* Onderhouden van een goede relatie met onderzoekers en fungeren als aanspreekpunt.
* Vertegenwoordigen van de beide teams in diverse afdeling-, project- en agile events

  

**Hier ga je werken**  

Het ICT Shared Service Centre (ISSC) is de ICT-dienstverlener van de Universiteit Leiden, een van Europa’s meest vooraanstaande internationale onderzoeksuniversiteiten. Met ongeveer 150 collega’s produceren en leveren wij moderne en flexibele ICT-diensten voor onze universitaire researchers, docenten, 32.000 studenten en bedrijfsvoering.


Wij ontwikkelen en beheren onder andere state-of-the-art (mobiele) workspaces en moderniseren continu het geavanceerde ICT-netwerk en onze private-cloud omgeving. Naast het applicatiebeheer van de informatiesystemen voor bedrijfsvoering en onderwijs, ontwikkelen en beheren we robuuste universitaire rekenfaciliteiten en storage voorzieningen, meerdere datacenters en een supercomputer. Dit alles binnen een continu veranderende omgeving waarbij we steeds meer in energieke teams agile werken.


Je bent in deze functie de teamleider van de teams Research ICT Competence Centre en Generic Research Application Services. De teams bestaan uit engineers, functioneel beheerders, applicatiebeheerders, en een product owner en business analist voor beide teams samen. Beide teams ondersteunen onderzoekers en onderzoeksgroepen binnen de instituten, labs en faculteiten van onze universiteit. RICC ontwikkelt, realiseert en onderhoudt specifieke ICT-infrastructuur, waaronder een supercomputing faciliteit (HPC). GRAS faciliteert onderzoekers en onderzoeksgroepen bij het samenwerken aan data en code via generieke onderzoeksdiensten en applicaties.

Wij zoeken iemand die snel zelfstandig aan de slag kan en zich thuis voelt in zowel IT als de onderzoekswereld. Elke functie is anders dus er is in het begin aandacht voor het verkrijgen van inzicht in de technische aspecten van research ICT-infrastructuur, applicaties en onderzoeksdiensten. Deze functie past bij jou als je je herkent in de volgende punten:

* Je beschikt over minimaal een HBO-diploma in een relevant ICT vakgebied.
* Je hebt aantoonbare ervaring als leidinggevende in een vergelijkbare Research Support context.

Vlak voordat je de dag afsluit, zet je alle offers live die je die dag gebouwd of gewijzigd hebt. Spannend! Hoe zullen onze klanten op deze boodschap reageren?


Naast deze reguliere werkzaamheden zijn er diverse mogelijkheden om je te ontwikkelen binnen het team, bijvoorbeeld door het organiseren van leuke activiteiten, scrummaster werkzaamheden, of het uitvoeren van uitgebreidere analyses op campagnes.

Inmiddels telt onze familie meer dan vierhonderd collega’s in Nederland, Duitsland en België. We schrijven bewust ‘familie’, want we delen niet dezelfde achternaam, maar wel dezelfde passie, interesse in elkaar en onze klanten.

* Het salaris is aantrekkelijk, denk in de range van 4500 tot 6500 euro per maand (bruto, 40 uur per week), met jaarlijks een inflatiecorrectie, een periodeverhoging afhankelijk van je prestaties en een bonusregeling;
* Ben je ambitieus? Er is volop mogelijkheid om door te groeien in onze organisatie;

Een Omni-Contact aanpak moet ervoor zorgen dat CCEP haar ambitie, om via verschillende kanalen contact te onderhouden met een zo groot mogelijk deel van ons klantuniversum, kan realiseren. Samenhang en consistentie tussen deze verschillende contacten is daarin cruciaal voor het realiseren van een optimale klantervaring.

Wij bezoeken, bellen en mailen onze klanten. Ook kunnen ze 24/7 terecht op MyCCEP. Het is aan jou de meest effectieve inzet te bepalen voor telefonische communicatie richting onze klanten (outbound) met ons externe call center. Bij ons externe call center werkt deels een vast team en deels een flexibele schil die voor CCEP bellen, gemiddeld belt een team van 12 personen. Dit team stuur je samen met het externe call center aan. Voor de meest effectieve inzet hou je rekening met de marketingkalender, bezoeken vanuit het Field Sales team én de mailcampagnes binnen de diverse Out of Home kanalen.

**Over Coca-Cola Europacific Partners**  

7 miljoen drankjes per dag produceren, distribueren en verkopen. Daar zijn we goed in bij Coca-Cola Europacific Partners. Onze iconische producten zijn altijd even verfrissend en passend bij allerlei settings. Denk aan Coca-Cola, Fuze Tea of Royal Bliss. En ons succes is allemaal te danken aan zo’n 33.000 collega’s.

Ja is ja en je maakt waar wat je belooft. En we weten: ‘nee’ is ook een antwoord.  

Je houdt van de combinatie Sales & Marketing en bent pas tevreden als alle doelen behaald zijn en de klant blij met ons is. Je bent niet bang om je mening te geven, mensen uit te dagen en met ideeën te komen. Je bent goed in het verdelen van je aandacht en tijd over verschillende stakeholders en projecten.

De IND staat extern continu in de aandacht en ontwikkelt zich intern daardoor ook continu. De dynamiek in de directies is daardoor groot en de daarmee gepaard gaande HR uitdagingen dus ook.



Wat ga je doen?



“Als HR adviseur binnen de IND is geen dag hetzelfde. De IND en HR zijn continu in ontwikkeling. Voor één van de directies ben jij het eerste aanspreekpunt voor operationeel managers op HR-gebied. Zo schakel je de ene dag met een arbeidsjurist; de volgende dag heb je een overleg met een re-ïntegratie adviseur om een casus te bespreken. Jij bent de spin in het web op het gebied van HR en zet expertise in waar nodig. Kortom, een dynamische baan met veel verantwoordelijkheden en uitdagingen!”



Hoe ziet een werkweek/dag eruit:



Je week begint bijvoorbeeld met een digitale weekstart met de HR collega’s die voor dezelfde directie werken. Tijdens dit overleg bespreek je zaken waar je tegen aan loopt en/of waar je input voor nodig hebt. Je kunt bijvoorbeeld denken aan een afdeling waar vitaliteit en werkplezier naar een hoger niveau getilt kunnen worden. Doordeweeks heb je bilaterale overleggen (bila’s) met managers. De leidinggevenden bij de IND zijn integraal verantwoordelijk, dus ook voor hun personeelszaken. Jij bent hun eerste aanspreekpunt bij HR-vragen. Als er diepgaandere expertise nodig is, verbind jij de manager met de beschikbare specialisten binnen de IND of Organisatie en Personeel (O&P) Rijk en bewaakt het verloop van de ondersteuning.



De voornaamste elementen in jouw rol zijn:



De operationeel managers ondersteunen en adviseren op HR gebied, onder andere op het gebied van:



* de aanpak van rechtspositionele trajecten (waar nodig met advies van de tweedelijns dienstverleners (O&P Rijk);


* bezwaar- en beroepstrajecten (met inzet van O&P Rijk);


* de toepassing van regels binnen de kaders en regelgeving;


* over verzuim en -preventie, wet verbetering poortwachter trajecten en langdurig of frequent zieke medewerkers;


* Sociaal Medisch Team.


* Je zoekt zaken uit en haalt informatie op bij verschillende experts voordat je een advies geeft – netwerken is hierin heel erg belangrijk;
* Je bekijkt een casus vanuit verschillende invalshoeken voordat je over gaat tot het geven van een advies;
* Je draagt daarnaast, vanuit jouw inzicht in wat er in de organisatie speelt, IND-breed bij aan diverse (HR) thema’s – je kunt hierbij denken aan bijvoorbeeld duurzame inzetbaarheid, talentonwikkeling, IND Academie, managementinformatie/ HR Analytics of diversiteit & inclusie.


Verder heb je eens in de twee weken het HR adviesoverleg waar je je directe collega’s ziet en actuele HR thema’s met elkaar bespreekt. Je sluit periodiek aan bij Management Team (MT)-overleg van de managers die je ondersteunt. Je bent professioneel betrokken en je gaat slagvaardig, doortastend en resultaatgericht te werk. Je houdt in je adviezen en producten rekening met relevante HR-ontwikkelingen en volgt daarin de interne en externe actualiteiten. Timemanagement is cruciaal als HR adviseur; overleggen is een onderdeel van de functie maar je maakt ook ruimte om je adviezen uit te werken.



Wat de functie nog extra leuk maakt:



Als nieuwe HR adviseur binnen de IND beland je in een warm bad, met vriendelijke collega’s waar je altijd bij terecht kunt. Je krijgt de ruimte om jezelf verder te ontwikkelen en te anticiperen op actuele thema’s die op dat moment spelen. De IND hanteert het werkmodel van het Hybride werken, waar we samen invulling aan geven. Hierbij hebben medewerkers de ruimte om – in overleg met collega’s, klanten en manager - bewuste keuzes te maken in hoe, wanneer, met wie en waar wordt (samen)gewerkt: op een kantoor, op locatie, thuis of elders.


  
Functie-eisen

De HR adviseur die wij zoeken is een goede luisteraar en een sterke verbinder en weet de aanwezige expertise en kennis bij de afdeling HR en de specialisten van O&P Rijk adequaat in te zetten voor de adviserende dienstverlening richting managers.

Je houdt goed controle over de voortgang van lopende zaken en bent elke dag bezig om jezelf verder te verbeteren en te ontwikkelen.



Jouw thuisbasis met het team HR advies is Den Haag, waar we zo veel mogelijk elke donderdag met heel HR aanwezig zijn. Daarnaast ben je bereid om op locaties door het hele land te werken, voor het persoonlijk contact met de managers aan wie je adviseert.

**Meer over jouw toekomstige afdeling**
---------------------------------------



Bedrijfsvoering zorgt ervoor dat de IND als concern en de keten als geheel hun taken zo goed mogelijk kunnen uitvoeren. De directie wil haar klanten (alle IND-collega’s en vele ketenpartners) snel en vakkundig bedienen: met een brede blik op het gebied van HR, financiën, control, Lean, interne audits, huisvesting en facilitaire voorzieningen. Dat betekent dat wij weten wat onze klanten nu maar ook in de toekomst nodig hebben, zodat we duurzame en toekomstbestendige (integrale) adviezen en diensten leveren.



De directie Bedrijfsvoering bestaat uit de directeur en een aantal MT-leden, die verantwoordelijk zijn voor de onderliggende afdelingen van BV. De directeur en MT-leden worden ondersteund door managementondersteuners. De inhoudelijke ondersteuning van (plaatsvervangend) directeur en de overige MT-leden vindt plaats door directie- en afdelingssecretarissen. De managementondersteuners, de secretarissen en de informatiemanagers vormen de Staf van de directie Bedrijfsvoering.



Afdeling Human Resources



Om een toekomstbestendige organisatie te zijn, moet de IND in staat zijn om haar werkwijze snel aan te passen aan de nieuwe werkelijkheid. Dat vraagt om een fundamentele doorontwikkeling van een nieuwe manier van werken (zelforganisatie) met daarop toegesneden leiderschap en medewerkerschap. Medewerkers die verantwoordelijkheid nemen en voelen voor hun werk, hun ontwikkeling en (verdere) professionalisering. Leiderschap dat steeds minder inhoudelijk en operationeel is, meer dienend en sturend, met meer ruimte voor strategie en verbinding en gericht op het ondersteunen van medewerkers in hun vakmanschap en ontwikkeling.



De afdeling HR bestaat uit de volgende teams:


* HR Advies;
* IND Academie;
* Beleid, Innovatie en Ontwikkeling (BIO) Beleid (BIO–Beleid);
* Management Informatie en Toegang (MIT);
* Werving, Selectie en Ondersteuning (WSO);
* Ambtelijke Ondersteuning Medezeggenschap (AOM).
**Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst**
--------------------------------------



Een vluchteling die niet veilig is in eigen land. Een ingenieur die zijn kennis in Nederland in de praktijk komt brengen. En een gezin dat elkaar na jaren weer in de armen kan sluiten. Wat ze met elkaar gemeen hebben? De IND beoordeelt hun verzoeken om in Nederland te mogen wonen of Nederlander te willen worden.  

  

De IND voert het vreemdelingenbeleid in Nederland uit. Dat betekent dat we alle verblijfsaanvragen beoordelen. Het kan daarbij gaan om vluchtelingen die niet veilig zijn in eigen land en daarom hier asiel aanvragen. Of om mensen die hier willen werken, studeren, of een gezin vormen met iemand die hier al woont. Maar het kan ook gaan om mensen die hier al zo lang wonen dat zij zich Nederlander voelen en die daarom via een naturalisatieverzoek een Nederlands paspoort aanvragen.  

  

De IND wil een compacte en wendbare uitvoeringsorganisatie zijn met hoogwaardige kennis op het vreemdelingendomein en met oog voor de menselijke maat. De IND moet kunnen inspelen op wisselende eisen en omstandigheden en tegelijkertijd moet de kwaliteit van dienstverlening voorop blijven staan. Dit vraagt om een proactieve organisatie die zich voortdurend ontwikkelt. Daarvoor zijn medewerkers nodig die dit willen en kunnen ondersteunen. Medewerkers die breed inzetbaar zijn en die willen investeren in hun persoonlijke ontwikkeling. De IND investeert graag in deze medewerkers!

Dat de wereld van Data & Analytics zich steeds aan het ontwikkelen is, schrikt jouw niet af. Sterker nog, dat is de reden waarom deze baan jou ook zo gaaf lijkt! Jaarbeurs is een omgeving waar het hebben van relevante data van groot belang is en het staat hoog op de agenda. Alleen daarmee kunnen we waardevolle ontmoetingen voor onze bezoekers en exposanten organiseren.



De afgelopen twee jaren is hard gewerkt aan het opzetten van een Azure datawarehouse en PowerBI dashboarding. We maken zoveel mogelijk gebruik van ons eigen automation framework om repetitieve taken te vereenvoudigen. Daarnaast is een customer data platform geïmplementeerd waarmee we de customer journey van onze klanten kunnen verbeteren. Het aantal dashboards en gebruikers is aan het groeien en er liggen nog veel mooie uitdagingen om het data platform verder te ontwikkelen. Ook op gebied van data integraties, welke we ontwikkelen met Make. Op dit moment onderzoeken we hoe we data governance gaan inrichten en bekijken we de mogelijkheden van een lakehouse architectuur met Microsoft Fabric. De ambitie is om beslissingen te nemen op basis van data en een toekomstbestendig data platform op te zetten om aan de veranderende eisen te kunnen voldoen. We kijken hierbij niet alleen in de achteruitkijkspiegel, maar ons vizier is vol op de toekomst gericht. Jaarbeurs is hard op weg de meest duurzame en technologische venue te worden en we zoeken iemand die energie krijgt om hieraan mee te bouwen.  



**Dit vind je leuk om te doen**  

Ons Data & Analytics team bestaat uit 6 collega’s. We werken volgens de scrum methodiek en zijn ook echt zelfsturend. Het team is multidisciplinair, maar ieder heeft zijn eigen specialisme. We werken hard, houden elkaar scherp en vullen elkaar aan. Er kan en mag veel, en we houden van slim samenwerken. Je gaat het volgende doen:


* Ontwikkelen en onderhouden van het data platform. Je ontsluit databronnen, automatiseert ETL processen en modelleert data t.b.v. datamarts, dashboards en analyses
* Ontwikkelen en onderhouden van data integraties tussen applicaties
* Op basis van informatiebehoeften adviseren over (nieuwe) functionele en technische oplossingsmogelijkheden. Je kan de functionele vraag omzetten naar de techniek en bent in staat om verwachtingen te managen door goede proactieve communicatie
* Het bewaken van de kwaliteit van de opgeleverde functionaliteiten en reviewen samen met teamleden en eindgebruikers

  

**Wat breng jij mee?**  

Jij hebt kwaliteit hoog in het vaandel staan, hebt aandacht voor detail en werkt nauwgezet. Je hebt goed ontwikkelde communicatieve vaardigheden en houdt van een omgeving die volop in beweging is. Je laat je niet snel uit het veld slaan als zaken anders lopen, maar bent oplossingsgericht.


* Je beschikt over hbo/wo denk- en werkniveau met sterke analytische en technische vaardigheden en je hebt minimaal 2 tot 5 jaar werkervaring in een soortgelijke rol zoals bijvoorbeeld Junior Data Engineer of Junior BI Specialist
* Je hebt ervaring met data en dashboarding platformen, bij voorkeur de Microsoft stack (SQL Server, Data Factory, PowerBI)
* Je bent bekend met concepten zoals data management, data modellering (dimensioneel modelleren), delta lakes, row level security, ELT en data lineage
* Je weet je goed in te leven in de (interne) klant en bent professioneel kritisch. Je kunt goed luisteren en vraagt actief door

https://nl.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=1cd3d2cfb6504d58,indeed,Javascript Developer,SQUADRA,https://nl.indeed.com/cmp/Squadra,"Leerdam, UT, NL","parttime, fulltime",2024-06-17,,,,,False,,,"hans.heutink@squadra.nl, Irene.vanrosmalen@squadra.nl","**De uitdaging**  

Veel bedrijven kampen met groeiende uitdagingen rondom een duidelijke ‘source of truth’ als het om hun data gaat. Vaak is er enorm veel data beschikbaar, hebben meerdere stakeholders toegang tot deze data en worden bedrijfskritische beslissingen genomen op basis van deze data. Om alle data componenten op een juiste manier met elkaar te verbinden, zodat je te allen tijden beschikt over de juiste data, is het hebben van één ‘source of truth’ belangrijk. En hierbij geldt vaak, hoe groter het bedrijf, hoe groter de moeilijkheidsgraad op dit gebied. Dit zorgt ervoor dat de grootste bedrijven in Nederland Squadra om hulp vragen.  

  

Bij de Squadra MDM Factory bouwen en ontwerpen we dit datafundament met behulp van de Master Data Management pakketten van onze partners. Of er nu een bestaand platform moet worden geoptimaliseerd of er vanuit een greenfield-project een oplossing wordt gecreëerd, wij ontwerpen en implementeren deze oplossingen. We werken in teams nauw samen met zowel de klant als mede-Squadrianen. Hierbij is een prettige werksfeer minstens zo belangrijk als het neerzetten van goede resultaten.  

  

**Dit ga je doen:**
* Implementeren en configureren van de oplossing in de Master Data Management (MDM) en Product Information Management (PIM) software van onze partners, waarbij je je kennis van deze MDM/PIM systemen benut om er het maximale voor de klant uit te halen. Door de complexe business processen van de klant is het begrijpen van datastromen en het schrijven van javascript code in dit onderdeel essentieel.
* Mogelijke oplossingen bedenken waar je een demo/proof of concept van bouwt. Je adviseert over de verschillende mogelijkheden, waarbij je de gekozen oplossing gedetailleerd specificeert.
* Het modelleren van datastructuren. Hierdoor worden er op gestructureerde manier producten beheerd en geoptimaliseerd.
* Je werkt aan het implementeren van integraties tussen het MDM/PIM systeem en externe systemen (ERP, Datapools, API’s, market places, etc). Hiervoor werk je nauw samen met verschillende teams van de klant, in een adviserende ondersteunende en/of uitvoerende rol.
* Het ontwikkelen van ‘tailor made’ dashboards voor de eindgebruiker.
* Delen van kennis en ‘best practices’ met de klant, key users en functioneel beheerders. Van tijd tot tijd geef je workshops, trainingen en zorg je voor een goede documentatie en overdracht.


  

**Wat neem je mee:**
* Je beschikt over een HBO/WO werk- en denkniveau, of vergelijkbare relevante werkervaring
* Minimaal twee jaar ervaring met Javascript of Python
* Ervaring met applicatiebeheer en het werken met databases en datastromen is (ook) een goede basis.
* Ervaring met PIM en/of MDM is gewenst. Heb je die ervaring nog niet? Geen probleem, dan leer je dit bij ons.
* Heb je ervaring bij een consultancy bedrijf is dat zeker een pre
* Je bent oplossingsgericht en hebt oog voor detail. Kwaliteit staat hoog bij je in het vaandel.
* Je hebt goede communicatieve vaardigheden, in zowel de Nederlandse als Engelse taal
* Je vindt het leuk om op locatie bij klanten te werken.

  

  

**Wat bieden wij jou?**


Je krijgt de vrijheid om - gebruikmakend van de applicaties en systemen waarmee we werken - je creativiteit in te zetten om mooie oplossingen te bedenken voor de klant. Naast een mooi salaris bieden we je in ieder geval:


* 25 vakantiedagen, met de optie om vakantiedagen bij te kopen
* 8% vakantiegeld
* Leaseauto
* Mogelijkheid om 32-40 uur te werken
* Macbook of Windows laptop naar keuze
* Telefoonvergoeding
* Bijdrage voor de oude dag (ten behoeve van een lijfrente polis)
* Jaarcontract met uitzicht op een vast contract na een jaar.
* Opleidingsmogelijkheden: we kennen veel manieren om onze collega’s te helpen met hun (persoonlijke) ontwikkeling bij Squadra. Zo kun je bijvoorbeeld trainingen volgen bij de verschillende Academies (bijv Stibo Step of Syndigo), events bezoeken, en werken we met een buddysysteem.
* Hybride werken


  

**Waarom wil je werken bij Squadra?**
* We zijn een kennisgedreven organisatie en daar zijn we trots op. Het is ons fundament en het verbindt onze mensen.
* Je hebt het familiaire gevoel van een klein bedrijf, maar je werkt met grote klanten. En we kennen geen interne politiek of bureaucratie, wel zo fijn!
* Kwaliteit leveren vinden we belangrijk, dat zie je terug in ons werk. Wij doen het liever ‘first time right’. Dit is ook een reden dat klanten graag met ons werken.
* Er is een verscheidenheid aan opdrachten en MDM pakketten waarmee we werken. Zo werken we veel met Stibo Step, en ook met Syndigo, Contentserv en SRC.
* Je krijgt ruimte om te leren en jezelf te ontwikkelen; denk bijvoorbeeld aan het volgen van trainingen en certificatie aan de Academy van Stibo Step of Syndigo, of een training om je engineer of consultancy skills te verbeteren of verdiepen. Als je bij ons start, word je gekoppeld aan een Squadra buddy en krijg je persoonlijke begeleiding van ons.
* Vanuit ons krijg je het volledige vertrouwen. Bij de klant ben jij het gezicht van Squadra.
* We werken hybride: op locatie bij de klant, vanuit huis of op ons kantoor in Leerdam/Utrecht.
* Squadra beslaat het hele spectrum van data diensten: van advies tot het bouwen van MDM/PIM oplossingen, Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Consultancy en e-Commerce oplossingen.


  

**Sollicitatieprocedure**
* Het eerste gesprek is met onze recruiter Irene. In een kort telefoongesprek (20 min) vertelt zij jou meer over de rol, Squadra en beantwoordt zij jouw vragen.


* Ben je enthousiast, dan plannen we een videogesprek in met jou, Hans Heutink (Managing director) en Irene (Recruiter); hier gaan we dieper in op jouw wensen, ervaring en ambities, en hoe Squadra hier aan kan bijdragen. En natuurlijk is er alle ruimte voor vragen.


* Het vervolggesprek is op kantoor of via video en zal met 2 collega’s van Squadra zijn; hierbij wordt dieper ingegaan op jouw ervaring en werkzaamheden, en kijken we of er een wederzijdse klik is.


* Daarna volgt een arbeidsvoorwaarden voorstel en bespreken we dat live of via de telefoon met je.



  

Ons proces duurt ongeveer 2-3 weken vanaf jouw sollicitatie tot het laatste gesprek, en de afspraken plant onze recruiter samen met jou in. Een van de gesprekken zal altijd een face-to-face gesprek zijn op kantoor, samen bepalen we hoe dit makkelijk te organiseren is.

Veel bedrijven kampen met groeiende uitdagingen rondom een duidelijke ‘source of truth’ als het om hun data gaat. Vaak is er enorm veel data beschikbaar, hebben meerdere stakeholders toegang tot deze data en worden bedrijfskritische beslissingen genomen op basis van deze data. Om alle data componenten op een juiste manier met elkaar te verbinden, zodat je te allen tijden beschikt over de juiste data, is het hebben van één ‘source of truth’ belangrijk. En hierbij geldt vaak, hoe groter het bedrijf, hoe groter de moeilijkheidsgraad op dit gebied. Dit zorgt ervoor dat de grootste bedrijven in Nederland Squadra om hulp vragen.  

  

Bij de Squadra MDM Factory bouwen en ontwerpen we dit datafundament met behulp van de Master Data Management pakketten van onze partners. Of er nu een bestaand platform moet worden geoptimaliseerd of er vanuit een greenfield-project een oplossing wordt gecreëerd, wij ontwerpen en implementeren deze oplossingen. We werken in teams nauw samen met zowel de klant als mede-Squadrianen. Hierbij is een prettige werksfeer minstens zo belangrijk als het neerzetten van goede resultaten.  

  

**Dit ga je doen:**
* Implementeren en configureren van de oplossing in de Master Data Management (MDM) en Product Information Management (PIM) software van onze partners, waarbij je je kennis van deze MDM/PIM systemen benut om er het maximale voor de klant uit te halen. Door de complexe business processen van de klant is het begrijpen van datastromen en het schrijven van javascript code in dit onderdeel essentieel.
* Mogelijke oplossingen bedenken waar je een demo/proof of concept van bouwt. Je adviseert over de verschillende mogelijkheden, waarbij je de gekozen oplossing gedetailleerd specificeert.
* Het modelleren van datastructuren. Hierdoor worden er op gestructureerde manier producten beheerd en geoptimaliseerd.
* Je werkt aan het implementeren van integraties tussen het MDM/PIM systeem en externe systemen (ERP, Datapools, API’s, market places, etc). Hiervoor werk je nauw samen met verschillende teams van de klant, in een adviserende ondersteunende en/of uitvoerende rol.
* Het ontwikkelen van ‘tailor made’ dashboards voor de eindgebruiker.
* Delen van kennis en ‘best practices’ met de klant, key users en functioneel beheerders. Van tijd tot tijd geef je workshops, trainingen en zorg je voor een goede documentatie en overdracht.


  

**Wat neem je mee:**
* Je beschikt over een HBO/WO werk- en denkniveau, of vergelijkbare relevante werkervaring
* Minimaal twee jaar ervaring met Javascript of Python
* Ervaring met applicatiebeheer en het werken met databases en datastromen is (ook) een goede basis.
* Ervaring met PIM en/of MDM is gewenst. Heb je die ervaring nog niet? Geen probleem, dan leer je dit bij ons.
* Heb je ervaring bij een consultancy bedrijf is dat zeker een pre
* Je bent oplossingsgericht en hebt oog voor detail. Kwaliteit staat hoog bij je in het vaandel.
* Je hebt goede communicatieve vaardigheden, in zowel de Nederlandse als Engelse taal
* Je vindt het leuk om op locatie bij klanten te werken.

  

  

**Wat bieden wij jou?**


Je krijgt de vrijheid om - gebruikmakend van de applicaties en systemen waarmee we werken - je creativiteit in te zetten om mooie oplossingen te bedenken voor de klant. Naast een mooi salaris bieden we je in ieder geval:


* 25 vakantiedagen, met de optie om vakantiedagen bij te kopen
* 8% vakantiegeld
* Leaseauto
* Mogelijkheid om 32-40 uur te werken
* Macbook of Windows laptop naar keuze
* Telefoonvergoeding
* Bijdrage voor de oude dag (ten behoeve van een lijfrente polis)
* Jaarcontract met uitzicht op een vast contract na een jaar.
* Opleidingsmogelijkheden: we kennen veel manieren om onze collega’s te helpen met hun (persoonlijke) ontwikkeling bij Squadra. Zo kun je bijvoorbeeld trainingen volgen bij de verschillende Academies (bijv Stibo Step of Syndigo), events bezoeken, en werken we met een buddysysteem.
* Hybride werken


  

**Waarom wil je werken bij Squadra?**
* We zijn een kennisgedreven organisatie en daar zijn we trots op. Het is ons fundament en het verbindt onze mensen.
* Je hebt het familiaire gevoel van een klein bedrijf, maar je werkt met grote klanten. En we kennen geen interne politiek of bureaucratie, wel zo fijn!
* Kwaliteit leveren vinden we belangrijk, dat zie je terug in ons werk. Wij doen het liever ‘first time right’. Dit is ook een reden dat klanten graag met ons werken.
* Er is een verscheidenheid aan opdrachten en MDM pakketten waarmee we werken. Zo werken we veel met Stibo Step, en ook met Syndigo, Contentserv en SRC.
* Je krijgt ruimte om te leren en jezelf te ontwikkelen; denk bijvoorbeeld aan het volgen van trainingen en certificatie aan de Academy van Stibo Step of Syndigo, of een training om je engineer of consultancy skills te verbeteren of verdiepen. Als je bij ons start, word je gekoppeld aan een Squadra buddy en krijg je persoonlijke begeleiding van ons.
* Vanuit ons krijg je het volledige vertrouwen. Bij de klant ben jij het gezicht van Squadra.
* We werken hybride: op locatie bij de klant, vanuit huis of op ons kantoor in Leerdam/Utrecht.
* Squadra beslaat het hele spectrum van data diensten: van advies tot het bouwen van MDM/PIM oplossingen, Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Consultancy en e-Commerce oplossingen.


  

**Sollicitatieprocedure**
* Het eerste gesprek is met onze recruiter Irene. In een kort telefoongesprek (20 min) vertelt zij jou meer over de rol, Squadra en beantwoordt zij jouw vragen.


* Ben je enthousiast, dan plannen we een videogesprek in met jou, Hans Heutink (Managing director) en Irene (Recruiter); hier gaan we dieper in op jouw wensen, ervaring en ambities, en hoe Squadra hier aan kan bijdragen. En natuurlijk is er alle ruimte voor vragen.

Ons proces duurt ongeveer 2-3 weken vanaf jouw sollicitatie tot het laatste gesprek, en de afspraken plant onze recruiter samen met jou in. Een van de gesprekken zal altijd een face-to-face gesprek zijn op kantoor, samen bepalen we hoe dit makkelijk te organiseren is.

Job description


For end-stage heart failure patients on the waiting list for a donor heart, mechanical pumps implanted in their chest are often their only option to survive. Given the high risks and severe discomfort of these devices, there is a strong need for soft circulatory devices that accurately replicate the natural motion of the heart.



In this project, you will computationally optimize soft robotic ventricle designs, additively manufacture them, and perform extensive static and dynamic experiments to quantify the soft robotic ventricle's acute and chronic performance, its efficiency, and its durability in response to realistic cardiovascular loading conditions.



The research will be conducted in the Department of BioMechanical Engineering at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) under the supervision of dr. ir. Mathias Peirlinck and dr. ir. Aimée Sakes. The Peirlinck Lab integrates multimodal experimental data, physics-based modeling, and machine learning techniques to understand, explore, and predict the multiscale behavior of the human heart and cardiovascular system. More information on the team and research can be found on https://peirlincklab.com.



Prior experience in finite element analysis, mathematical and numerical modeling of soft matter mechanics, additive manufacturing, and experimental device testing are required. As the successful candidate for this position, you will direct the research project at hand. You will actively participate in (bi)weekly lab meetings, write scientific articles, and take part in teaching and supervision activities within the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of Delft University of Technology.


Requirements

Hou je graag veel ballen in de lucht en weet je met mandaat om te gaan? Dan zoeken we jou!


**Jouw impact als Business Analist Finance**
--------------------------------------------


Je analyseert de impact van wijzigingen in processen, systemen en het product. Jij bent de schakel tussen de business, productontwikkeling en IT. Én (dit is natuurlijk nog het allerbelangrijkste) je bent in staat om constant door de bril van de klant te kijken. Dit zijn de deelnemers en werkgevers met een pensioenregeling bij BeFrank. Wat de rol van Business Analist Finance bij BeFrank anders maakt? Als Business Analist Finance bij BeFrank moet je er van houden om met (veel) verschillende dingen tegelijk bezig te zijn. We werken in onze eigen(wijze) vorm van Agile/Scrum. Je bent dus steeds met verschillende features bezig. De strategische doelen van het bedrijf vertaal je naar de realiteit. En omdat we een kleine wendbare organisatie zijn, zie je direct wat je hebt bedacht in de praktijk terug! Je krijgt veel verantwoordelijkheid en inspraak maar dit kan ook een valkuil zijn. Jouw doel is om het helder, eenvoudig en online voor iedereen te maken. Als iedereen het snapt, ben jij tevreden.


**Met wie je werkt**
--------------------


Bij BeFrank werken zo’n 110 mensen, waarvan ongeveer 55 in het IT team. We werken in vier DevOps teams bestaande uit developers, een Product Owner, Business Analist en een Functioneel Beheerder. Eén van deze DevOps teams is het Finance IT team, hier zul jij als Business Analist in terecht komen. Daarnaast vorm je samen met de andere Business analisten, de UX-designer en de Data Scientist een hecht team. Je werkt nauw samen met je collega’s in je DevOps team. Al heb je in jouw rol eigenlijk contact met alle teams binnen BeFrank!


**Wat je gaat doen**
--------------------


* Vanuit keten- en proceskant analyses uitvoeren voor verbetering en innovatie van onze dienstverlening;
* Het in kaart brengen van de business wensen en deze vertalen naar concrete verbeterplannen en geoptimaliseerde processen;
* Het opstellen van requirements en deze uitwerken in user stories, waarbij je ook oog hebt voor de datakwaliteit;
* Deze analyses verder verfijnen met de development teams (zij de techniek, jij houdt het einddoel scherp);
* Mee testen waar nodig of in het testproces de rol van Business Analist borgen (o.a door mede opstellen en reviewen van testplannen);
* Een vraagbaak zijn voor de business, meedenken met de verschillende stakeholders en in alle meningen de juiste weg naar voren kiezen.

**Wat je meebrengt**
--------------------


Je hebt een afgeronde HBO- of WO-opleiding en minimaal 5 jaar werkervaring als Business Analist binnen de financiële dienstverlening. De Nederlandse taal beheers je vloeiend, en werken in een Agile omgeving is voor jou een tweede natuur. Ook heb je aantoonbare kennis van procesontwerpen. Je overziet de keten en kunt vanuit de keten denken. De taal van de developers begrijp je (maar het ontwikkelen zelf laat je natuurlijk aan hen over). Je bent een kei in samenwerken en verbindt collega’s met als doel samen tot een oplossing te komen. Jij wil het complete plaatje begrijpen en deinst er niet voor terug om net zo lang door te gaan tot je de benodigde informatie hebt. En heb jij al kennis van pensioen? Of ben je bekend met Exact, Salesforce, SQL, data analyse technieken en/of het werken in DevOps teams? Dan is dat een grote pre!


**Arbeidsvoorwaarden die bij jou passen**
-----------------------------------------


Behalve uitdagend werk binnen een omgeving waar jouw initiatief op prijs wordt gesteld, bieden wij jou een uitstekend arbeidsvoorwaardenpakket, dat bestaat uit:


* Passend salaris (Salarisschaal €3.308 – €6.615 afhankelijk van je kennis en ervaring)

***Develop AI for intelligent vehicles to make them anticipate unseen nearby traffic through acoustic perception of traffic sounds***


Job description


The Intelligent Vehicles group at TU Delft is seeking two PhD candidates to investigate the use of acoustic sensors, such as a microphone array, on a (self-driving) vehicle for detection and localization of external sounds from nearby traffic. The project is co-funded and co-supervised by NXP Semiconductors in Leuven.



Currently, Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Vehicles (AVs) rely on cameras, radars, and lidar sensors to detect nearby traffic . Nowadays AI and Machine Learning techniques achieve impressive detection performance for these sensors, however they are most useful in unobstructed areas (e.g. highway) within direct line-of-sight, and under specific environmental conditions (day time, no fog, etc.). In contrast, acoustic detection with vehicle-mounted microphones may help anticipate dangerous traffic situations when visibility is limited.



This project aims for completely novel AI approaches to detect nearby traffic using sound. Traffic produces specific acoustic signatures, including explicit sounds (car horns, sirens), but also tire noise of nearby vehicles, or even electric vehicles that are required by law to emit a recognizable sound when driving at low velocity. Using sound as an additional sensor can lead to safer automated driving, or even enable new forms of ADAS. For example, such sounds can indicate approaching vehicles around the corner while driving through narrow streets, or while exiting a blind parking spot. Detecting sirens will help an AV anticipate and localize emergency vehicles.



There are several challenges that will be addressed, divided over two PhD positions:


* Topic A) To identify promising ADAS applications that can benefit from acoustic sensing, design novel use case-specific solutions with Machine Learning and build a working proof-of-concept system to be tested in controlled real-world experiments for at least one application. The novel methods will only need to support the selected ADAS applications and should not extract more information than needed. By aiming for minimal hardware and computational resources, the practical value for ADAS is maximized.
* Topic B) To develop novel acoustic Deep Learning techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance in multi-sensor environment perception for autonomous driving. The models should provide holistic representations of all surrounding traffic by fusing acoustic with other sensor modalities. Such holistic traffic representations support many driving tasks at once, as required for full self-driving. The addition of acoustics should improve the robustness of the existing sensor suite.


The IV group’s Prius demonstrator vehicle with cameras, lidars, radars, and a roof-mounted microphone array will be used to investigate acoustic detection and localization salient traffic sounds. The project aims for viable real-time solutions and an online demonstration of acoustic ADAS


Requirements


* Completed (or about to complete) a MSc degree related to any of: artificial intelligence, machine learning, intelligent vehicles / robotics, acoustics and signal processing, computer vision.
* Good theoretic understanding of the fundamentals of Machine Learning.
* Ability to act independently as well as to collaborate effectively with members of a larger interdisciplinary team, take initiative, be result oriented, organized and creative.
* Excellent programming skills (Python, Matlab or C/C++).
* Good command of verbal and written English.


Desirable for topic A:


* Hands-on experience with real-world data collection in robotics, intelligent vehicles, or a related area.
* Experience in applying Machine Learning / Deep Learning to real-world data.
* Knowledge of acoustic signal processing (filtering, beamforming, direction of arrival, SRP-PHAT) is a plus.
* Knowledge of the Robot Operating System (ROS) is a plus.


Desirable for topic B:


* Demonstratable experience in applying Deep Learning, using PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX.
* Experience with robotic/vehicle perception, preferably acoustics, but experience with computer vision, lidar, radar perception is also a plus.


Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.


Conditions of employment

-------------------

*Have you ever analyzed some data and wondered whether there were better ways to come to the results?*  

*And, have you ever reflected on whether such results actually match with what you expected to find?*


These are just two of the questions that process mining analysts ask themselves when extracting insights from large event logs. Indeed, it can be challenging for analysts to keep track of the many steps and decisions they make, as there are many possible data analysis and cleaning steps—think of data selection or abstraction—that can be performed in many alternative ways, leading to different results. This makes it even more difficult for analysts to understand the impact of their analysis steps and choices on the results they obtain and validate that such results are aligned with their expectations and consistent with their analytical approach.


If this sounds like something you would be interested in, and you aim to help process scientists improve their analytical work, please read the job description below.


Process mining is an analytical discipline that focuses on extracting insights from event logs generated by the execution of work processes. As with other analytical disciplines, the significant involvement of human analysts to interpret raw event data and derive actionable insights remains critical. A key challenge in this area is the lack of support for analysts to reflect on and refine their analytical processes.


Our vision is to provide analysts with methods, algorithms, and tools that make them aware of how their decisions and steps relate to their analysis goals. We call this vision ""Explainable Process Analytics"" because it aims to enable process analysts to better understand their analysis processes and become more effective in choosing the right steps and making the right decisions for their current goal.


We’re looking for a PhD candidate to join the **Process Analytics on Multi-dimensional Data** group under the supervision of Dr. Francesca Zerbato and Dr. Dirk Fahland and help lay the foundations for realizing this vision of ""Explainable Process Analytics"".


The primary focus of your PhD work will be to develop novel methods, algorithms, and tools to support process mining analysts *by integrating the validation of analysis steps and results into the analysis process and into existing process mining techniques.*


This focus allows for different research directions you can pick from, such as:


* *Develop a framework for understanding the impact of data analysis steps.* Different analytical steps, such as filtering or abstraction, can have different effects on the data and the results of the analysis, depending on how they are performed. For example, consider what happens to sequence relationships when events are filtered out one at a time. In this task, you could focus on creating algorithms, methods, or visualizations to illustrate these effects, enabling analysts to evaluate and understand the implications of their analytical choices.
* *Investigate data structures and models for analytical provenance in process mining.* Analytical provenance captures the steps and choices made by analysts, allowing them to track their workflow and understand how results are generated. In this task, you could explore database models, ontologies, or other data representations to represent and query analytical provenance in process mining.
* *Develop methods to validate process mining results.* Process analysts need to validate their intermediate and final results based on properties—very often temporal properties about the execution of a process—that may be interesting to them or stakeholders. In this task, you could develop methods and tools to validate and compare intermediate results with ground truth data or based on user-defined properties.


These research directions give you the opportunity to learn and combine different types of research approaches, including


* Fundamental research in process mining, data models, and query languages;
* Development of algorithms, methods, and tools to support process mining analysts in their work;
* Empirical research to gather requirements from process mining analysts and validate your work with them.


Also, you will get in touch with different research fields, including process mining, databases and data analytics, and artificial intelligence. You will have the opportunity to define and shape the exact direction of your PhD work based on the listed tasks together with the research and supervision team.


Please, be aware that this is a Teaching PhD position. This means that throughout your PhD you will spend some time helping with the teaching of relevant courses (e.g., by running instruction sessions, and by correcting students' homework). You will also have the opportunity to obtain teaching qualifications.


**Job requirements**
--------------------

* You have a Master's degree (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Data Science or AI.
* You are able to work in an international team and are eager to collaborate with other team members and possible industry partners involved in this research.
* You are motivated to publish your research results at leading international conferences and to travel to present your work.
* You are open to working with different research methods, ranging from foundational research to tool development and empirical research to validate your findings.
* You are fluent in written and spoken English.
* You have some knowledge of process mining from your studies or work (preferred).

**Conditions of employment**
----------------------------


A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:


* Full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.
* Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the *Collective Labour Agreement* for Dutch Universities, scale P (min. €2,770 max. €3,539).
* A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
* High-quality training programs and other support to grow into a self-aware, autonomous scientific researcher. At TU/e we challenge you to take charge of your own learning process.
* An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
* An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
* A Staff Immigration Team and a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) for international candidates.

Are you passionate about the role microorganisms can play in the context of environmental health and the production of healthy drinking water, and do you want to work within an inspiring and multidisciplinary research team? We are looking for you!***  

  

River bank filtration (RBF) is a widely used nature-based technique to produce drinking water from surface water. Energy intensive post-treatment is often required, because pollutants are not always reliably removed. In the AQUIPURA project, we want to investigate pollutant removal in RBFs in its entirety ranging from organic micro-pollutants to viruses. AQUIPURA develops and employs novel mechanistic insights, monitoring, and modelling tools. AQUIPURA improves design and performance resulting in improved reliability of a contaminant-free, safe, green RBF system in times of urbanization and climate-change. AQUIPURA shares outcomes and knowledge in a Chinese-Dutch transdisciplinary consortium to assist in achieving a green nature-based, climate resilient drinking water supply.

Are you a passionate about microbiology in the context of health and do you want to work within an ambitious and multidisciplinary research team? We are looking for you!***  

  

Colorectal cancer survivors often suffer from treatment-related side-effects impacting their quality of life. Current adjuvant care involves chemotherapeutic management with the drugs oxaliplatin and capecitabine. However, determinants of chemotherapy-induced toxicities are unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota disturbances may play a role. Although dietary fibre is a known determinant of gut health, the impact of dietary fibre on management of chemotherapy side-effects remains unexplored.  

  

Therefore, we started the GEM-CARE project. GEM-CARE stands for: Gut Ecology Management for Cancer treatment and Recovery Enhancement. In this 4-year project, we will investigate the potential of dietary fibre in mitigating chemotherapy side-effects in individuals with colorectal cancer.  

  

**What will you do?**  

Within the GEM-CARE project you will:* conduct microbiological experiments in continuous culture systems to study how factors related to chemotherapy are impacting microbial composition and activity, and how these can be counteracted by dietary components. The UNLOCK infrastructure will be used for these incubations in which faeces collected from colon cancer patients will be used as inoculum;
* conduct the microbiological experiments, and analyse and interpret the collected data, which you will subsequently present in scientific papers, in a PhD-thesis and at (inter)national conferences;

However, often these disorders emerge gradually from (interactions between) psychological, physical, and environmental processes. In the proposed project we want to closely examine these processes on an intra-individual level using an interdisciplinary approach combining movement sciences, psychology, and psychiatry. Our aim is to provide a better understanding of the development of anxiety and depression, and test possibilities for (behavioural) action to facilitate recovery and return to normal development.



In this PhD-project we take a mixed-methods approach. First, the PhD student will explore the role of agency and affordances in the development of anxiety and depression through a scoping review and a qualitative study with individuals with a history of anxiety/depression. Next, we investigate the possibilities of recovering from depression/anxiety by increasing agency through movement and social interaction in our stress-lab. We use ecologically valid experiments to gather rich, highly detailed information of individuals over time, measuring movement behaviour (kinematic/kinetic time series), psychological experience (interviews/questionnaires) and physiological stress-response (heart rate variability).



The tasks of the PhD candidate are


* Conduct research that results in a dissertation and is in line with the objectives and requirements of the project.
* Organize and execute the data collection for the different studies.
* Publish the results of the research in international scientific journals.
* Present the research findings to fellow scientists and developers in the larger project, and collaborate with them.


Provide a limited number of educational activities at the Developmental Pyschology department, such as small-scale tutorials and guest lectures, in collaboration with the supervisors.

As a PhD candidate you will be working on a project entitled “Sticky Practices: The co-evolution of early years childcare, parental leave and women’s labour force participation” under the supervision of Sarah Carmichael, Robert Vonk and Tanja van der Lippe. The project aims to look at how the care of young children is arranged, and what this means for gendered division of labour.


**Your job**
------------


Early childhood education and care is a topic that receives attention both for its contributions to improving later schooling and development outcomes of the children themselves, and as an essential service for working parents (as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic). Reliable and widely available childcare is also essential to enable women’s work in particular. However, how this is provided, what the uptake is and what the further impact is on parental working patterns differs across countries. Given current Dutch proposals to make childcare free or heavily subsidised, this topic is pertinent to assess policy. This project aims to look at how (pre-)school childcare institutions have co-evolved with norms around mother’s work, maternity and paternity leave, postnatal care, etc. You will compare several countries representing a number of different child-care provision regimes and parental leave arrangements over the long-term to determine how various critical junctures have affected outcomes today. This will be done by research into the historical evolution and path dependency of these norms and arrangements.


You will conduct research into the history of childcare services and norms using a variety of sources and case-studies but with the Dutch case as the point of departure. In practice this means you will:


* conduct research in archives in the Netherlands as well as abroad;
* establish a systematic collection of data on childcare norms, policies and financial arrangements;
* attend and prepare material for PhD training sessions offered via SCOOP as well as via the Posthumus institute;
* present research findings and national and international conferences;
* help with knowledge dissemination activities of the findings of the project both within and outside academia;
* publish peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters.


**Your qualities**
------------------

* You hold a Master's degree in a relevant field (e.g history, sociology, economics, anthropology, political science or related discipline but with experience in historical research) at the time of taking up the appointment.
* You have excellent command of spoken and written English.
* Preferably you have a working knowledge of written Dutch in order to be able to conduct research on Dutch source material.
* Experience conducting historical archival research is an asset.
* Basic knowledge of statistics would be helpful but not a prerequisite.
* You are able to work independently as well as within a team setting and take initiative where needed.


**Our offer**
-------------

* a job for for 18 months starting 1 September 2024, with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the initial period, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period;
* a working week of 38 hours and a gross monthly salary between € 2.770,- and € 3.539,- in the case of full-time employment (salary scale P under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8.3% year-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees. This includes schemes facilitating professional development, leave schemes and schemes for sports and cultural activities, as well as discounts on software and other IT products.

Als Azure Data Engineer geef jij richting aan deze oplossingen en ontwikkel je hiervoor software die de divisie Statistiek in staat stelt om statistiekproducten te ontwikkelen voor interne en externe afnemers.


#### **Zo doe je dat als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Als Azure Data Engineer ga je aan de slag met oplossingen in o.a. Azure Synapse, PySpark (voor data-integratie en ETL-proces), Azure SQL (databases) en Azure DevOps (CI/CD), maar er zal ook nagedacht moeten worden over interfaces met onze gebruikers om data te kunnen inzien, analyseren, corrigeren of te verzenden. Je draagt bij aan de kwaliteit van de oplossingen en stemt deze af met andere specialisten. Ook geef je advies over de technische inrichting van de Microsoft Azure-omgeving alsook de hands-on implementatie.


Wat ga je precies doen?


* Je bouwt en onderhoudt oplossingen in Microsoft Azure om data-oplossingen voor Statistiek snel, flexibel en robuust te maken en te houden.
* Je bouwt en onderhoudt logische en technische datamodellen, ETL-programmatuur en business logica in een DevOps-context.
* Je blijft op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen binnen je vakgebied en neemt initiatief om dit op relevante momenten naar voren te brengen dan wel toe te passen.

#### **Een dag als Azure Data Engineer bij DNB**


Je start je dag met de stand-up. In de Data-community later die ochtend bespreek je met collega’s de meet-up over de nieuwe functionaliteit die jullie binnenkort implementeren. Na de lunch met je collega’s, werk je aan de backlog items van de huidige sprint, waarbij je voor complexere oplossingen veel met je collega’s spart. Later die middag heb je een refinement-sessie met je team en de product owner. Na de refinement is er duidelijkheid, zijn de prioriteiten helder en is er een juiste inschatting van de backlog items gemaakt. De dag is omgevlogen en met een tevreden gevoel ga je naar huis.


Hier doe je dat


Je werkt als Azure Data Engineer in Amsterdam bij de divisie Data- & Informatie-Technologie (DIT), voor de afdeling Monetair & Statistiek (MS). Het is een omgeving waar processen enerzijds vragen om grote veiligheid en stabiliteit en anderzijds om innovatie. Denk hierbij aan de ontvangst van rapportages van financiële instellingen tot en met de ontsluiting van de gegevens naar partijen als de ECB en het CBS.


Als Azure Data Engineer werk je nauw samen met enthousiaste collega’s uit verschillende vakgebieden in een DevOps context (o.a. solution architectuur, beleidsmedewerkers en data scientists). Er zijn meerdere Agile teams actief. De teams zijn trots op de producten die zij leveren. Als Azure Data Engineer ga je werken in één van deze teams en ben je samen met je collega’s verantwoordelijk voor nieuwe functionaliteit en het beheer van de geleverde oplossingen.


DNB heeft de wettelijke taak statistieken te publiceren over Nederland en de financiële sector. Hierin wordt onder andere intensief samengewerkt met het CBS. Een aantal voorbeelden vind je op **Statistieken (dnb.nl)**.  

  

Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.


Dit breng je mee


Je bent een senior data engineer en een enthousiast persoon met een proactieve instelling. We vinden het belangrijk dat jij gaat voor de hoogste kwaliteit en het beste resultaat. Daarnaast ben je multi-inzetbaar, werk je graag samen in een team en hebben collega’s het gevoel dat ze op je kunnen bouwen. Je vindt het belangrijk jezelf te blijven ontwikkelen: vakinhoudelijk, maar ook als mens. Je beheerst de Nederlandse taal uitstekend, zowel mondeling als schriftelijk.  

  

Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?  

  

Naast een afgeronde Bachelor of Master en enkele jaren werkervaring zijn dit de specifieke skills die we zoeken:


* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met Python en PySpark.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met een Spark-omgeving als Azure Data Factory en/of Synapse.
* Aantoonbare ervaring (min 3 jaar) met SQL DB en T-SQL.

**Opdracht omschrijving:**

FLUX is hét model voor de gerealiseerde reizigersaantallen bij NS. Deze gegevens zijn cruciaal voor diverse bedrijfsprocessen, zoals het verantwoorden van de prestaties aan het ministerie, inzicht geven in de drukte in de treinen en op stations, tot aan de ontwikkeling van reizigersprognoses voor het materieelplan. Zodoende heb je directe impact in het beschikbaar maken van inzichten over onze reizigers.

* Je haalt plezier uit analyseren van technische problemen en het optimaliseren van het (operations-) proces om zo het gebruik van de data voor de afnemers zo soepel mogelijk te maken
* Je werkt graag in een agile team met andere data engineers en data scientists
* Het geeft je energie om continu te innoveren en tegelijkertijd stabiele en betrouwbare resultaten te leveren

**Dit ga je doen**  
Onze missie bij de NS is om Nederland duurzaam bereikbaar te houden, voor iedereen. Inzichten in de reizigersstromen zijn hierbij onmisbaar voor een optimale dienstverlening. Met behulp van geavanceerde modellen bepalen we hoeveel reizigers tussen stations hebben gereisd en met welke treinen ze dat hebben gedaan, ook als ze een keer vergeten zijn om uit te checken.

Team FLUX werkt aan het model dat onze reizigers achteraf toedeelt aan gereden treinen. FLUX is een belangrijke bron voor een diverse groep afnemers binnen NS. Het is van groot belang dat we deze gegevens tijdig, volledig en accuraat aanleveren.

Wij zijn op zoek naar een teamlid met een achtergrond in Data Engineering of MLOps Engineering om ons te helpen FLUX verder te verbeteren.

Om de kwaliteit van het FLUX-model zo hoog mogelijk te houden, werken we continu aan innovaties op het model en de processen. Op korte termijn willen we onze operationele workflows verbeteren om issues snel te identificeren en op te lossen.

Daarnaast liggen er plannen klaar om de kwaliteit van FLUX verder te verhogen, nieuwe bronnen te verwerken, FLUX te versnellen en onze infrastructuur te professionaliseren. Kortom, genoeg uitdagend werk te doen!

**Hier ga je werken**

Op loopafstand van station Utrecht Centraal bundelen zo´n 200 collega´s van de afdeling Data, Innovatie & Analyse (DIA) hun krachten. Hier werkt een mix van ervaringen en persoonlijkheden, die elkaar graag opzoeken om met elkaar te sparren en kennis te delen. De afdeling geeft (interne) gebruikers snel en betrouwbaar inzicht om tot juiste acties te komen door het verzamelen, combineren, analyseren en presenteren van informatie. Als ontwikkelaar in FLUX ben je onderdeel van het Advanced Analytics team, maar overleg je ook veel met collega’s uit andere vakgebieden. Met jou bestaat het team FLUX uit negen personen, inclusief de product owner en scrum master.  
Vanuit DIA werken we samen met collega’s uit IT en de business in multidisciplinaire clusters. Team FLUX valt binnen het cluster Reizigersstromen. Dit cluster bestaat uit ongeveer 30 collega's die gezamenlijk verantwoordelijk zijn voor het leveren en verbeteren van data, inzichten en advies over reizigersstromen, zowel gerealiseerd als prognoses voor de toekomst.

Daarnaast maakt FLUX deel uit van het DIA Advanced Analytics (AA) gilde bij NS, waar teams in zitten die zich bezighouden met het oplossen van complexe (business)vraagstukken met behulp van Machine Learning en AI. Op deze onderwerpen leren we als teams weer van elkaar

Maar dat is zeker niet het enige. De Rabobank is een coöperatieve bank met een missie. Samen met klanten, leden en partners zet de Rabobank zich in voor een sterkere leefomgeving en voor de grote maatschappelijke uitdagingen van nu, met als uitgangspunt dat er samen meer bereikt wordt dan alleen. Die missie kan alleen waargemaakt worden doordat Rabobank een krachtige bank is die efficiënt werkt.


Daarnaast is Rabobank actief betrokken bij veel maatschappelijke initiatieven. Een deel van de winst wordt geïnvesteerd in de samenleving. Verder weg, door te zorgen dat boeren een eerlijke prijs krijgen voor hun producten. En dichtbij, door in heel Nederland samen buurten beter te maken. Zo’n 1250 organisaties in sport en cultuur die voor veel mensen een tweede thuis zijn worden ondersteund. Een ander voorbeeld is het project met Humanitas, waarin mensen worden geholpen die financiële problemen hebben hun thuisadministratie op orde te krijgen. Een derde voorbeeld is dat samen met Vluchtelingenwerk Nederland 1.500 vluchtelingen worden geholpen bij het vinden van een goed passende baan.


Om haar kerntaak blijvend te realiseren heeft Rabobank een ambitieus plan opgesteld waarin het creëren van een optimale Engineering Journey een belangrijke pijler is.

Of hou je ervan evenementen te organiseren of wil je collega’s begeleiden? Er zijn veel interne initiatieven waaraan jij kunt deelnemen waardoor jij, maar ook de organisatie, verder kan ontwikkelen.


**Wat ga je doen?**


* Actief samenwerken en communiceren met interne en externe stakeholders. De ideeën en behoeftes van de klant omzetten naar functionele en/of technische requirements, maar ook schakelen met project management en product owners.
* Analyseren en evalueren van huidige BI oplossingen, met als doel deze oplossing uiteindelijk te kunnen migreren en/of optimaliseren.. of weg te gooien.
* Testen, implementeren en adopteren van BI oplossingen die zijn ontwikkeld door het data team.


**Wat zijn jouw vaardigheden?**


* In deze rol zijn we op zoek naar proactieve collega’s die gemotiveerd zijn met het werken met de nieuwste Microsoft technologie.
* Als consultant is het belangrijk om zowel de taal van de business als IT te spreken. Daarom waarderen we mensen met sterke communicatieve vaardigheden die complexe onderwerpen in simpele taal kunnen uitleggen.
* Het is belangrijk dat je georganiseerd en gestructureerd kunt werken, een backlog met structuur werkt namelijk een stuk makkelijker dan eentje zonder.


**Wat is jouw profiel?**


* Je spreekt Nederlands, maar kunt ook in het Engels uit de voeten. Een goede beheersing van de Duitse taal is een grote plus. (We zijn een internationaal team, maar momenteel alleen op zoek naar Nederlandstalige collega’s. Voor niet-Nederlandstaligen zullen er ook later weer vacatures online komen.)
* Je hebt al enige ervaring in het vakgebied of gerelateerd vakgebied, met 3-5 jaar werkervaring als analist, consultant of ontwikkelaar in het data domein.
* Je hebt een kwantitatieve achtergrond: ICT, Informatica, Computer of Data Science is top, maar we zoeken ook mensen die een zakelijke achtergrond hebben en later overgestapt zijn naar IT.
* Je weet hoe je de vragen van klant kan omschrijven naar user stories op de backlog.
* Je hebt ervaring met een (of beide) van de volgende vakgebieden:
* **Power BI / Fabric:** Concepten zoals ster schema’s, dataflows, RLS en OLS en talen zoals DAX en M zijn niet onbekend voor jou. Met de komst van Fabric heb je je ook verdiept in concepten zoals pipelines, warehouses, lakehouses en notebooks. Een PL-300 of DP-600 certificaat wordt daarom gewaardeerd!


**En/of**


* **Data engineering:** Je bent bekend met technologieën zoals Synapse, Databricks, Azure Data Factory. Concepten zoals medallion architecture en ETL/ELT zijn jou niet onbekend. Ook heb je enige kennis van talen zoals T-SQL, Python en PySpark.
* Ervaring met Agile/Scrum en kennis van DevOps of JIRA is een pré.
* Domeinkennis (bijvoorbeeld op het gebied van financiën, onderwijs of marketing) is welkom! We proberen de domeinkennis van onze collega’s goed te gebruiken wanneer we een klant in een bepaalde industrie ondersteunen.


**Wat kan je van Macaw verwachten?**


* ***Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down*** **–** We hebben een geweldig team met veel ervaren, gedreven collega’s die je zullen helpen als iets buiten je comfortzone is.
* Een goed salaris, mobiliteitsbudget, een telefoon met abonnement en een laptop
* Een thuiswerkbudget voor een thuiswerkplek en internet
* Een studiebudget voor trainingen
* 29 vakantiedagen (dat kan oplopen tot 33 dagen wanneer we onze doelen halen)
* Flexibele werktijden (32- 40 uur). De meeste collega’s werken een aantal dagen thuis, aantal dagen op het hoofdkantoor en een aantal dagen bij de klant.
* Een open kantoor met leuke extra’s zoals een pooltafel, pingpongtafel (doe je mee aan de competitie?) en Xbox.

As a data platform engineer, you will be working on our data platform named Thor. With Thor, we want to create a self-service, metadata driven data platform where data producers can share their data with the data consumers without the platform team being the bottleneck. This means that we are working hard to enable our users so they can do as much as possible themselves and we can focus on improving and optimizing our pipelines and codebase.

 **A few cool new features we have recently implemented:**

* Smart Scheduling that dynamically changes data pipeline configuration based on historical statistics
* A versioned data platform that allows the product to scale to other brands
* Documentation that writes itself


If you want to know more about how it is to work in this team, read: https://werk.ah.nl/colleagues/charlotte-van-der-scheun/

* You optimize performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency of data pipelines and analytics workloads on Databricks
* You enable data producers with self-service capabilities on our data platform granting them the freedom to autonomously share their data to the rest of the organization for data driven insights
* You stay informed latest developments on technologies and industry trends, and evaluate their potential impact on our data platform strategy

 **Your new team and office.**

Our teams work in a hybrid way: both from home as well as in the office. We are located right next to the train station of Zaandam.

For this job we are preferably looking for someone who brings diversity to our team, in the widest possible sense. Someone who is a great addition to our team by bringing other ideas to the table. Don’t check all the boxes? Don’t worry, we probably don’t either . Don’t hesitate to apply if you think you are up for the challenge, we’re happy to have a look at your resume!

* An annual salary up to 95k including holiday allowance and a flexible bonus. Depending on your level of seniority and experience

* Flexible working hours

* An excellent pension plan where we as an employer contribute 6 times more than you as an employee

Albert Heijn goes way back. More than 135 years, to be exact. So for millions of people, food shopping is synonymous with the Albert Heijn brand.

More than 125,000 colleagues? Check. Over 1,250 stores in the Netherlands and Flanders? Check. The leading online food retail platform? Check, we build, run and love it.

Integreren en realiseren van koppelingen met meer traditionele dataleveranciers en afnemers. Dit kunnen services zijn, streaming data, maar in enkele gevallen misschien ook nog wel een legacy systeem met een batch koppeling met CSV-bestanden. Concreet: integreren van systemen tot een totaaloplossing.


Migreren van bestaande data-oplossingen naar de nieuwe Azure-oplossingen. Concreet: realiseren van betrouwbare migratiepatronen om (veelal) een geleidelijke migratie mogelijk te maken.

The role
Join our dynamic bioinformatics team at Genmab as a student data engineer, where you will play a crucial role in supporting our scientists by creating and managing sophisticated data architectures aligned with FAIR principles. In this position, you will focus on integrating real-world clinical and molecular data into graph database models to facilitate complex data analysis and enable innovative research methodologies.

Your work will support essential projects aimed at enhancing drug discovery and development processes, fostering your growth as a data scientist and making a meaningful impact in the field of biomedicine.*Project Background*
Translational research leverages real-world data sets to study how patients respond to cancer treatments. This research often involves integrating complex and non-standardized molecular and clinical data. Clinical datasets, designed to answer specific scientific questions, typically lack detailed data granularity, making exploration challenging. Understanding the clinical data model is crucial to selecting the appropriate variables for analysis.
This project proposes the use of graph databases to overcome these challenges by organizing data into a flexible, multidimensional structure that facilitates easier access and more intuitive querying. Graph databases, such as Neo4j or Amazon Neptune, allow for the discovery of implicit relationships within the data that traditional table-based databases might miss. Through this initiative, we aim to develop and evaluate AI-driven querying techniques using natural language, enhancing the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets in translational research.
Responsibilities* Technology Exploration: Investigate various graph database technologies and their applicability to managing clinical data, assessing their strengths and limitations in this domain.
* Data Model Comparison: Compare and analyze the data structures of graph and relational databases to identify the most effective frameworks for clinical data.
* Pilot Database Development: Design and implement a prototype database focused on the standardization of clinical real-world data, ensuring it supports robust data integration and access.
* Natural Language Query Development: Create methods to enable querying of graph databases using natural language, employing advanced AI technologies to facilitate intuitive data interactions.
* Findings Presentation: Regularly present progress and insights during team meetings, ensuring clear communication of developments and challenges.
* Bonus Objective: Develop a user interface that enables easy querying, and effective visualization and presentation of results from the database.


Requirements* Education: You are a BSc/MSc student in bioinformatics, computational biology or a related field.
* Technical skills: Demonstrated strong technical skills, with substantial experience in Python programming. Familiarity with AWS is an added advantage.
* Soft skills: Comfortable with pioneering research and creative processes; scientific thinking and connecting that to technical requirements.


About You* You are passionate about our purpose and genuinely care about our mission to transform the lives of patients through innovative cancer treatment
* You bring rigor and excellence to all that you do. You are a fierce believer in our rooted-in-science approach to problem-solving
* You are a generous collaborator who can work in teams with diverse backgrounds
* You are determined to do and be your best and take pride in enabling the best work of others on the team
* You are not afraid to grapple with the unknown and be innovative

**Postdoc on the subject of Trustworthy Human-AI Interaction for Media and Democracy (m/f/x)**


We are looking for a talented postdoc who is interested in trustworthy and transparent human-AI interactions, in the context of news media and journalism.


A 2-year fixed-term full time Postdoc position is available at the Distributed & Interactive Systems (DIS) research group at CWI. This project is a collaboration between CWI and the AI, Media, and Democracy (AIMD) lab in Amsterdam. You will be working under the supervision of Dr. Abdallah El Ali and Prof.dr. Pablo Cesar, where you will be embedded within the AIMD lab.


**Job description**
-------------------


The AI, Media and Democracy (AIMD) ELSA Lab’s aim is to set up an experimental space and testbed for novel ways of applying AI in the media. Journalists, media professionals, designers, citizens, researchers and public and societal partners bring in their challenges in using AI in the media. The lab investigates how AI-driven applications in the media change the public sphere, civic engagement and economic competition, and explores novel ways of applying AI in the media. The Distributed & Interactive Systems (DIS) research group at CWI combines data science with a strong human-centric, empirical approach to understand the experience of users. This enables us to design and develop next generation intelligent and empathic systems. We base our results on realistic testing grounds and data sets, and embrace areas such as ubiquitous and affective computing, human-centered multimedia systems, and human-AI interaction.


Encounters with AI-generated content can impact the human experience of algorithms, and more broadly the psychology of Human–AI interaction. In particular, AI system disclosures can influence users’ perceptions of media content. There is a growing concern that as generative AI becomes more widely used, manipulated content could easily spread false information. As a key step toward mitigating harms and risk, a key recent mitigation effort involves the European Al Act Proposition “Transparency Obligations for Providers and Users of Certain AI Systems and GPAI Models”, which seeks to address the issue of AI system transparency.


The research scope broadly addresses the effective, trustworthy, and transparent communication of AI system disclosures. We aim to account for ethical and legal considerations, design and human factors perspectives, as well as policy recommendations. As such, this role may involve relevant stakeholders where necessary, ranging from media organizations, policy makers, as well as AI researchers and practitioners. The initial focus is on the end-user (media consumer) perspective, and at later stages, on the perspective of the media organizations and the generative AI media production process itself. For this postdoc, we are specifically interested in how trust in AI systems can be garnered by focusing on creating better user interfaces and/or understanding human-AI system interactions at a cognitive, behavioral, and physiological level. By establishing user-centric designs for transparent AI disclosures, we can take steps toward ensuring a well-functioning democratic society.


We expect the postdoc researcher to be embedded within the AI, Media, and Democracy lab, which is located in Amsterdam’s city center.


**Topics of interest include:**


* Intelligent visualization techniques, adaptive user interfaces (UI), and content personalization, that allows tailoring users’ experience of the UI and media content as well as any associated disclosures and/or explanations
* User behavioral and physiological sensing techniques for human-AI interaction, that can help predict the right balance between information overload and the essential information to be communicated to users to build user trust in systems employing generative AI
* Developing and evaluating novel user interfaces for journalism that incorporate meaningful disclosure mechanisms for generative AI, from news production to audience engagement, to ensure user agency and autonomy
* Designing and evaluating explainability interfaces for journalists and editors working with AI to ensure responsible decision making
* Empirical studies (online and/or lab-based) to understand the relationship between AI disclosures and how people perceived AI content, for both users and media organization

**Requirements**
----------------


Depending on the specific topic of interest, candidates are required to have completed their PhD in computer science, human-computer interaction, industrial design, cognitive science, or a related field. We specifically seek candidates with a strong interest in physiological sensing and signal processing, information visualization, and/or human-centered AI. Ideally, the candidate has worked already on topics related to the social, ethical, or information presentation aspects of AI in the media sector. Candidates are expected to have publications in top HCI venues such as CHI, CSCW, UbiComp / ISWC, IEEE Vis, FAccT, IUI, or related venues.


Needed qualifications for candidates include proven research talent, strong technical background, and good academic writing and presentation skills. Candidates are expected to have an excellent command of English.

**That’s why we love them!**

  


Orbisk employees **do** talk trash a lot. To be more precise, they discuss reducing food waste in the hospitality industry. How does the Orbi work in practice? Waiters scan cleared plates at Orbisk hardware stations, and our algorithms throw themselves on the leftovers to determine when ingredients were thrown away and in what quantity. Food for (actionable) thought because if we – for example – discover that guests aren’t into tomatoes but devour every last spec of avocado, restaurateurs can source smarter, reducing food waste and costs. We’ve already helped eliminate a whopping 737.520 kg of food waste, and we’re just getting started!

  

**As our Data Analyst,** you'll step into the role of our groundbreaking 'data detective' - the nickname we made up for the analyst who transforms complex data into clear, actionable insights for our product. Partnering with our Data & AI team, you will be responsible for transforming complex data sets into user-friendly insights that drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.


Additionally, we invite you to use your expertise to improve our data usability and enhance overall data quality. We want Orbisk to become a well-known name in the global hospitality business, and we believe you can help us achieve that goal.

  

**Our Product: The Orbisk Dashboard**  

Our product is a data-rich dashboard that shows all the waste registered by one or multiple of our Orbi’s. We can slice and dice this data in many different ways. As you can imagine, one Orbi registering waste is quite straightforward, but as we grow we now face the challenge of customers with increasingly complex environments, like waste from more than 200 different Orbis in different locations, time-zones, currencies and other (cultural) differences.



In this role, you'll become an expert in the data collected by the Orbi food waste monitor. You will frequently participate in food waste coaching sessions with our customers, assisting the Orbisk coaches in understanding customer data to maximize the value we can extract for them. Besides addressing hands-on data requests, you will also be responsible for systematically identifying common patterns in how customers successfully utilize the provided data. You will then translate these insights into new features that enhance our product's effectiveness. Do you feel like you are ready to bite down into this great international data challenge?

  

**The role in 6 bullets**

  

* Analyze data from multiple Orbi's to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for waste reduction.
* Develop and maintain intuitive, data-rich dashboards that provide clear insights into food waste metrics.
* Work closely with our product owner, developers, and other stakeholders to implement data-driven solutions.
* Continuously seek ways to improve data collection, analysis processes, and reporting accuracy.
* Conduct user research to understand the needs and behaviors of our clients, ensuring our data solutions are aligned with their goals.
* Propose and implement innovative data analysis methodologies and tools to enhance our service offerings.

 **Your track record mentions**

  

* You've been in the data game for 3+ years.
* Masters or bachelors degree in a technical field, such as data science or computer science.
* The magic, or ability to convert questions or requirements into comprehensive data reports, dashboards, or other data solutions.
* Thorough and meticulous approach to understanding data nuances, complexities, and the necessity for accurate reporting.
* You're a ""masterchef"" when it comes to data analysis frameworks and tools such as SQL, Python, dashboarding solutions, and data visualization.
* Big plus: experience with data-heavy products, where extracting value from data requires innovation beyond standard reporting and dashboarding.

  


**Why join Orbisk?**



For a whole menu of reasons. Some lofty (reducing food waste also reduces our collective CO2 and H2O footprints), others more down-to-earth. After all, joining a scale-up that disrupts an entire industry is also just plain fun. And a great conversation starter. Especially if that team is as driven and adventurous as ours. We also offer you:

  

* €4.500 - €6.000 gross p/m (depending on knowledge and experience)
* Pension scheme and 30 paid vacation days (based on 40 hours per week)
* Company laptop and €250 netto home office budget per year
* Education & Alleo budget, and a travel allowance
* Free office lunch and an office dog to keep you company
* An office based in Utrecht and option to work partly remote
* A young and creative startup work environment that invests in your development
* A close-knit team with smart, enthusiastic colleagues who are happy to share their expertise with you. And on Fridays, a (non-alcoholic?) beer or two.

Samen met de 14 gemeenten en onze ketenpartners zetten we ons in voor een gezond, veilig en vitaal Twente.

**Wat ga je doen**

Als privacy officer kom je te werken in een unieke organisatie. Wij staan midden in de maatschappij en verwerken veel gevoelige persoonsgegevens.

Ons organisatieonderdeel GGD Twente speelt een centrale rol bij onder andere de bestrijding van infectieziekten zoals Corona en TBC, de gezondheid van opgroeiende kinderen en grootschalig dataonderzoek onder Twentse inwoners.

We zijn begonnen aan een ontdekkingsreis rondom privacy. Jij staat daarbij aan het roer en kan meebepalen. De ontwikkeling en de doorontwikkeling staan bij ons hoog in het vaandel en daarop gaan we de komende tijd inzetten. Dat maakt dat we zoekende zijn hóe we de ontwikkelingen aanvliegen. Wil jij met ons meedenken?

*Niet alles is dus geregeld. Zie jij daar kansen en mogelijkheden?*

Jij zorgt er voor dat het verwerkingenregister op orde is, dat data protection impact assessments (DPIA’s) worden uitgevoerd voor nieuwe en bestaande systemen en processen, waarbij mogelijk sprake is van verhoogde privacy risico’s.

Je kan niet-juristen helder uitleggen welke keuzes en dilemma’s er zijn als het gaat om privacy in relatie tot de beoogde doelen van de organisatie.

Met jouw gestructureerde en zorgvuldige aanpak weet jij de nodige resultaten te behalen. Je volgt de ontwikkelingen op het gebied van privacy op de voet en adviseert collega’s, teammanagers en opdrachtgevers gevraagd en ongevraagd over dit onderwerp.

**Opleiding en ervaring van onze ideale kandidaat**

Dat doen we o.a. door het organiseren van vakwedstrijden. Jongeren laten ontdekken waar hun passie ligt, hun skills te vergroten, de kans geven om met vakmanschap te schitteren; daar zetten we ons elke dag met veel plezier voor in! We werken hiervoor veel samen met scholen en bedrijven.

Voor het team Marketing & Communicatie zijn we op zoek naar een enthousiaste en ervaren manager. Je hebt een brede ervaring op gebied van o.a. branding, projectmanagement en online marketing. Van nature beschik je over een coachende stijl van leidinggeven en maak je makkelijk contact met anderen.

Kom ons team versterken en laten we samen de wereld van skills en vakmanschap in de spotlight zetten!

**Wat ga je doen als Marketing & Communicatie Manager**

Je zet je in om vmbo-leerlingen en mbo-studenten een platform te geven zich te ontwikkelen, te groeien en trots te laten zijn op hun vak. De werkzaamheden zijn zeer divers en lopen uiteen van projectplannen ontwikkelen om zoveel mogelijk bezoekers te werven voor Skills The Finals, tot aan de uitwerking van campagnes en communicatiemiddelen waardoor jongeren geïnspireerd worden beroepen te ontdekken bij het studiekeuze programma. Je bent veelzijdig inzetbaar en weet snel te schakelen tussen strategisch, tactisch en operationeel niveau.

Het team bestaat uit vier vaste medewerkers. De organisatie kent een hoge mate van ambitie. Aan jou is het de taak om de beste match te vinden tussen individuele- en organisatie ambitie. Binnen de organisatie past een coachende stijl van leidinggeven. Naast het vaste team werk je samen met verschillende freelancers en externe bureaus.

Als Marketing & Communicatiemanager zorg je intern voor verbinding tussen projectmanagers, algemeen management en het marketing & communicatie team. Voor verschillende events sluit je aan in werkgroepen. Daarnaast ben je verantwoordelijk voor contact met pers en media. Het is van belang dat je makkelijk contact maakt, verbindingen legt en altijd je best doet tot de kern te komen bij vraagstukken. Naast beschikken over een vlotte babbel kun je dus ook goed luisteren.
