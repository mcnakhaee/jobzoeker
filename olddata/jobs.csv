Are you ready to join our team and together improve our understanding of terrestrial ecosystem carbon uptake on Earth?



The Earth has become greener as a result of increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, and the carbon uptake by the vegetation has also increased. Will that process continue, how does vegetation adapt to climate, and what is the role of disturbances such as fires, floods and droughts? And how can we best use satellite data in combination with Earth system models? In the CONCERTO project we work with scientists from institutes in Europe to answer these questions. The University of Twente focuses on the use and interpretation of satellite data, with emphasis on the upcoming FLEX satellite mission.



As researcher in our team, you will have three main tasks in this project, each in collaboration with other institutes. The first is to help improve long\-term global land cover maps with satellite data. The second one is to support Earth system modellers with tools to use satellite data of solar induced fluorescence (SIF) and other satellite data, by using and improving radiative transfer models. The third task is to develop theoretical knowledge about the response of photosynthesis to weather, climate and disturbances, using satellite data, the p\-model developed at the Imperial College London and the model SCOPE developed at the University of Twente.



In short, this position provides an outstanding chance to work with satellite data and collaborate with European research scientists who work on quantifying ecosystem dynamics and climate projections.


### **Your profile**

* A PhD in Remote Sensing, Earth and/or Environmental Science, Physical Geography, global Ecology, or a related relevant field
* Experience with remote sensing satellite data
* Programming skills such as Python, Matlab, Octive, R, or Julia
* Good communication skills and proficiency in English
* Good problem\-solving skills, as well as organisational and teamwork skills
* Living in/willingness to move to the Netherlands
### **Our offer**

* An inspiring multidisciplinary, international and academic environment. The university offers a dynamic ecosystem with enthusiastic colleagues in which internationalization is an important part of the strategic agenda
* A full\-time position until 1 March 2028 (for 30 months)
* Gross monthly salary between € 3,897\.\- and € 5,331\.\- per month depending on experience and qualifications (UFO profile Researcher 4\)
* A holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year\-end bonus of 8\.3%
* Excellent support for research and facilities for professional and personal development
* A solid pension scheme
* A total of 41 holiday days per year in case of full\-time employment
* Excellent working conditions, an exciting scientific environment, and a lively green campus

### **Information and application**



For more information about the position, please get in touch with Christiaan van der To (email: c.vandertol@utwente.nl). You are also invited to visit our homepage.



Please submit your application **before 1 May 2024\.** Your application should include:

* **Leverage advanced analytics** 
 – Using techniques like regression analysis, causal inference, and A/B testing, you’ll analyze user behavior, identify actionable insights, and evaluate the effectiveness of new features to ensure continuous improvement.
  
* **Enable data\-driven decision\-making at scale** 
 – You’ll identify and implement self\-service data solutions that empower Product teams to make informed decisions faster. Beyond Product analytics, you’ll contribute to foundational data projects like building scalable data pipelines, improving data accessibility, and expanding our A/B Experimentation program.
  


  

**Who You Are** 
  

  
* **Experienced data professional** 
 – You have a strong quantitative background and 3\+ years of experience in data science or analytics, ideally in an online company.
  
* **Technical skills** 
 – You're proficient in SQL and comfortable writing code to transform data into insights, whether in Python, R, or another language. You can handle large datasets, manage complex data pipelines, and work with tools like Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI, and data transformation tools like dbt or Dataform.
  
* **Statistical expertise** 
 – You have a solid understanding of statistics and can apply techniques like regression analysis, causal inference, and hypothesis testing to extract meaningful insights from data.
  
* **Web and app analytics** 
 – You have experience with tracking tools like Google Analytics (GA) and Google Tag Manager (GTM), helping to measure and optimize user behavior.
  
* **Data\-driven experimentation** 
 – You understand A/B testing principles and how to apply them to drive meaningful insights.
  
* **Turning data into action** 
 – You don’t just analyze data—you extract insights that drive business decisions, even with minimal engineering support.
  
* **Strong communicator** 
 – You work effectively with business owners, engineers, and leadership, translating data insights into clear recommendations.

Team Overview
  
The vacancy is in the TRM/Centralization, Valuation \& Product Control team which, amongst others, is the centre of expertise for valuation and product control topics within the bank. It is an international team with an informal and open atmosphere, with team members working across Amsterdam and London, all working together with a strong delivery focus. The team is responsible for setting/designing the valuation framework and implementation in terms of fair and prudent valuation. The team is currently being extended with the intention to deliver the ‘Valuation Program’. After (or in parallel to) the delivery of the program, the team will become responsible for the BAU management of the newly designed processes/activities.
  
  

Roles and responsibilities
  
The role is focused on delivering valuation regulatory and accounting requirements across different regional hubs. You will be involved in a variety of topics related to valuation risks (mostly for trading but also for banking books) to deliver the ‘Valuation Program’, which aims to address new regulatory requirements and higher model risk management expectations in this area. The key focus over the next few years will be on valuation (re)developments, where you will play a key role in the design, development, implementation, testing and roll out to production of IFRS and Prudent Valuation (AVA) related enhancements across several asset classes.
  
  

As part of the ‘Valuation Program’, you will be critical supporting the team to ensure the successful and timely delivery of one or multiple workstreams in the project , which will be aligned to committed regulatory \& internal deadlines. A high\-level overview of these workstreams is presented below:
  
  

Designing, implementing, and maintaining a compliant fair and prudent valuation framework and governance for all Fair Value books.
  
  

Designing and implementing the framework to assess the observability, accuracy and uncertainty of market data used as input in valuation activities, as well as monitoring and analysing the results from these assessments and propose different market data sources when required.
  
  

Development, implementation and roll\-out of IPV \& Valuation Adjustment models (such as market price uncertainty, close\-out costs, concentrated positions, future administrative costs, etc), as well as ensuring appropriate model risk management for these models, in line with internal and regulatory requirements.
  
  

Development, implementation and roll\-out of other fair valuation related activities, such as Fair Value Hierarchy, Day One P\&L or new product initiatives where valuation modelling requirements/implications should be addressed and followed up.
  
  

How to succeed
  
We hire smart people like you for your potential. Our biggest expectation is that you’ll stay curious. Keep learning. Take on responsibility. In return, we’ll back you to develop into an even more awesome version of yourself.
  
To succeed in the delivery of these workstreams, you will need:
  
  

Flexibility in the way and scope of working, as all workstreams in the Valuation Program are strongly interrelated and scope prioritizations might change based on delivery deadlines and other dependencies.
  
  

Build relationships and work together with multiple stakeholders such as Front Office, Finance, Risk, Product Controllers, IT, Development \& Validation Quants and market data providers for successful delivery and implementation of re\-developed processes/models, ensuring that newly designed methodologies and models are appropriate and their impacts are well understood and agreed.
  
  

Engagement/follow up with regulators, auditors and the industry on valuation related items.
  
  

Ability to work with large data sets and systems, in an environment where data \& processes are largely fragmented and manually managed.
  
  

Ensure operational excellence of valuation processes, maximising automation possibilities to provide a robust and compliant operational valuation framework, including delivering IT specifications to implement strategic solutions.

Why choose Eneco?
The energy transition is in full swing and Eneco is leading the way. Our goal? To be fully climate\-neutral by 2035\. This applies to our own business activities, but also to the energy we supply to our customers. For example, we develop wind and solar farms ourselves, and we help customers take sustainable steps every day with smart products and good advice. Now that we are part of Mitsubishi Corporation, our impact has increased, and we are accelerating the transition. We need your expertise to drive this change. As a **Forecast** **Analyst**, you’ll play a key role in supporting Eneco's trading activities through cutting\-edge analysis and modelling

Later, if you are not part of the operations anymore, you will be on standby (during working hours) for issues that our operations team is unable to resolve independently. As a result, this role offers a well\-balanced mix of hands\-on work and coding. This empowers you to be creative, come up with improvements, and use your development skills for quick and tangible improvements, visible in a quick feedback loop.

* Relevant technologies include: Git, Databricks, Airflow, Snowflake, Docker, Azure Cloud

* Knowledge and experience of energy markets is a plus

You’ll be responsible for
Tasks:

* Collaborate with our Forecast Product Development team to develop, improve and validate forecasting models for wind/solar production and power/gas/heat consumption

* Validating and analyzing data (e.g., identifying irregularities and outliers in forecasting model outputs)
* Support Daily Business Analysts colleagues in operations

This is where you’ll work
At Eneco Energy Trade, some 150 colleagues work at the heart of the organization. This is where the supply and demand of energy converge. Where we bundle our own and external energy flows and ensure that there is enough energy to meet demand. The international team consists of several divisions: Sourcing \& Pricing, Trading, Portfolio Optimization, Structuring \& Organization, Business Development, Energy Operations \& IT Management.

**About your future job**


When developing advanced radar systems, Thales aims to minimize maintenance needs, ensure maintenance is simple and preferably predictable, and enable remote assistance if necessary. To achieve this, the Maintenance Intel team provides diagnostics, both through automated diagnostics embedded in products and via (remote) analysis of logged product data.


As a **Diagnostics Developer**, you will be responsible for developing automatic diagnostic functions for one or more radar products or components. During the design phase of a radar product, you will begin by writing specifications. The development teams will use these specifications to ensure your requirements are considered in the hardware and software development. This results in a complex product composed of dozens to hundreds of replaceable hardware components for transmission and reception functionality, digital processing, optics, servos, power distribution, and climate control—all incorporating your requirements.


You will regularly collaborate with electrical, mechanical, and software designers to identify potential failures, analyze their manifestations, and suggest improvements. You will dive into the design details and gain an in\-depth understanding of the system. Using this knowledge, you will create a model of hardware failure behavior and interactions—a complex model that predicts how a defect propagates and manifests as a pattern of software alarms and other indicators. With our tools, you will convert this model into software embedded in the product, allowing end users to receive system health information. During the step\-by\-step product integration, you will validate and refine this model in collaboration with the integration team. Your responsibility is to ensure that the product can ultimately diagnose itself accurately.


Once the system is in use by customers, you will assist service engineers with diagnosing difficult\-to\-troubleshoot problems. As a **digital detective**, you will use analysis tools to interpret logged product data, identifying and explaining abnormal product behavior. Based on your findings, you will provide feedback to service engineers and contribute to developing algorithms that will allow our data platform to automatically generate insights and recommendations in the future.

**Main tasks**

* Assessing the **self\-testability** of an electrical, mechanical, optical, or software design and suggesting improvements to enhance testability
* Developing a **diagnostic model** for a product or product components

**WHAT YOU’LL DO:**


**Here’s what you can expect on a typical day in the life of an Associate Software Engineer at ADP.**

* We’ll start each day with a scrum, working together to understand responsibilities, ID any issues, and communicate coding priorities.

* Working in two\-week sprints, you must keep up with timelines and coding standards, which will already be documented and brought to your attention.
* **Variety of work.** There is no typical day. You could work on anything from migrations to delivering new features, product enhancements, or creating new services.

* We’re working on products with tech that we’ve never used before. Inevitable challenges will arise, and we’ll rely on you to look for a solution.
* You’ll work in a continuous development environment using Git/Bitbucket and automatic build and testing.

Any exposure to any of these technologies would be desirable: Spring Boot, Docker Containers, Object Oriented programming **to develop on Backend**

* **Give back to others.** You want to learn what it is to do the right thing for our clients and our community and humbly give back to the community where we live and work. Support our associates in times of need through ADP’s Philanthropic Foundation.

Communities can now benefit from the energy produced by their own photovoltaic panels for daily energy use, as well as for charging their electric vehicles. However, it remains a challenge to manage the energy such that individuals maximise their use of energy in a just and fair manner.


**Your job**
------------


In this research project, you will be working towards developing Reinforcement Learning (RL) models that intelligently manage the charging/discharging of electric vehicles in the energy\-mobility\-housing nexus. RL models, however, are often seen as “black\-boxes”. To enhance transparency, you will design methods to reveal the decision\-making structure of the models using Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL). This will allow for an in\-detail analysis of the level of justness and fairness achieved with the proposed RL. For example, with XRL, you will quantify the distribution of benefits and coststhat the RL decision strategy proposes across individuals. You will also identify driving factors and conditions that contribute to the decisions proposed by the RL model.


This Postdoc position is part of a Dutch NWO research project. Within the project, you will have the opportunity to collaborate with several Dutch universities and researchers from multi\-disciplinary backgrounds, and several industrial partners.


**Your qualities**
------------------

* You hold a PhD degree in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics or Operations Research, or you are within a few months from defending your PhD.
* You are familiar with Reinforcement Learning, Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), fairness in Reinforcement Learning models.
* You have demonstrated programming skills (familiarity with Python is a plus).
* You are willing to work in a multi\-disciplinary team with researchers, and with diverse teams of stakeholders.
* You possess collaboration and communication skills with an independent outlook in defining and solving research problems.
* You are proficient in English.
* Familiarity with the topics of charging schemes for electric vehicles, electric grids, and a just energy transition is a plus.


**Our offer**
-------------

* a position for 12 months, with an extension of up to 12 months after a positive evaluation (for a total maximum duration of 24 months);
* a gross monthly starting salary of €4,060 in the case of full\-time employment (salary scale 10\.4 under the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU));
* 8% holiday pay and 8\.3% year\-end bonus;
* a pension scheme, partially paid parental leave and flexible terms of employment based on the CAO NU.


In addition to the terms of employment laid down in the CAO NU, Utrecht University has a number of schemes and facilities of its own for employees.

 The Enterprise Information Management team of Thales in the Netherlands is looking for an experienced BI specialist to further professionalize information management.
   

  

**About The Job**
 Thales in the Netherlands has committed to the objective to become a ‘data\-driven company’, where facts and unambiguous information are leading in decision making. As BI specialist, you will be responsible for gathering the requested business information and designing clear dashboards for our internal customer, the business user. At the start of the week, you check the sprint backlog to see what tasks are assigned to you. You align with the product owner and business analyst of the team and you are in touch with the business user to sharpen the information specifications. Together with the solution architect and data manager, you investigate which data is required to build the dashboard and together you determine how much time it will take to extract and validate the data. You are capable of executing ETL activities yourself. In the meantime, you start designing one component of the new dashboard in PowerBI. You are in close contact with the business user to agree upon the visual design. At the end of the sprint, which takes two weeks, you deliver the new component of the new dashboard, and in the next sprint you will extend your work with a new component.

You could further develop within the domain of BI, yet you could choose to specialize towards IT, or to increase your knowledge about our interesting business and grow to an operational position on the intersection of Business and IT. Furthermore, with some own initiative and a good portion of curiosity, you are able to continue your career at Thales at a completely different department.

The Department of Spatial Economics at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam invites applications for a Horizon Europe\-funded postdoc position in the field of water resources economics.


With 20 partner institutions, this project focuses on using nature\-based solutions (NBS) to enhance climate resilience in water management, particularly in addressing droughts. The postdoctoral researcher will contribute to the economic aspects of NBS implementation, with the primary focus on the design of contractual mechanisms to incentivize the adoption of NBS by landowners. Contract design is based on the combined use of theoretical micro\-economic models, simulations, and economic (lab/field) experiments. The research will integrate insights from economic theory, institutional arrangements, and empirical data from demonstration sites across Europe to develop tailored economic models for water resource management.


The postdoc will work closely with Dr. Erik Ansink at VU and with partner institutions to bridge economic analysis with governance and policy aspects of water management. The role includes engagement with stakeholders to co\-design effective contracts in order to ensure their applicability in each project demonstration site.

We can serve this global network due to our outstanding team of FedEx team members, who are tasked with making every FedEx experience outstanding.

**Our Philosophy**
------------------


The People\-Service\-Profit philosophy (P\-S\-P) describes the principles that govern every FedEx decision, policy or activity. FedEx takes care of our people; they, in turn, deliver the impeccable service demanded by our customers, who reward us with the profitability necessary to secure our future. The essential element in making the People\-Service\-Profit philosophy such a positive force for the company is where we close the circle, and return these profits back into the business, and invest back in our people. Our success in the industry is attributed to our people. Through our P\-S\-P philosophy, we have a work environment that encourages team members to be innovative in delivering the highest possible quality of service to our customers. We care for their well\-being, and value their contributions to the company.

Our culture is important for many reasons, and we intentionally bring it to life through our behaviors, actions and activities in every part of the world. The FedEx culture and values have been a cornerstone of our success and growth since we began in the early 1970’s. While other companies can copy our systems, infrastructure and processes, our culture makes us unique and is often a differentiating factor as we compete and grow in today’s global marketplace.",Big Data,,,,,,,,,,,,gd-1009689362242,,en,,organic,,https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/246/fedex-squarelogo-1557862760250.png,,,,,,

How? By disrupting the traditional supply chain! We skip the auction and wholesale, to shorten the journey for our flowers. And we harness technology, brand and innovation to deliver gifts and subscriptions that delight our customers across Europe.  

We launched in Amsterdam in 2014, and in 2021 joined forces with Bloom \& Wild, the UK's fastest growing ecommerce company (according to the Financial Times). Our group is backed by top tier investors and is now home to a family of 3 strong brands, Bloom \& Wild, bloomon and Bergamotte. Together, we’ve delivered over 20 million orders (and counting!), making us the largest direct to consumer flower business in Europe.  

Our vision is to create the destination for making life a little more thoughtful and beautiful. And we won't stop at flowers and plants. Starting with the Bloom \& Wild brand, we're expanding our gifting offering to other categories like cakes, candles and cocktails. This is all part of our ambition to build Europe's \#1 direct to consumer gifting destination.  

We care wildly about people and our planet. Which is why we’re so proud to be a certified B Corp™ – committed to making long\-term positive change for our community, and the world around us. **️** **Operations Team @ Bloom \& Wild Group**

\- Fulfilment and Customer Operations \- managing our partially outsourced sourcing, production and fulfilment in the UK, optimising our delivery organisation in all countries we are active in and servicing our customers with the Customer Delight team. The team works closely with our partners to achieve operational excellence and optimise for quality and customer satisfaction, delivery performance, capacity and associated COGS.  

The procurement and inventory team is part of our Production and Supply chain domain, and is responsible for the inventory of all non\-horti products used in all warehouses of our group. Among others this covers packaging materials (eg. flowerboxes, wrapping paper, ribbons), lifestyle products (eg. vases, candles, baby clothing), food \& drinks (chocolates, biscuits, alcoholic beverages). With our rapidly expanding range, the amount of categories and products is continuously growing.  

The main responsibility of the procurement and inventory team is ensuring that we have the right materials, in the right place, with the right quality for the best price and in the most sustainable way possible.  

This team is also responsible for optimizing our inventory position to balance maximising availability for customers and limiting our stock holding in line with stock cover goals and supply chain timelines.

Tony’s Chocolonely is committed to ending exploitation in cocoa. We are an impact company that makes chocolate, not a chocolate company that makes impact.

With your leadership, Tony’s Chocolonely will deliver tasty chocolate that consumers love, in great packs, on budget, and at the right time. You will lead the team to use consumer insights, category data, and trend analysis to identify long\-term growth platforms. Using these to envision the future product portfolio, engaging with the local market teams to get their input, and then working with the project management and development teams to create the roadmap of projects to deliver this vision.

* Ensure continuous product ideation and renovation: Ensure there’s a robust funnel of new product ideas that surprise and charm consumers, balancing science and art. You know what good looks like, set the approach, and bring people along.
* Work closely with the broader product team to ensure the product roadmap is brought to life, accepting where and if compromises, trade\-offs, or changes need to be made, but keeping the golden thread of the ideas alive.
* Lead the team by coaching and empowering, fostering an environment of consumer\-first thinking.
* Inspire and work closely with the brand team on packaging design and launch campaigns.
* Foster strong relationships with markets and ensure their unique market conditions, consumer preferences, and trends are heard and considered.

* Product marketing experience: You have launched or been involved in product launches and understand the process from ideation to store shelf.
* Passion for brilliance and innovation balanced with respect for reality and potential financial and manufacturing constraints.

* Strong business understanding and strategic mindset: Ability to see the big picture, but not afraid to roll up your sleeves to ensure brilliant execution.
* Previous leadership experience: Strong leadership \& coaching experience and experience in building high performing, engaged, and happy teams.

* Eagerness to work in a fast\-paced scaleup environment and deal smoothly with the changes that come with a growing company.
* Data\-driven decision\-maker who utilizes data to identify areas of improvement and make objective, informed decisions.

**Our benefits (the icing on the cake)**


At Tony's you will get the opportunity to be part of something extraordinary; first and foremost, by making real impact in the world but also enjoying the nice benefits we provide as you help us succeed. We’re dedicated to enabling all Tonys to grow and develop their careers and therefore we offer training programs, regular feedback cycles, coaching and a generous L\&D budget. We also offer a wide range of additional benefits, including a luxurious vega\-lunch, company bonus, minimum of 28 holidays, inspirational team updates, unforgettable events like the Tony's Carnaval and unlimited chocolate. But we also know chocolate won’t cover the bills, so we’ve made sure your salary is just as rewarding, for this role that means a salary between 87 and 109k on a yearly basis, including holiday pay.

**Sounds like you?**


Are you passionate about making a difference in the world? Look no further! If you're ready to take the chocolate industry to new heights with us, we'd love to hear from you! Please send your direct application, no agencies. We can't wait to hear from you!

As part of the team, your role is to expand the portfolio of studies, ensuring we can provide our clients with answers to their questions. Which patient populations are eligible for the new drugs? How are drugs used in the real world? What is the uptake of newly introduced medicine? What are the real\-world clinical and patient outcomes? How do they compare to the clinical trial results? What you will be doing as Business Development Manager RWE:

* Develop new client relationships within the pharmaceutical industry
* Own, nurture and expand a portfolio of client relationships

The Real World Evidence division is growing and is in full swing. The team is primarily responsible for gaining insights into the use and effect of (expensive) drugs. In view of the aging population, a significant increase in drug use and new drugs is expected – and a corresponding increase in costs. In order to keep these rising costs in check, it is essential to have a very clear picture of the exact effect of medicines. The insights and studies of the Real World Evidence team offer a solution for this.

**Why LOGEX?**


Healthcare today is more tailored and more effective than ever before. However, with these improvements, come greater costs and complexity. The burden of healthcare spending weighs heavily on economies, while the sheer number of options physicians and patients can choose from leads to uncertainty and unacceptable variations in clinical outcomes. At LOGEX, we have one superpower: data analysis. We choose to use this superpower to help address today’s healthcare issues by turning data into better healthcare. Besides a purpose\-driven workplace, we offer you:

* An excellent compensation package (including pension, bonus, 25 holidays, internet\- and phone allowance)
